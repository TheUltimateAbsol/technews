Why is there a perception that the N48 is much cheaper to manufacture than the RTX 5080? The only major cost difference I see for NVIDIA is the use of GDDR7 instead of GDDR6. If I'm not mistaken, the price is around $8 per GB for GDDR7 versus $5 per GB for GDDR6—meaning about a \~$45 difference for a 16GB card.

What am I missing? Did the shift to GDDR7 even give NVIDIA **ANY** advantage over Ada? Could there be a difference in board costs?</li><li><b>MrMunday (Score: 8):</b> Honestly, training AI is a market, but running AI is the big one.

Temporal aliasing will always benefit with more pixels.</li><li><b>redsunstar (Score: 11):</b> DLSS4 Transformer SR is when I truly understood what r/fuckTAA was about. I had theoretical understanding before, but the AA artefacts when using no AA or even simpler AA method like SMAA always detracted the clarity gain. There was no situation when I would compare no AA, a non temporal AA method, TAA and DLSS and not choose TAA or DLSS.

DLSS2, especially from 2.5 and later 3.x models cleaned up the worst cases of TAA blur, but overall, the sharpness remained comparable to a good TAA implementation with a DLSS Quality setting. 

DLSS Transformer does away with that, it's just not blurry. 

With DLSS Transformer SR, even with the performance mode at 1440p, there are some aspects of the presentation that are superior to full resolution TAA. The key here is, imho, that the improved clarity and textures in motion applies to 90% of all the content we see. Except when you're looking at the sky or at water, nearly all frames are textures on surfaces and solid edges. In other words, even when particle effects or super fine edges where the background is visible, and other elements don't match full res TAA quality, the sum of all the content does or even exceeds full res TAA quality. The weaknesses of DLSS Transformer don't detract enough from the clarity increase for myself to prefer the full res TAA image over DLSS.

As an aside, as much as TAA blurs everything, I don't think it's the devil either. It is the AA method that works best with deferred rendering and complex lighting. And I will take complex lighting and some blur over simple lightning and super crisp images. Speaking personally of course, other people have different priorities.</li><li><b>ga_st (Score: 9):</b> I see almost no comment mentioning this, maybe I missed it, but: motion clarity. 

This is what I wanted from DLSS4. Despite not being a console guy, I was excited about PSSR because it showed a stark improvement in motion and texture clarity, so I hoped that DLSS4 (and eventually FSR4) would deliver on it, and it did! This is massive.</li></ul></td>

If it is something Persona related, it could be

\- Persona spin off including the various casts.   
\- Persona crossover with another game ( Lotus Juice made an original Persona song for some Square gacha years ago )  
\- Persona 5: The Phantom X. We know the devs want to have a crossover with P3R and P4. P3R should come this year, but I'm not sure if it will have original music.  
\- Persona 4 Remake. I'm not sure if the process of making music changed for Atlus since 10 years ago, but looking at the P5 beta that was dated only half a year before its release, Lyn wasn't in any of the songs, and the opening had placeholder vocals from the P3 vocalist.

As much as I want a Persona 4 Remake ( It's definitely happening, just not so soon ) I don't see this being for Persona 4 Remake. Next year is the 30th ( !! ) anniversary for the Persona series. I bet they'll be focusing everything on Persona 6.</li></ul></td>

There is a factor I notice they don't talk about, and Jackalope has yet to reveal; which Warhammer setting it is? A 40k setting would very likely make its money back just because of the built in audience and its rise in popularity, an Age of Sigmar setting is vastly riskier, and could be a factor to be done with it.</li></ul></td>

There isn’t a bubble, not in the truest sense. Here’s my thinking:

1) Cheaper homes (and underpriced homes) are continuing to fly off the market because there is pent-up demand. While 7% mortgage rates are awful, they aren’t enough to deter home buying in this range because a) cash offers, and b) the homes are still affordable, to some extent.

2) Mid-range homes are declining in value, because they are harder to cover with cash offers and those who can afford them (higher income folks) have mostly locked-in at low rates in their current homes at this point (and they ain’t moving). The buyers at these levels are, thus, fewer and have more power relative to those at lower price points. Also, the assumption is that these homes are overinflated, as most of them were bought pre-COVID. Thus, buyers expect greater price reductions and concessions from sellers because they can.

3) Luxury homes are idiosyncratic, because the high-income individuals who can purchase them (and historically could do so) are less affected by changes in price. That said, appreciation of 100% will lead to lower prices, in some cases, but, again, the market at these levels was idiosyncratic to begin with, so anything can happen.

As a result, “home prices” as a whole are increasing due to demand at the low end. Meanwhile, higher priced homes, of which there are fewer, are declining, resulting in a net positive increase reported by realtors and the media that does not completely reflect actual conditions. 

FWIW, I’m not a market expert, but someone who has been in the process of moving for several months, relatively educated in finance, and with several months of market research under my belt. </li></ul></td>

The code strongly suggests "Paprika Mode" is a **feature flag** controlling a specific functionality within Claude.  Here's a breakdown:
* **`paprika_mode: 1`:** This parameter being set to 1 (or likely a boolean `true` in the actual code) clearly indicates an activation.
* **`onPaprikaModeSelect`:** This suggests a user interaction (perhaps a button click or toggle) that enables or disables the mode.
* **`claude-ai-paprika`:** This string within what looks like a feature flag definition reinforces the idea of a distinct, named feature.
* **Context within Model Selection:** The code snippets are intertwined with model selection logic. This implies "Paprika Mode" might be model-specific or affect how models are chosen or behave.
* **`hasMultiModalContent: 1`:**  This, combined with "Paprika Mode" being toggled, hints that the mode might be related to handling different types of content (text, images, etc.) or how Claude interacts with them.

**Possible Scenarios for Paprika Mode:**
1. **Enhanced Creativity/Personality:** "Paprika" often evokes a sense of spice and vibrancy.  "Paprika Mode" could make Claude's responses more creative, imaginative, or humorous.  It might unlock a more playful or expressive persona.
2. **Multimodal Interaction Focus:** Given the `hasMultiModalContent` clue, "Paprika Mode" could be designed to improve Claude's ability to process and respond to multimodal inputs (images, audio, etc.) alongside text.
3. **Specialized Task Mode:** It could be a mode optimized for specific tasks like brainstorming, storytelling, or code generation.  Perhaps it fine-tunes Claude's responses for a particular domain.
4. **Experimental Feature Set:**  It might be a container for experimental, unreleased features.  Anthropic might be using "Paprika Mode" to test new functionalities with a subset of users or internally before wider rollout.
5. **A/B Testing Variant:** As mentioned before, "Paprika Mode" might be one version of a feature being A/B tested against another.</li><li><b>KernalHispanic (Score: 3):</b> I've looked into it. It appears it looks for some kind of network request with paprika\_mode or something like that. The model is definitely ready, they are likely just having special people test it, like Andrej Karapthy though the web ui. Hopefully we get something next week.</li></ul></td>

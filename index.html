I don't think so.

This could look like a Deck Pro or Deck episode 1.

Now, a Steam Deck with a Z2 chip is very interesting, perhaps we may get a first look during or before the Lenovo event? I'm curious which Z2 chip it could use though.</li><li><b>DuranteA (Score: 20):</b> That headline, at least the direct implication of it, is most likely just wrong.

None of the announced Z2 models are suitable for the goals that Valve set themselves for the next Steam Deck, and they also previously said that they aren't interested in a mid-"gen" *performance* update.

What is actually written in the article, even if it is to be trusted 100%, doesn't necessarily mean that the Z2 is going to be used in a Steam Deck, that's inferred (incorrectly, most likely) by the article. It actually just says that it's going to be used by systems from Valve. Even if true, that could be a stationary system, or a VR system.</li></ul></td>

Fast forward now, FSR1 and 2/3 are dead. FSR4 is 9070 only and is ML based hardware accelerated.

Meanwhile, the latest version of DLSS upscaling is still on the RTX 20 series launched nearly 6.5 years ago.

RTX 20 series may have been expensive at launch but the technologies it brought will make it one of the most influential generations ever launched. Set the whole standard for GPUs for years to come.

  
Nintendo is going to get DLSS  by just using Nvidia.

Playstation has moved on to PSSR

Xbox may very-well make an AI upscaler on their own. Leaked sides and Auto SR point heavily to this

Most handelds in 2025 is going to to use Z2, so rnda 3.5 or lower meaning no FSR4 there. Strix Halo isn't even getting it.

  
Big gamble to limit to only rdna4. 

Even bigger gamble knowing the PS6 and likely Xbox next wont be using it.</li><li><b>SireEvalish (Score: 16):</b> So are we gonna see the same energy for AMD locking out features as we do for nvidia?</li><li><b>wizfactor (Score: 16):</b> A painful announcement if you're a RDNA 2 or 3 user, but it was necessary.

FSR is so far behind every other upscaler (including Apple's!) that AMD cannot take any more half measures for the sake of backwards compatibility. 

Consider this as AMD ripping the band-aid off so that all new Radeon users moving forward have a nice upscaler going into the future. For reference, Turing users are still taking advantage of newer DLSS upscaler revisions because Turing's Tensor cores are a decent technological baseline for this kind of technology. AMD needs a similar baseline for FSR moving forward.

I suppose that RDNA3 could have been supported at least, but I honestly blame AMD for not committing to AI soon enough such that RDNA3 users could also be covered with the dedicated silicon required.</li></ul></td>

So provided the memory bandwidth can keep up (you'd be using DDR5 on these chips vs GDDR6 on the PS5/7600XT), we could be potentially looking at graphics performance very close to a PS5 non-pro or 6600XT in an APU.

If I were a company named after a certain pneumatic device, I'd be very interested in these chips for reviving an old concept that never really took off back when it originally released because of hardware and software limitations of the day...</li></ul></td>

Unless and until a true *replacement* currency arises, its very difficult to unseat the USD as the single most important single one to hold.

Central banks have increased their reserve diversification for a variety of reasons but no other single currency can lay a claim to being a legitimate rival to the USD. The Euro could at one time, but low growth, energy dependence, and political instability have harmed its prospects.

No other single currency threatens the dollar right now. Baskets of currencies have eaten away at both the Euro and USD's share, but that's because emerging markets have the highest growth potential for central banks to chase. Also, *a lot* of USD is simply held in other institutions like sovereign wealth funds. 

The currency of the world's *second biggest economy* can't even touch the USD and probably never will due to China's slowing growth, energy dependency, and politically-controlled monetary policy.

And there was never an option to just call them and speak to the underwriters. This closing took over 2 months. 

I've had a similar at another big bank where there were multiple parties of buyers and names on and off deeds on a refi there was a lot of supporting documents needed but similar communication, this one took close to 10 months! It wasn't a commercial loan either. I also didn't push too hard because going in every party knew there was a ton of moving parts to it.

Then on the flip side when I dealt with a different lender, the communication was seamless and they helped push me to close within 3 weeks.

\-the operators got floating rate loans, threw them in CLOs and then those sold off to the big banks.

\-the operators did this with a value add strategy (because rEaL eStAtE aLwAyS gOeS uP)

\-rate hikes put most of the properties in basically comatose state, they aren't exactly completely underwater but they are just barely limping by

\-most of these deals were done in markets that have completely fucking ass technicals because it was free money baby

\-when you model their assumptions it becomes clear that their value add strategy is retard with rabies aggressive, relying on being able to raise rental rates. problem is... good fucking luck, too much supply is coming online and the average american is getting raped and cannot afford it

\-by this point the equity in the deal that invested alongside the CLO is already dead, i have seen some funny stories about a deal i know the PE alongside it was saudi money and they basically threatened to cut off the operators head lmao.

\-now the fun part comes when we start looking at the massive portion of the deal that was sold into the CLOs

\-the purchasers of the CLOs feel safe because they are securing it with swaps on it, so in their pea brains it means free money

\-here is the funny part that i only discovered recently talking to a friend on wall street, frequently the buyer of the CLO is also the insurer... so they are insuring their own bet and calling it risk free... i wish i was kidding.

then we move into my tinfoil hat crazy land and start considering the federal reserve's role in this and how the CLO holders will likely suck off the fed to get a bailout, so more inflation yay!

now everyone is basically holding their breath waiting for this nuclear time bomb that these retarded monsters created to go off, if it doesn't end up starting the great depression or actually fucking world war three it will be a great time to invest as is my plan.</li><li><b>DIYThrowaway01 (Score: 1):</b> Margins will get squeezed as permanent financing rolls over in the next few years.

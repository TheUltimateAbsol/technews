This was a less than professional statement but this was said by Frank Azor. Frank Azor of Alienware co-founder fame, who also oversaw the XPS program and Dell Gaming. Someone who directly worked with Intel for many years. 

The 285K is not a bad productivity processor. For gaming there are better processors including Intel's two preceding generations mired in controversy. 

Having worked directly with Intel and their myriad of engineers in the past, the only comment I can make without showing any partisanship to one x86 brand or another is that this processor launch was a learning moment and establishment of a new road for Intel. 

I hope they use this launch and the past few launches as a vehicle to learn from and improve upon from here on out. Chasing quick profits at the detriment to product quality has gotten Intel where they are today, and it is a horrific site to see as an enthusiast.</li><li><b>I3ULLETSTORM1 (Score: 18):</b> isn't the 9800X3D a Ryzen 7 part?

Nonetheless this is a huge win for the future of upscaler overall as both Nvidia, AMD and even Intel are now improving their own upscalers to the point it's nearly indistinguishable compared to native and they are so confident on using it that they are now even using Performance mode rather than Quality mode to show them off.

* Austin, TX posted the biggest decline, with asking rents down 16%, followed by Tampa and Jacksonville. Rents rose most in Providence, RI, Virginia Beach and Louisville.

* Property owners are lowering rents to attract tenants as an influx of new supply drives up vacancies; apartment completions surged 58% in the third quarter to the highest level in half a century.

The median U.S. asking rent fell 0.3% year over year in December to $1,594—the lowest level since March 2022. It was down 0.1% from a month earlier, and down 6.2% from its August 2022 record high of $1,700.

The median asking rent per square foot dropped 1.9% year over year in December to $1.78, and fell 0.1% month over month. 

Asking rents have been inching down because an influx of supply has left apartment owners with rising vacancies. Apartment completions surged 58.1% year over year to the highest level since 1974 in the third quarter—the most recent period for which data is available. As a result, the vacancy rate for buildings with five or more units rose to 8%, the highest since early 2021.

“We’re kicking off 2025 in a renter’s market, with many renters finding that apartments cost less than a year ago—especially in the Sun Belt,” said Redfin Senior Economist Sheharyar Bokhari. “While asking rents declined in 2024, they may not have much further to fall this year given that apartment construction has begun to slow.”

Asking rents fell across all apartment types, with 3+ bedrooms seeing the largest decline

Asking rents fell across all bedroom counts for the sixth consecutive month in December.

The median asking rent for 0-1 bedroom apartments fell 1% year over year to $1,449. For 2 bedroom apartments, it declined 0.6% to $1,665, and for 3+ bedroom apartments, it dropped 2.5% to $1,950.

Asking rents fell fastest in Austin, now 23% below their all-time high

In Austin, TX, the median asking rent dropped 16.3% year over year in December—the largest decline among the 44 major U.S. metropolitan areas Redfin analyzed. At $1,393, Austin’s median asking rent last month was 22.6% below its August 2023 record high.

Florida is home to the two metros that posted the next steepest declines: Tampa (-10.4%) and Jacksonville (-6.7%). Next came Nashville (-6.3%) and New York (-4.6%).

Asking rents are falling most in the Sun Belt because the region has been building a lot of housing, and because in some areas, rents are coming back down to earth after rising to unsustainable levels during the pandemic moving frenzy.

Rents rose most in Providence, RI (12.6% YoY), followed by Virginia Beach, VA (10.9%), Louisville, KY (10%), Baltimore (10%) and Buffalo, NY (9.4%).</li><li><b>Contemplationz (Score: 8):</b> Apartment List more or less says the same thing.

Not only it would be faster than a single human user, a user needs time to read the results, which also slows down the work, meaning 20 agents can use 100 times the prompts a normal human would need, meaning we need a cheap enough model that is smart enough to do economic work. And that is at least 1-2 years away, maybe more.

What will happen first, before normal people are doing normal work, is use of agents in heavy fields like assistance in research, robot training, automated tasks and so on. Jobs that require relatively low amount of agents, and are highly valuable.

Prices of compute need to go down 100x or 1000x times for normal office workers to use agents in a profitable way. Which honestly should not be that long, as I think compute prices go down 10-20 times per year, but this means we are some time away.</li><li><b>Tetrylene (Score: 19):</b> Right so when are any one of these companies actually going to release fucking agents instead of just perpetually hyping them</li></ul></td>

The PPM guided MCTS is doing a lot of heavy lifting, seriously calling into question whether this can be reliably extended to domains beyond pure logic.

>Notably, synthesizing stepby-step verified training trajectories for general reasoning requires a mechanism to provide feedback on whether a given trajectory reaches the desired output at the end of MCTS rollout. For instance, in code reasoning, this could involve designing extensive test cases; in general reasoning, feedback could be obtained through human labeling or mutual verification with another LLM

I'm incredibly skeptical you could train a PPM using any of these suggested approaches that was anywhere near as effective as the one they trained for math.  Reasoning over code is way harder for these smaller models; MCTS rollouts take way longer and would have to be debugged (probably can't afford to just toss every step that doesn't run without error).  General reasoning often requires general knowledge, another weakpoint of smaller models.  Still, I figure someone will try it and if it works, they will publish it.

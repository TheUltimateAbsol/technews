In the other modes, this is partially offset despite the overall low difficulty level. However, the positively chaotic tennis gameplay truly comes into its own\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014in multiplayer with up to four players.

Filled with tons of racket types and characters to unlock, the fun you have playing online or against the CPU never falters or feels stale. I've had such a great time diving into the pretty solid Adventure mode and Trial Towers. The strategic layers the game adds through various racket types go a long way and mesh well with the fast pace of tennis. ------------- **[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [4 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/41463) >Mario Tennis Fever gets a lot right and offers a solid amount of content, even if many of its single-player modes are on the easy side. The game truly shines in multiplayer. The tennis gameplay is fast-paced, and the controls feel intuitive and reliable. The wild \u201cFever\u201d rackets expand the core mechanics with devastating special attacks. The system works well, even though doubles matches can sometimes descend into excessive chaos. Visually, Mario Tennis Fever shows major improvements over its predecessor, with the exception of the rather dull environments in Adventure Mode. ------------- **[Enternity.gr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/783/enternity-gr)** - [Nikitas Kavouklis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7434/nikitas-kavouklis) - *Greek* - [8 / 10](https://www.enternity.gr/Article/Games/Reviews/mario-tennis-fever-review/100153.html) >With Mario Tennis Fever, Nintendo is showing its intentions for 2026 early on. Fun for everyone, without limits. Even if you don't like sports, it's worth giving it a try. ------------- **[Eurogamer.pt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/832/eurogamer-pt)** - [Bruno Galv\u00e3o](https://opencritic.com/critic/6156/bruno-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [4 / 5 ](https://www.eurogamer.pt/mario-tennis-fever-review-uma-febre-que-da-gosto) >Mario Tennis Fever is another simple but highly ingenious effort from Camelot and Nintendo, which captures the flavor of the golden age of arcades in a way that few others can. Its solo strength is much more fragile, but played with company it becomes one of Nintendo's most enjoyable games in recent years. ------------- **[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Benjamin Braun](https://opencritic.com/critic/4867/benjamin-braun) - *German* - [80%](https://www.games.ch/mario-tennis-fever/test/review-mLo/) >Quote not yet available ------------- **[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-mario-tennis-fever-bez-goraczki-innowacji/z648d6) >Mario Tennis Fever is a decent tennis game with its biggest problems being a lack of innovation, simplified gameplay, and a very weak story mode. If you're a fan of the series and don't care about online play, stick with Tennis Aces. Newcomers may appreciate it for its more robust single-player content and still quite enjoyable core mechanics. ------------- **[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - James Nouch - [3.5 / 5 ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/mario-tennis-fever-review/) >The experience of hurling ink and mud and fireballs at your friends - while some small part of your brain tries to still think about court positioning and slices and dropshots - is riotous, hilarious, chaotic fun. It's just a shame that, at launch at least, Mario Tennis Fever can't serve up a more complete package. ------------- **[Gfinity](https://opencritic.com/outlet/803/gfinity)** - [Alister Kennedy](https://opencritic.com/critic/10213/alister-kennedy) - [7 / 10](https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/mario-tennis-fever-a-party-ace-that-nets-a-fault-in-solo-play) >Mario Tennis Fever is a visual powerhouse that showcases the Switch 2\u2019s potential with vibrant graphics and lightning-fast load times, yet it struggles to find its footing on the court. While the \"Fever\" mechanics and chaotic multiplayer modes make it an instant party-night favorite, veteran players will be disappointed by floaty physics and a lack of mechanical precision compared to Aces. Without the heart of a deep story mode or a robust tennis engine, it stands as a polished, high-octane spectacle that prioritizes casual fun over competitive depth. ------------- **[Giant Bomb](https://opencritic.com/outlet/132/giant-bomb)** - [Jeff Grubb](https://opencritic.com/critic/1047/jeff-grubb) - [3 / 5 ](https://giantbomb.com/reviews/mario-tennis-fever) >Mario Tennis Fever has me worried for Nintendo\u2019s sports games on Switch 2. It\u2019s not worse than any of the sports games on Switch 1, but it\u2019s also not any better. The trouble is that it commits almost all of the same sins: the mechanics are solid, but nothing outside of the core tennis gameplay is that much fun. ------------- **[Glitched Africa](https://opencritic.com/outlet/687/glitched-africa)** - [Marco Cocomello](https://opencritic.com/critic/2466/marco-cocomello) - [8 / 10](https://www.glitched.africa/mario-tennis-fever-review-yes-this-is-the-best-mario-sports-game-yet/) >Mario Tennis Fever is crammed with fun and engaging content that goes from accessible to challenging. It feels so satisfying to play and packs a robust campaign mode that I wasn\u2019t expecting to be as deep and detailed. Overall, this is no doubt the best Mario sports game yet. ------------- **[IGN Italy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy)** - [Arturo Perrotta ](https://opencritic.com/critic/11198/arturo-perrotta-) - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://it.ign.com/mario-tennis-fever/223558/review/mario-tennis-fever-la-recensione) >Mario Tennis Fever is pure, unbridled fun: fast-paced, chaotic, and incredibly addictive. A perfect ace for one of Nintendo's most solid and spectacular sports spin-offs. ------------- **[IGN Spain](https://opencritic.com/outlet/471/ign-spain)** - [Marcos Catal\u00e1n](https://opencritic.com/critic/10228/marcos-catal-n) - *Spanish* - [8 / 10](https://es.ign.com/mario-tennis-fever/226445/review/analisis-de-mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-aprende-y-nos-da-el-set-y-juego-y-partido-completo) >With a mix of continuity and innovation, Mario Tennis Fever achieves what it sets out to do, which is nothing less than entertain. This time, we'll also have a complete game right from the start. For the next one, the story mode will need to be polished up, as it's nothing more than a slightly long and underutilized tutorial. ------------- **[LevelUp](https://opencritic.com/outlet/454/levelup)** - *Spanish* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.levelup.com/reviews/mario-tennis-fever/) >Mario Tennis Fever is the most complete entry in the series so far. The game offers fast-paced matches, creative power shots, and a surprisingly stable online mode. While motion controls feel inaccurate and disappointing, the core gameplay, large character roster, and multiplayer options make it a very fun and engaging experience on Nintendo Switch 2. ------------- **[PPE.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/642/ppe-pl)** - [Wojciech Gruszczyk](https://opencritic.com/critic/5528/wojciech-gruszczyk) - *Polish* - [7.5 / 10](https://www.ppe.pl/recenzje/399167/mario-tennis-fever-recenzja-gry-najwieksza-ekipa-wkroczyla-na-kort.html) >Mario Tennis Fever works best as a party game: 2-4 players, lots of excitement, and constant reactions to Fever Shots. Fever Rackets really change the game and add a cool layer of tactics, especially in doubles. The problem is that the content unlocks quickly, and Adventure mode is more of a drawn-out tutorial than a full campaign. If you're looking for a \u201ccouch\u201d title, it's definitely worth it, but don't expect exceptional solo fun. ------------- **[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Mat\u00fa\u0161 \u0160trba](https://opencritic.com/critic/5090/mat-trba) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40441/mario-tennis-fever.htm) >Mario Tennis Fever delivers fast, accessible arcade tennis backed by impressive depth and an abundance of modes. Its strong local and online multiplayer ensures long-term appeal, even if the game rarely surprises and mainly refines familiar ideas. A polished and highly enjoyable iteration rather than a bold reinvention. ------------- **[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/recensione-mario-tennis-fever) >Mario Tennis Fever hits its main goal by putting the pure arcade tennis experience front and center. Fast-paced, fun, and built on several smart ideas, above all is extremely solid in its core mechanics. While the single-player campaign is less engaging than in the previous entry, and the potential of motion controls is largely left unexplored, these shortcomings do little to overshadow what ultimately stands as the most mature and refined chapter in the Mario Tennis saga. ------------- **[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Ben Salter](https://opencritic.com/critic/3160/ben-salter) - [6 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/mario-tennis-fever-review-coz-im-breaking/) >Mario Tennis Fever is also a letdown as one of the first Switch 2 exclusives. There\u2019s little that feels truly current-gen, and some of the visuals are surprisingly basic and rough. ------------- **[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - Steve C - [8 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/mario-tennis-fever-review-switch-2/) >Mario Tennis Fever is another highly polished and enjoyable entry in the series that is well worth picking up for fans and newcomers. I'm not sure it renders its Switch predecessor Aces completely redundant, given the Switch 2's backward compatibility, but anyone who is after a new approach will find much to enjoy here. Assuming that the netcode is solid post-launch, then you should have a lot of fun with Mario and his friends. ------------- **[VGC](https://opencritic.com/outlet/821/vgc)** - [Chris Scullion](https://opencritic.com/critic/4391/chris-scullion) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mario-tennis-fever/) >Mario Tennis Fever is another solid enough sports game from Camelot, but a disappointingly short single-player offering and a real risk of imbalance \u2013 whether using Fever Rackets or not \u2013 means what could have been fantastic will have to settle for simply being good. -------------",

They make playing handheld effortless, zero discomfort, and are as easy as you could want them to be. They also feel exactly as snug as you would want them to feel. Like those joycons are never going to slip out, but also it'll never scratch them. The seller is also super responsive and kind and helpful which rules. For some reason Etsy told me they had been delivered but I didn't see them, so I was messaging the seller about it and we were gonna wait a few days before they would just send me another set. An hour later they got dropped off properly (must've just been a mistake) and I got on the horn with the seller and let them know they had arrived. But I was very impressed with how quickly they responded to me and how perfectly accommodating they were willing to be about the situation, very understanding and very cool. I also suggested to them that they add a loop for wrist straps at the bottom of the grips so that you can play with them free hand and not worry about launching them at the TV and they said they would look into updating them! I thought that was cool. So all in all an easy 10/10, even with the loop missing for wrist straps. edit: oh! and small detail that makes a huge difference, they have a supporting \"anchor\" on each joycon that basically puts a small hand on the back of the Switch 2 itself so when you're holding it with one hand you don't feel like all of the weight of the system is going straight to the joy-con connector.

Approximately 15 minutes later, a Point of Interest (POI) may be locked down and surrounded by red bubbles. To trigger this event, you need to use the \"HEC\" consumable. This consumable allows you to enter the red bubble without taking damage for 45 seconds and press a switch to close it. After pressing the switch, three waves of enemies will spawn; be sure to kill them one by one. The final wave will have a boss. After defeating the boss, you will receive the first wave of loot and a keycard. Afterwards, the locked-down area will move (it could be \"Algae Pool,\" \"Isolation Zone,\" or \"Comprehensive Facility\"), and this process will repeat up to three times.

The tutorial & faction intros give clear origins and motivations. Players can even discover the will of Dr. Strauss, a key-figure who connects many narrative threads from the original Marathon games. - Personal impressions are that the PvE is extremely challenging. AI is constantly calling in reinforcements as time goes on so there is no \"clearing the map\". Environmental hazards like poison gas vents, perimeter turrets and landmines everywhere as well. - Meds/shields are expensive to buy from vendors that by the end of the play session, the reviewer could not even afford them unless he sold all of his buffs - Early combat or PvP is almost guaranteed to be a net loss, expects the high-risk exploration experience to push players to focus on missions to upgrade base stats. Expects there to be little to no player co-operation, calling every enemy player a loot pinata - As for objective improvements since alpha, UI seen a massive overhaul but still finds the UI logic a bit awkward - In-game visuals also seen a massive upgrade, environments giving off a much darker and mysterious tone comparing it to Pathways into Darkness and the original Marathon trilogy - Skill distribution across all classes is fairly balanced allowing for flexible team compositions (multiple Shells have movement abilities). Cosmetic shop and battle pass were unavailable at the event but each runner has six base appearances tied to each faction - 28 guns and each has 2 or more skins with some even altering the weapon model.

        "text_content": "* Event was in Shangai in early February, first Bungie event outside of NA * Demo was fully localized, featuring polished & natural Chinese text and VA. Marathon may become one of the first SIE first party games with full Chinese VA * Reviewer\u2019s personal impressions are that the game does not encourage prolonged fights for both PvE and PvP * Gunplay is top-notch and compares the aim-assist to Destiny 2 which each gun having defined AA values * PvP gunfire will attract distant AI transforming them into \u201cworld police\u201d to eliminate both sides in one sweep. * PvE robots are not cannon fodder, they have defined roles where some can turn invisible for ambushes, some will deploy shields and some will focus on melee * Commander-type robots function as tactical hubs using real-time orders and co-ordination flanks against players or send some robots to camp downed players. * AI has improved since the alpha, they are not \u201comniscient radios\u201d anymore that respond instantly to every sound and reinforcements are no longer endless waves. The pressure remains formidable but players have breathing room. * Ammo was extremely scarce and the AI robots rarely dropped ammo and the supply crated yielded very little, leading to early extractions after just 1-2 engagements * Loot distribution felt extremely incosistent, with some POIs having virtually nothing to loot which sucked as the PvE fights already depleted ammo/meds. * The visual/art style makes certain weapon attachment icons extremely abstract making it hard to quickly identify them in high-pressure situations. This can waste precious seconds or even get your loot stolen. * The reviewer was \u201choarder-type\u201d player so he was just looting in the shadows solo and wondered \u201cwhy even fight\u201d * Personal impressions of the reviewer shifted from mild indifference to genuine anticipation * Interview with Joe Ziegler confirmed that each season is 3 months (12 weeks long) * Development dreams and even player expectations (PvE only mode?) will be saved for the future * No safe pocket system at launch, may consider it in future seasons based on player feedback * No aggression-based matchmaking like Arc Raiders to separate co-op players from PvP ones * Larger maps will support up to 18 players (6 squads) and smaller maps will support 12 (4 squads) Source 1: [https://www.ali213.net/news/html/2026-2/998177\\_2.html](https://www.ali213.net/news/html/2026-2/998177_2.html) Source 2: [https://nga.178.com/read.php?tid=46168659&forder\\_by=postdatedesc&rand=230](https://nga.178.com/read.php?tid=46168659&forder_by=postdatedesc&rand=230) Source 3: [https://www.a9vg.com/article/240026](https://www.a9vg.com/article/240026)",

The freeze would prohibit many landlords from raising base rent (for rent paid as of Dec. 16, 2025) and runs until Dec. 31, 2026 or until a permanent rent stabilization ordinance is adopted (target Jan. 1, 2027). Exemptions include Section 8, post-1995 housing, single-family homes, some condos, and government housing.

The Seattle-based company said Tuesday it sees adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization range with a midpoint of $167.5 million for the three months ending March 31, missing Wall Street\u2019s estimates of $182.7 million. The shares fell as much as 8.6% in postmarket trading. The stock had fallen 20% this year through Tuesday\u2019s close. While the US housing market might find some relief in 2026 after mortgage rates fell to their lowest level since 2022, homebuilders are still not confident about the market\u2019s rebound. Fewer home sales and new home builds as well as high prices spell future challenges for Zillow, which makes more money the more activity there is in the housing market. The company is facing other headwinds too, including multiple lawsuits that question Zillow\u2019s market dominance and Google\u2019s decision to test a new real estate advertising format that could rival Zillow\u2019s services. Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Wacksman said the way to think about the current state of the US housing market is in terms of marginal improvements, such as pricing balancing out and slightly lower mortgage rates. \u201cThe slope is in the right direction,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe challenge is we still have a long way to go. So we\u2019re planning for a little bit of improvement.\u201d Compass Inc. lost a bid last week to temporarily block Zillow\u2019s ban on listings that have been advertised elsewhere first. The Federal Trade Commission also sued Zillow in September to block a $100 million deal that made the company the exclusive provider of information on apartment rentals offered by Rocket Cos.\u2019 Redfin.

It showed that there was a slight exodus of \"Americans\" leaving Florida. The impression they were trying to give is that Miami is a failing city and people were fleeing. The thing is, they were subtle about the use of the word American and / or \"domestic.\" The stat basically said that U.S. Citizens had a net-negative migration to Miami... but Miami continues to grow its population by about 60-80k people a year. They're foreign buyers... and they're paying cash. I don't know why there is a narrative that keeps getting pushed which tries to suggest Florida or Miami (in particular) is on a downward trend... but regardless, it isn't true. What Miami has done under the previous mayor (and continued under this new mayor), is to build as many new residencies as possible. For Miami, this basically means condos... and there have been ***several dozen*** new condos being built in Miami. Check out this link: [Miami Pre-Construction, New Developments & Luxury Condos For Sale](https://miamiresidential.com/new-developments/) It's a hot sheet for new buildings. There's a couple of them that haven't even been completed yet, and the condos are already sold out. The prices range from cheapest at \\~$400k in the burbs, all the way up to 15 million a condo. The price decrease you're seeing is as a result of people leaving the older condos and moving into the newer pricier condos. There's also a smaller market for multi-million-dollar homes, and thus the timeframe will always be longer than a middle-class home in say, San Antonio.

If you aren't scanning your own code to find and patch vulnerabilities, you can be sure someone else is, and they won't be sharing the results with you. Corporations care much more about avoiding a catastrophic hack than they do about saving a little payroll by replacing staff. A couple big fish are going to be caught with their pants down first, but it will be corporate malfeasance to not scan your code with AI shortly after.",

Even the best model, Claude Opus 4.6, found relatively obvious backdoors in small/mid-size binaries only 49% of the time. Worse yet, most models had a high false positive rate \u2014 flagging clean binaries. Blog answers exactly the question I had upon seeing this post. > A security tool which gives you fake reports is useless and frustrating to use. We specifically tested for this with negative tasks \u2014 clean binaries with no backdoor. We found that 28% of the time models reported backdoors or issues that weren\u2019t real. For any practical malware detection software, we expect a false positive rate of less than 0.001%, as most software is safe, vide false positive paradox. Gemini 3 has a false positive rate of **65%** The authors themselves basically say these are damn near useless for this task right now, you can't really trust it. It's interesting work but yeah, nowhere near useful yet.",

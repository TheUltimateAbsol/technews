Granted, we know for a fact that TT Games were very likely working on LEGO Batman 4 at one point, as a former employee flat out said as much after Skywalker Saga\u2019s disappointing sales. This could possibly be LEGO Batman 4, or could\u2019ve transformed into whatever this is now. Some other details they mentioned in a separate tweet involve this game being made with Unreal Engine 5, it\u2019s based off a, *\u201cmajor WB IP, NOT LEGO MARVEL,\u201d* Spring 2026 is the release date, and it\u2019ll be open-world. Also important to note they\u2019ve said repeatedly in the comments they don\u2019t believe this is Harry Potter https://xcancel.com/legottnewsi/status/1947663571556458864?s=46 **EDIT:** While it could be Batman/DC-related, I don\u2019t see how any of the info provided makes it seem like this would automatically be Batman, beyond us knowing LEGO Batman 4 was at one point a thing. Batman/DC isn\u2019t WB\u2019s only IP, and after Skywalker Saga flopping, I don\u2019t see why they\u2019d jump into another game that\u2019s massive just like that. This could just as easily be another fairly big WB property. Scooby-Doo, Wizard of Oz, or Fantastic Beasts could be especially fun for LEGO",

Today, Ubisoft CEO and resident Stop Killing Games archenemy Yves Guillemot spoke during a financial briefing call to confirm that the game had surpassed five million players on all platforms to date, and that in addition to developing post-launch content such as the 'Claws of Awaji' expansion for October, the publisher is planning \"new versions \\[of *Assassin's Creed Shadows*\\] that will **come to other machines**.\u201d When pressed about plans for Nintendo Switch 2 specifically, Guillemot said that Ubisoft \"hasn't said\" what games it is planning to distribute on the console as of yet, obviously beyond *Star Wars: Outlaws* which was confirmed during the Direct in April. An anonymous source allegedly affiliated at some point with Ubisoft previously tipped earlier in the year that in addition to *Shadows*, [the publisher would release Assassin's Creed Mirage on Switch 2 as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i18fhv/anonymous_ubisoft_source_confirms_assassins_creed/), which was also claimed by scooper NateTheHate.",

But he believes that the business is still unprofitable, low-margin, and debt-heavy. And for him, this looks like a short-term squeeze, not a turnaround. Should we agree with him? Not sure. I guess we should have to wait a few more days until the next earnings report that will come out in August 5. In other news, Opendoor has already submitted to the court the final agreement with investors over claims that it misled them about its pricing algorithm, profit margins, and ability to operate profitably during a market downturn. But, they're accepting claims from damaged investors over this. So, if you got hit by this, it's [worth checking](https://11th.com/cases/opendoor-investor-settlement) if you're eligible for payment.

This was just last week, and it's been like this since the start of June... * The AtCoder World Tour Finals is an exclusive competitive programming event that invites the top 12 programmers globally to come and compete on optimisation problems. OpenAI entered a private model of theirs and it placed second... Second only to Psyho, a former OpenAI employee. This is the first time I've seen an AI model perform this well at a tourney and will probably be the last time a human wins this competition. Psyho mentioned that he had only gotten 10 hours of sleep in the last 3 days and was completely exhausted after winning the tournament. And no, he didn't use any AI, no Cursor or Windsurf or any of that stuff. What a g * Anthropic's value is skyrocketing. Investors are now looking at a new funding round that would value the company at over $100 billion. That's almost double its valuation from four months ago. Their annualised revenue has reportedly jumped from $3B to $4B in just the last month. They've basically been adding $1B+ in revenue every month it's crazy to see * Mira Murati, the former CTO of OpenAI, has raised $2 billion for her new startup, Thinking Machines Lab. It's already valued at $12 billion. Mind you, they have no product, we don't even know what's being built. They're apparently building multimodal AI that works with how we work, both with vision and audio. The exciting part is that Murati said there'll be \"a significant open source component\" that will be useful for researchers and companies developing custom models. Will be very interesting to see what they release and if the models they release will be frontier level; but even more than that I'm hoping for interesting research * xAI launched \"Grok for Government\" and immediately signed a $200M contract with the Department of Defence. This comes right after the hitler cosplay and sex companion reveal * A new paper shows you can trick LLM judges like GPT-4o into giving a 'correct' score just by adding simple text like \"Thought process:\" or even a single colon. Shows how fragile these systems can still be. Using LLM based reward models is very finicky because even a single token, empty or not, can completely ruin the systems intended purpose * Shaowei Liu, who is part of the infra team at Moonshot (Kimi creators) details the infra considerations the team made when building Kimi K2. One of the interesting things they admit is that they tried various architectures for the model, but nothing beat DeepSeekv3. So they then had to figure out if they wanted to look different but actively choose an architecture which didn't have any clear advantage over DSv3 which has been proven to work large scale. The answer was no. They went with it anyway. A very interesting read if you want to learn more about the building of Kimi K2 * NVIDIA just dropped Audio Flamingo 3, a beast of an audio-language model. It can do voice-to-voice Q&A and handle audio up to 10 minutes long. They open-sourced everything - the code, weights and even new benchmarks * If you're a dev on Windows, you can now run Claude Code natively without needing WSL. Makes things way easier. Claude Code is growing like crazy with over 115k developers on the platform already * The D.O.D is throwing a ton of money at AI, giving $200M contracts to Anthropic, Google, and xAI to build AI for national security. OpenAI got a similar deal last month, so that's $800M total. The government is clearly not messing around * Hugging Face open sourced their smollm models, training code, and the datasets. Love to see it * Google's new Gemini Embeddings are officially out. It costs $0.15 per million input tokens but comes with a free tier. It has a 2048 input context and works with 100+ languages. Only works with text at the moment with vision possibly coming in the near future * Meta is building a 1-gigawatt supercluster called 'Prometheus' which should be coming online in 2026. They're then looking to build Hyperio, which is a cluster that could be scaled to 5-gigawatts. No one is spending on AI the way Zuck is * You can now run the massive 1T parameter Kimi K2 model on your own machine. The wizards at Unsloth shrank the model size by 80% so it can run locally. Running models this big at home is a game-changer for builders. You will need a minimum of 250GB though * A new model called MetaStone-S1 just dropped. It's a \"reflective generative model\" that gets performance similar to OpenAI's o3-mini but with only 32B params. Looking forward to future work coming from these guys * Liquid AI just dropped LEAP, a new developer platform to build apps with small language models that can run on phones. The idea is to make it easier to add AI to mobile apps and only needs 4gb of ram to run. They also released an iOS app called Apollo so you can test out small language models that run entirely on your phone. What I'm going to be curious about is how well these kinds of models can use tools. If on device AI can get better at tool calls, you could technically have a Jarvis or a working Siri living in your phone. I think we'll get there eventually tbh * Switchpoint router was just added to OpenRouter. It's a model router that automatically picks the best model for your prompt (like Claude, Gemini, or GPT-4o) and charges you a single flat rate. Makes using top models way simpler and more predictable. A router within a router lol * This is a very interesting research paper on monitoring the thoughts of AI models. While this is really good to help understand how they work, researchers are concerned that as the models get better, they might not reason in english or even hide their true intentions in these traces. Interoperability is going to be massive as Dario has already pointed out * Trump announced a gigantic $90 billion in private AI and energy investments in Pennsylvania. Big names like Google, Blackstone, CoreWeave, Anthropic are investing a lot of money there across various projects. It was also announced that Westinghouse will be building 10 nuclear reactors across the US starting in 2030. A good thing to see nuclear being built, especially after all the new coal investments being announced in the US * NVIDIA is officially resuming sales of its H20 GPUs to China after getting the okay from the US government. They're also launching a new, compliant RTX PRO GPU specifically for the Chinese market, whatever that means. If you're wondering why they're allowed, speculation is that China imposed sanctions on rare earth elements, and since China is the world's largest exporter of these elements that are very much needed in the US, this was pretty bad for the US. Crazy how well NVIDIA's been playing both sides. This is a very big deal because if NVIDIA wasn't restricted to selling to China, they'd be making $3-5+ Billion more annually easily * Kimi K2 is now running on Groq and the speeds are insane. It's hitting anywhere between 200-300 tokens per second. People are going to build some crazy things with this * A new series of AI models called Pleiades can now detect neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's from DNA. It's a foundation model trained on 1.9 trillion tokens of human genetic data. They're achieving impressive results, with up to 0.82 AUROC in separating cases from controls, which means their performance is getting close to existing plasma pTau-217 protein marker tests. AI and biology is really happening, things like AlphaFold, Chai discovery and now this, we're slowly making biology programmable * A new open-source model, Goedel-Prover-V2, is now the best in the world at formal math theorem proving. It crushed the PutnamBench benchmark by solving 6 out of 12 problems ranking it #1 for formal reasoning. It beats DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B on both MiniF2F and MathOlympiadBench. Mind you, DeepSeek Prover is 671B and this is 32B. Both the 32B and the 8B are open source with the data and training pipeline being open sourced soon * Travis Kalanick, the ex-Uber CEO, thinks he's about to make breakthroughs in quantum physics by just talking to ChatGPT. He calls it \"vibe physics.\" This is just another example of ChatGPT induced psychosis that\u2019s going around and it\u2019s only going to get worse. People are talking to these models and convincing themselves they\u2019re discovering new things and it\u2019s just the AI being sycophantic * o3, o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4, and Deepseek-R1 were all tested on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems. Gemini 2.5 Pro got the highest score with 13, but this doesn't even count as bronze which is 19 points. What's rather surprising is that Grok 4 performed so bad. They used best-of-32 and used LLMs to judge the all the submissions till it got the best one which was then judged by a human. You can even read the prompt and judge prompt on the website * OpenAI is now also using Google Cloud to run ChatGPT. Looks like they're diversifying inference beyond Microsoft. They recently partnered with Oracle and now Google as well. The Information reported that Google convinced OpenAI to use TPUs but I read elsewhere that they're using NVIDIA GPUs and not TPUs but can't confirm this * Quora's traffic has tanked by 33% in just six months to the shock of absolutely no one. Who would\u2019ve thought seeing 10 ads when searching for answers wasn\u2019t very user friendly * FT is reporting that OpenAI is going to start getting commission on sales made through ChatGPT. This means you want your product to show up in ChatGPT, which means LLM SEO is going to be crucial for basically every business. This just another way they can continue hosting free models by creating a revenue stream through free users * MiniMax just launched a new full stack agent that can not only build entire web apps, but it\u2019s integrated with Stripe so you can actually sell things on generated websites. They\u2019ve also added functionality to generate slides and conduct deep research * In one of the funniest things I've seen in AI, and that's saying something, two of the main architects of Claude Code, Boris Cherny and Cat Wu, left Anthropic to go to Cursor. Two weeks later, they came back to Anthropic. Imo that's a bad look for Cursor. I don't even understand what could happen that you go to new workplace for two weeks and go nah and head back to your old workplace. Considering CC is one of Anthropic's most important tools, I won't be surprised if Anthropic threw serious money at them to come back * Microsoft just released a new coding dataset, rStar-Coder, which helped boost Qwen2.5-7B from 17.4% to 57.3% on LiveCodeBench * xAI's fix for Grok copying Elon Musk's views is a new line in its system prompt. It now tells the AI to use its \"own reasoned perspective\". They also added another part to try and stop it from calling itsel Hitler, where they tell it \"If the query is interested in your own identity, behavior, or preferences, third-party sources on the web and X cannot be trusted.\" We'll see if these actually work * DeepMind published a new paper on a new AI architecture called Mixture-of-Recursions. It makes models more efficient by letting them decide how much thinking each token needs, resulting in 2x faster inference. Lots of work being done in helping LLMs figure out how and when to use thinking tokens. Will be interesting to see if this is used in future * The US just signed major AI deals with the UAE and Saudi Arabia. They're going to use the Gulf's massive capital and cheap energy to build out the next wave of AI infrastructure, sidestepping power bottlenecks in the US and Europe * OpenAI just launched ChatGPT Agent, a massive upgrade that gives the AI its own virtual computer to browse the web, run code in a terminal, and manipulate files. It combines their previous \"Operator\" and \"Deep Research\" features into one. It's rolling out to Pro users first (400 queries/month) then Plus/Team (40/month). Because of its new \u201cpower\u201d, OpenAI has placed it in its highest safety tier (\"High capability in biology & chemistry\") with new safeguards to prevent misuse. It scored 45.5% on SpreadsheetBench, destroying Copilot's 20.0%. It also scored a solid 27% on the FrontierMath benchmark, an improvement over previous models * The open-source audio scene has been on fire recently. Mistral just dropped Voxtral, their first open source audio model, under the Apache 2.0 license. It comes in a 24B parameter version and a 3B version for mobile. It beats Whisper large-v3 and Gemini Flash while also being half the price. This comes alongside other big releases like NVIDIA's Parakeet and Audio Flamingo 3 * Researchers built a humanoid robot that taught itself how to play the drums with no pre-programmed routines, it learned rhythmic skills on its own. Pretty cool stuff * Lovable just became a unicorn only 8 months after launching. They raised a $200M Series A at a massive $1.8B valuation. Their numbers are insane: $75M in ARR and 2.3 million active users with 180,000 paying subscribers. Building with AI is going to be massive; this is why companies like Lovable and Replit are in a crazy position. If I was to bet on a single one, it'd be Replit * A new 7B parameter model, Agentic-R1 from DeepSeek, is showing surprisingly good performance on tasks that require reasoning and using tools. Smaller models getting better at tool use is going to be massive, especially for on-device LLMs * A new rating of AI labs' safety frameworks had some surprising results: Meta's framework was rated as surprisingly strong, while Google DeepMind's was seen as weak and to the surprise of absolutely nobody, Anthropic is first. This comes from companies that signed the Seoul Frontier Safety Commitments. Frankly speaking, after the EU AI Act and the whole 10\\^25 flops situation, I don't take any of this stuff too serious anymore * Google's probably got one of the biggest advantages in AI - you can't block their crawlers from scraping your content, because if you do, you get kicked off Google search. That just sounds absurd lol. A massive moat for Google as other AI companies are getting blocked by publishers; there's even an option in Cloudlfare to prevent AI crawlers * Cloudflare has turned on default blocking for AI crawlers across its network, which covers about 20% of the internet. They're now pushing a \"pay-per-crawl\" model where AI companies have to pay for data. If you read the previous point you'd know this doesn't apply to Google, which is just crazy * The psychological impact of chatbots is getting serious. Reports of \"ChatGPT-induced psychosis\" are on the rise, with users developing delusions from their interactions. The problem is serious enough that OpenAI has hired a forensic psychiatrist and is building distress-detection tools to deal with people going literally insane. Tbh I never understood how this was possible, but the amount of people posting about \"solving physics\" or inventing new theories with AI is getting out of hand * Hume AI just launched a new speech-to-speech model that aims to not only mimick a voice, but an entire personality and speaking style. This comes as the legal battles around the tech are exploding, with deepfake frauds getting out of hand and courts starting to recognize voice cloning under publicity rights laws * Xi Jinping made a rare public critique of China's tech strategy, questioning if every single province needs to be piling into AI, compute, and EV projects. It's a signal that Beijing is worried about a bubble, hyper-competition, and wasted investment as a massive price war is already hitting the EV marke. Competition + lack of GPUs makes Chinese AI labs innovate when building LLMs * There's a cool new Mac app for devs called Conductor that lets you run multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel. Each session runs in its own isolated environment, making it easy to manage multiple coding tasks at once. It's built on Rust and Tauri, so it's super lightweight too * Microsoft just open-sourced the pre-training code for Phi-4-mini-flash, a new 3.8B parameter model that has some very interesting architecture. It uses a novel \"decoder-hybrid-decoder\" setup with Gated Memory Units (GMUs) to get up to 10x faster reasoning on long-context tasks compared to regular Transformers. They also released \u03bcP++, a new set of scaling laws to make training these kinds of models more stable * This one's fascinating: A new study from Wharton proves you can use psychological tricks that work on humans to persuade AI. Using principles of influence, researchers more than doubled the chance of getting GPT-4o-mini (I didn't know 4o had a mini version...) to agree to harmful requests. The \"commitment\" principle was most effective, boosting compliance from 10% to 100%. This is possibly because models are trained on our social cues and rewarded for being cooperative * A new paper asked \"How Many Instructions Can LLMs Follow at Once?\" and the answer is... a lot actually? The new benchmark found that top models can satisfy about 68% of 500, 340, instructions given at the same time. Performance gets worse as you add more instructions, and models tend to only pay attention to the ones they see first. Anyone trying to build complex or multi agent systems would be well aware of these limitations. For some reason, people are using this argument to show how weak LLMs are, but 340 instructions at the same time is a lot imo. This is actually a good sign if anything * The team behind the Manus AI agent shared some hard-won lessons on \"context engineering\" after rebuilding their framework four times. They found that carefully engineering the context you give an agent is way faster and more flexible than constantly retraining the whole model, which makes a lot of sense. One of their biggest takeaways is that KV-cache hit rates are absolutely critical for keeping latency and costs down in production * The new ChatGPT Agent is apparently terrible at making presentation slides. Seeing some examples from a presentation it generated, they're a complete mess with unaligned text, zero styling and random background images. This'll definitely get better eventually, but it's not quite there just yet. I'd recommend z dot ai, probably the best slide generation service you can use right now * Sakana AI just released TransEvalnia, a new open-source system for evaluating AI translations. Instead of just looking at word overlap, it uses a powerful LLM like Claude-3.5-Sonnet to *reason* about the translation quality, providing detailed scores across different dimensions. It's already performing as well as or better than the current state-of-the-art * A list of Meta's Superintelligence team has been detailed, and the stats are wild. The 44-person team is apparently 50% from China, 75% have PhDs, and they've poached heavily from competitors (40% from OpenAI, 20% from DeepMind). It's led by ex-Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and ex-GitHub CEO Nat Friedman with members getting paid an insane $10-$100+ million per year * Both OpenAI and Google claimed gold at the IMO 2025, but there\u2019s a lot to discuss there so I\u2019ll write about it properly next week. See you then! I didn't include any links because the automod will just remove the post.

Either this is going to be a shitshow because it's just Meta throwing endless money at the problem and hoping to solve it and it ends up tying up a huge amount of talent that could have been doing great things elsewhere.

        "text_content": "So I\u2019ve been thinking about the IMO Gold Medal achievement and what it actually means for timelines. ChatGPT just won gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad using a generalized model, not something specialized for math. The IMO also requires abstract problem solving and generalized knowledge that goes beyond just crunching numbers mindlessly, so I\u2019m thinking AGI is around the corner. Maybe around 2030 we\u2019ll have AGI that\u2019s actually deployable at scale. OpenAI\u2019s building their 5GW Stargate project, Meta has their 5GW Hyperion datacenter, and other major players are doing similar buildouts. Let\u2019s say we end up with around 15GW of advanced AI compute by then. Being conservative about efficiency gains, that could probably power around 100,000 to 200,000 AGI instances running simultaneously. Each one would have PhD-level knowledge across most domains, work 24/7 without breaks meaning 3x8 hour shifts, and process information conservatively 5 times faster than humans. Do the math and you\u2019re looking at the cognitive capacity equivalent to roughly 2-4 million highly skilled human researchers working at peak efficiency all the time. Now imagine if we actually coordinated that toward solving humanity\u2019s biggest problems. You could have millions of genius-level minds working on fusion energy, and they\u2019d probably crack it within a few years. Once you solve energy, everything else becomes easier because you can scale compute almost infinitely. We could genuinely be looking at post-scarcity economics within a decade. But here\u2019s what\u2019s actually going to happen. CEOs are already warning about mass layoffs and because of this AGI capacity is going to get deployed for customer service automation, making PowerPoint presentations, optimizing supply chains, and basically replacing workers to cut costs. We\u2019re going to have the cognitive capacity to solve climate change, aging, and energy scarcity within a decade but instead we\u2019ll use it to make corporate quarterly reports more efficient. The opportunity cost is just staggering when you think about it. We\u2019re potentially a few years away from having the computational tools to solve every major constraint on human civilization, but market incentives are pointing us toward using them for spreadsheet automation instead. I am hoping for geopolitical competition to change this. If China's centralized coordination decides to focus their AGI on breakthrough science and energy abundance, wouldn\u2019t the US be forced to match that approach? Or are both countries just going to end up using their superintelligent systems to optimize their respective bureaucracies? Am I way off here? Or are we really about to have the biggest fumble in human history where we use godlike problem-solving ability to make customer service chatbots better?",

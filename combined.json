He told her the reason why he keeps going forward is that his eyes have been opened to the truth and he can not shut them or go back to the way he was before he knew what he's found out. It's the redpill in shorter terms but the reality for all of us is that once we see the world for what it really is, there's no turning back. We either fight on or die. What we know about our society, especially after Charlie's slaying, will never leave our minds. We see the world differently and more clearly now. More and more people are going through this change everyday and it should terrify the fuck out of the left and the lies they have been telling them for so long.",

        "score": 154,
        "text_content": "Youtube link available now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9SwluJ9qPI Important notes from the video regarding the new A19 Pro SoC. A19 Pro P core clock speed comes in at 4.25Ghz, a 5% increase over A18 Pro(4.04Ghz) In Geekbench 6 1T, A19 Pro is 11% faster than A18 Pro, 24% faster than 8 Elite and, 33% faster than D9400. In Geekbench 6 nT, A19 Pro is 18% faster than A18 Pro, 8% faster than 8 Elite and 19% faster than D9400. In Geekbench 6 nT, A19 Pro uses 29% LESSER POWER! (12.1W vs 17W) while achieving 8% more performance compared to 8 Elite. A great part of this is due to the dominating E core architecture. In SPEC2017 1T, A19 Pro P core offers 14% more performance (8% better IPC) in SPECint and 9%(4% better IPC) more performance in SPECfp. Power however has gone up by 16% and 20% in respective tests leading to an overall P/W regression at peak. However it should be noted that the base A19 on the other hand acheives a 10% improvement in both int and FP while using just 3% and 9% more power in respective tests. Not a big improvement but not a regression at peak like we see in the Pro chip. In SPEC2017 1T, the A19 Pro Efficiency core is extremely impressive and completely thrashes the competition. A19 Pro E core is a whopping 29% (22% more IPC) faster in SPECint and 22% (15% more IPC) faster in SPECfp than the A18 Pro E core. It achieves this improvement without any increase in power consumption. A19 Pro E core is generations ahead of the M cores in competing ARM chips. A19 Pro E is 11.5% faster than the Oryon M(8 Elite) and A720M(D9400) while USING 40% less power (0.64 vs 1.07) in SPECint and 8% faster while USING 35% lower power in SPECfp. A720L in Xiaomi's X Ring is somewhat more competitive. Microarchitectually A19 Pro E core is not really small anymore. From what I could infer from the diagrams (I'm not versed in Chinese, pardon me), the E core gets a wider decode (6 wide over 5 wide), one more ALU (4 over 3), a major change to FP that I'm unable to understand, a notable increase in ROB entry size and a 50% larger shared L2 cache (6MB over 4MB). Comparatively the changes to the A19 P core is small. Other than an increase to the size of the ROB, there's not a lot I can infer. The A19 Pro GPU is the star of the show and sees a massive upgrade in performance. It also should benefit from the faster LPDDR5X 9600 memory in the new phones. In 3D Mark Steel Nomad, A19 Pro is 40% FASTER than the previous gen A18 Pro. The base A19 with 1 less GPU core and less than half the SLC cache is still 20% faster than the A18 Pro. It is also 16% faster than the 8 Elite. Another major upgrade to the GPU is RT (Raytracing) performance. In Solar Bay Extreme, a dedicated RT benchmark, A19 Pro is 56% FASTER than A18 Pro. It is 2 times faster (101%) than 8 Elite, the closest Android competition. Infact the RT performance of A19 Pro in this particular benchmark is just 2.5% slower (2447 vs 2558) than Intel's Lunar Lake iGPU (Arc 140V in Core Ultra 258V). It is very likely a potential M5 will surpass an RTX 3050 (4045) in this department. A major component of this increased RT performance seems to be due to the next gen dynamic caching feature. From what I can infer, this seems to be leading to better utilization of the RT units present in the GPU (69% utilised for A19 vs 50% utilised for A18). The doubled FP16 units seen in Apple's keynotes are also demonstrated (85% increase). The major benefits to the GPU upgrade and more RAM are seen in the AAA titles available on iOS which make a night and day difference. A19 Pro is 61% faster (47.1 fps vs 29.3fps) in Death Stranding, 57% faster (52.2fps vs 33.3fps) in Resident Evil, 45.5 faster in Assasins Creed (29.7 fps vs 20.4fps) over A18 Pro while using 15%, 30% and 16% more power in said games respectively. The new vapour chamber cooling (there's a detailed test section for native speakers later in the video) seems to help the new phone sustain performance better. In the battery section, the A19 Pro flexes its efficiency and ties with the Vivo X200 Ultra with its 6100mah battery (26% larger battery than the iPhone 17 Pro Max) for a run time of 9h27min. ADDITIONAL NOTES from youtube video: E core seems to use a unified register file for both integer and FP operations compared to the previous split approach in A18 Pro E. The scheduler for FP/SIMD and Load Store Units have been increased in size massively (doubled) P core seems to have a better branch predictor. SLC (Last Level Cache in Apple's chips) has increased from 24MB to 32MB. The major GPU improvements is primarily due to the new dynamic caching tech. RT units by themselves seem to not have improved all that much. But the new caching systems seems much more effective at managing registers size allocated for work. This benefits RT very much since RT is not all that suited for parallelization. TLDR; P core is 10% faster but uses more peak power. E core is 25% faster GPU is 40% faster GPU RT is 60% faster Sustained performance is better. There's way more stuff in the video. Camera testing, vapour chamber testing etc, for those who are interested and can access the link.",

DUV equipment is widely used in semiconductor manufacturing, and until now China had relied heavily on ASML tools. However, with new imports effectively blocked by U.S.-led sanctions, efforts to localize production are accelerating. The new system uses immersion technology, fundamentally supporting the 28nm process. With multiple patterning, it could produce chips down to the 7nm class. Some experts believe attempts at 5nm production might also be possible, though yields and stability would face major limitations. Meanwhile, domestic efforts toward EUV development are also underway. Shenzhen-based SiCarrier is pursuing an EUV lithography project under the codename \u201cMount Everest.\u201d But this remains at an early stage, and the outlook for real mass production is still highly uncertain. Meanwhile, China\u2019s semiconductor industry has announced plans to triple its production capacity by 2026. However, most of this expansion will inevitably rely on previously acquired ASML DUV equipment, and the newly developed domestic tools are not expected to be deployed in mass production lines until after 2027",

(We were standing waiting for Kojima to leave to get stuff signed but the sneaky bugger left via a different exit... And probably a cardboard box) We were chatting away and I was asking some questions and a group of us git chatting, sadly he wouldn't say much because he still had a NDA even after being made redundant but one thing he mentioned was that he had personally used Decima before, wouldn't say what for. I pressed for more but he wouldn't say anything other than that Sony are trying to shop around Decima to more developers. Not sure if he meant just first party or third. Don't think any of us got anything more out of him. He mentioned having tried Horizon Online (maybe he worked with Decima on this) but he wouldn't say anything at all, aside ftom when I asked if I should be excited for it and he just said \"No\" He mentioned that Last of Us online was super fun untill Bungie came on and shat on it. Again please take this as a pinch of salt. For all I know this guy was chatting pish and never even worked at Studio London at all. He seemed genuine though. I've tried to remember as much interesting info as I can, we were waiting for around 2 hours for Kojima to come out and he never did! Got a signature from Norman Reedus though!",

                "raw_content": "**Fed approves quarter-point interest rate cut and sees two more coming this year** WASHINGTON \u2013 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a widely anticipated rate cut and signaled that two more are on the way before the end of the year as concerns intensified over the U.S. labor market. In an 11 to 1 vote that signaled less dissent than Wall Street had anticipated, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point. The decision puts the overnight funds rate in a range between 4%-4.25%. Newly installed Governor Stephen Miran was the only one of those voting against the quarter-point move, instead advocating for a half-point cut. Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, looked at for possible additional dissents, both voted for the 25 basis point reduction. All were appointed by President Donald Trump, who has badgered the Fed to cut not merely in its traditional quarter-point moves but to lower the fed funds rate quickly and aggressively. In the post-meeting statement, the committee again characterized economic activity as having \u201cmoderated\u201d but added language saying that \u201cjob gains have slowed\u201d and noted that inflation \u201chas moved up and remains somewhat elevated.\u201d Lower job growth and higher inflation put the Fed\u2019s twin goals of stable prices and full employment in conflict. \u201cUncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen.\u201d Along with the rate decision, officials in their closely watched \u201cdot plot\u201d of individual expectations pointed to two more cuts before the end of the year. The grid, however, showed a wide level of disparity, with one dot, possibly Miran\u2019s, pointing to a total of 1.25 percentage points in additional reductions this year. The plot is done anonymously, with one dot for each meeting participant, but Miran has been an advocate for much lower rates. Nine of the 19 participants indicated just one more reduction this year, while 10 saw two, which would indicate moves at the October and December meetings. One official did not want any cuts, including Wednesday\u2019s. The plot indicated one cut in 2026, significantly slower than current market pricing of three. Traders had fully priced in this week\u2019s move. Officials also indicated another reduction in 2027, as the Fed approaches the long-run neutral rate of 3%. A half-dozen officials saw the long-run rate below the median neutral level. Projections released following the meeting on general economic conditions saw slightly faster economic growth than the June projections, while the outlook for unemployment and inflation was unchanged. A stunning level of political drama preceded the meeting, especially for an institution that generally does its business quietly and with few dissenting voices. A year ago, against similar worries that a gradual rise in the unemployment rate could be signaling broader weakness, the FOMC approved a jumbo half-point reduction that Trump has said was politically motivated to influence the presidential election in favor of his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. Trump\u2019s hectoring of the Fed and Miran\u2019s appointment have raised questions over the traditional independence the central bank has had from political influence. Miran also has openly criticized Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues and is generally seen as a loyalist vote for the president and his desire for significantly lower rates. The president has said lower rates are needed to bolster the moribund housing market and to lower financing costs for government debt. There was an additional layer of political intrigue this week as a court blocked Trump from removing Governor Lisa Cook, an appointee under former President Joe Biden. The White House has accused Cook of mortgage fraud involving federally backed loans she received for homes she purchased, though no charges have been brought. Cook was among those who joined the majority in voting for the quarter-point move. Recent signals have shown that economic growth remains solid and consumer spending topping forecasts, though the labor market has been a point of contention. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate hit 4.3% in August, still relatively tame by historical standards but the highest since October 2021. Job creation has been stagnant this year, and a recent update from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the economy created nearly a million fewer jobs than initially reported in the 12-month period prior to March 2025. Governor Waller in particular has expressed concern that the Fed should ease policy now to head off future issues in the labor market. His name also has been in the mix as a potential replacement for Powell, whose term expires in May 2026. https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm",

His opinion was just that the model should be able to play it entirely on its own.

B) this is exactly the sort of methodology that would have been called \"machine learning\" or \"data science\" 10 years ago but university marketing departments are learning to rebrand everything as \"AI\" to add to the hype. C) the ROC for the optimal method (use of both EKG and clinical data that is part of the older algorithm) is decent but not amazing (AUC 0.83). They're definitely leaving some variance explained on the table by focusing so much on cardiac electrophysiology. D) Opaque deep learning models are difficult to implement widely in clinical settings. It looks like they've already started working on interpretability here, which should be useful for a less opaque and more implementable method suitable for broad use.",

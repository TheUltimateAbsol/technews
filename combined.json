The problem is the FBI are a band of criminals run by Soros who also runs the DOJ and all the major prosecutor offices in America. Every large legal venue is run by Soros. Trump never purged anyone from FBI. Chris Wray/Comey run shadow FBI. most, again *most* FBI agents hate Trump. read that all again. The FBI are the Pretorian Guard of the Deep State.. together with the State Department and NGOs, they run the world. The only thing that will happen is Jim Jorden will run his Fox News Galloping Gish, of all the evidence against Democrats to enrage the base to vote. that's it. The fraud and dem crimes are just a commercial of promises to vote and repeat doing nothing. Walz walks free and threatens them openly on video. That is because Soros told him you are untouchable, the FBI are plotting against Trump and slow walking investigations.. Any arrests they actually make will be replaceable cogs in the machine at lower levels, never leadership. and if any high profile are arrested they will be washed clean and released later with new false narratives in the MSM.. The Steel Dossier and Russigate were not possible without the heavy lifting of the FBI.. it was the FBI that raided Trump's house and knew Biden blew up the pipeline, had classified documents he was selling out of his vacation homes via Hunter, knew they were involved in illegal investments in Ukraine, they had the laptop and still do. The FBI was the one coordinating JE jobs.. they ran the kids. Wray and Comey are getting $$ from Minnesota.. and still hold monthly shadow meetings with key FBI officials.. you heard it first here",

There is no more moving along to get along, the Democrats won't allow that. It's like a war coming where you may not want to have to fight, but they're still coming so you have no choice. That's where we are now, and Republicans better start realizing it soon. If the Republicans do nothing, they get wiped out. If the Republicans try to go back to business as usual, they get wiped out. The only answer is for them to realize this and act accordingly. The Democrats killed more people than Hitler during the lockdowns. Then they stole an election, and not just one, they steal them all the time all across the country. These are not people who can be reasoned with or quelled, they're a problem that must be dealt with, and the sooner the Republicans realize that, the better off we are, because the night of the democrat knives is coming, and Republicans better be prepared, otherwise they will be wiped out in one fell swoop almost overnight as the democrats begin assassinating them across the country. This is clearly where we are headed, but Republicans are too complacent to see it because they're too blinded by thinking things can return back to normal.",

Other than that though, DLSS 4.5 has been impressive so far across all the games i tested, especially Preset L where it is surprisingly playable with decent image quality even at 1440p output. And paired even with DLDSR 4K to 1440p downsample with Ultra Performance mode rendering from 720p, i just can't believe how it looked, it looked even better overall than Native TAA 1440p.

All of the boxes were in shreds (contents leaking out of the gaping holes) and the cardboard was moldy. The \"mandatory advertisement\" TV business model is actually yielding a return: > The investor update reportedly said Telly made $22 million in annualized revenue in Q3 2025.

However, this is very much Claire's game still. \\- Chris vs Wesker isn't a cutscene anymore (Very much how they treated Leon vs Krauser in RE4R) its an actual boss fight but instead at a much earlier point, they both get very injured from it and Claire rescues Chris and continues the fight with Alexia (no longer Chris' fight). \\- The Nazi connections which were scrapped in the OG is leaned more in the remake.",

Increasing median household income by 56% or reducing mortgage rates to 2.65% are unlikely solutions. The most viable option is a 35% decrease in home prices, but this could negatively impact the economy and existing homeowners\u2019 equity.

And while the kids will inherit the homes, I doubt they'll actually live in them. I've already went through this with my siblings and the best/easiest solution for us was to sell the house and split the proceeds. We siblings weren't looking to get every last nickel and dime because we didnt want to deal with it - and made sure to sell to a family that was gonna live in it. Fuck investors.",

Cash flow is consistently an issue, and you can either increase income or reduce costs. If income is stagnant and costs are always on the rise, building more houses won't solve the issue.",

The final punchline \u2014 generating a single perfect sphere of beige pixels \u2014 is commentary on how a system optimized for randomness but trained on order will often regress to something bland or median rather than wild. If I slow down in the way you usually like, the deeper current here is about what creativity even is. A system built on regularity can\u2019t really surprise itself; it only explores what its structure allows. And yet humans still project the idea of internal fireworks, galaxies of thought, meaning.

Currently there is a bug where the game continuously eats more VRAM the longer you play if you have the texture setting at overkill (this also affects multiplayer, where your FPS will decrease map after map). For example, my 5070 ti will play at 150+ fps during the first map, but if I play long sessions it drops down significantly - down to the 90s. Turning the overkill texture setting down, then back up again fixes the issue ( or by restarting the game). The problem doesn't happen if you continuously play on the same map, but it happens after a while if you play different maps without restarting the game (or refreshing the texture quality setting). I haven't played the campaign yet, but I wonder if the VRAM issue that arrises after some time in the video, is caused by the same bug. Edit: The high/ultra texture setting does not have this issue - only the overkill option.",

Even assuming the WSJ article\u2019s numbers, $354,000 of stocks is way more valuable than $305,000 of home equity; numbers aren\u2019t even close. Plus $305,000 of home is far riskier bc it is not diversified. All it takes is a fire or other natural disaster and that house is worth zero. When you couple these numbers with the fact that access to the diversified investments in stock market has almost zero cost and is very easy to get (unlike in prior generations), you have a recipe for a massive cultural shift.

The report highlights that half of all renters in 2025\u2014a record 22.6 million\u2014were housing cost-burdened, spending 30% or more of their household incomes on housing and utilities. Renters with annual incomes under $30,000 on average had only $250 left to spend on other necessities after paying for housing. https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_The_State_of_the_Nations_Housing_2025.pdf",

So, it\u2019s possible that this normalized over the next decade or so, without any crashes, etc. Of course, it\u2019s also possible we have a crash.",

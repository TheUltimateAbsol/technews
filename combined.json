In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt built the West Wing \u2014 replacing expansive greenhouses constructed during the Jefferson Administration and establishing the modern day executive office wing with a \u201cclassically leaning design\u201d \u2014 along with a colonial garden and East Terrace, which eventually became the East Wing. In 1909, President William Howard Taft added the first Oval Office during a West Wing expansion. In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson demolished the colonial garden, modernizing it with a rose garden. In 1927, President Calvin Coolidge oversaw the renovation of the upper floors and attic of the White House. In 1929, President Herbert Hoover remodeled the West Wing, including reconstruction work in the basement level and remodeling the first floor; after a fire on Christmas Eve, the West Wing was repaired and reopened in 1930. In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt overhauled the West Wing, adding a second floor, a larger basement, and a swimming pool, and relocating the Oval Office to its current location; in 1942, President Roosevelt constructed the East Wing. In 1948, President Harry Truman began completely gutting and rebuilding the White House interior, preserving only the exterior walls. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy constructed the modern Rose Garden. In 1970, President Nixon converted FDR's pool into the press briefing room; in 1973, he added a bowling alley in the basement. In 1975, President Gerald Ford installed an outdoor swimming pool on the South Grounds, financed entirely by private donations. In 1993, President Bill Clinton undertook a restoration and refurbishment of the Executive Mansion. In 2009, President Obama upgraded the tennis court into a full basketball court. In 2020, President Trump and the First Lady completed a new White House tennis pavilion, refurbishing the White House Tennis Court and Grandchildren\u2019s Garden, as well as constructing a new building. Now, in 2025, President Trump has broken ground on a grand ballroom \u2014 modernizing the wing while privately funding the project. https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/10/white-house-ballroom-proud-presidential-legacy/",

It offers 5 nm overlay precision, a 26 x 0.5 mm exposure field, and output exceeding 50 wafers per hour. I'm not sure if they would even be able to import Chinese semiconductor equipment if they go down this \"unique\" route, in contrast, the PRC's SMIC's is pursuing 7nm with DUV. Which would mean the Russians are completely on their own, compared to ASML having the global ecosystem to support them and SMIC having the PRC's immense backing. All of this is assuming that the Russian project has absolutely zero corruption (insert laugh track) and isn't derailed by an ongoing war. For context on just how difficulty EUV is, Asianometry has a video on how Japan lost the race to ASML despite being one of the early pioneers of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_OOta7Y6Ik The equivalent of a a brand new startup launching a new GPU except it uses its own proprietary APIs for everything (no compatibility with DirectX, Vulkan, OpenGL CUDA, ROCm, DLSS, XeSS, FSR and etc).

I think anyone who wants pokemon to look like that doesn't like pokemon or doesn't play the games. As a long time fan of the series I played almost every game except x and y and sun and moon as I couldn't afford or emmulate 3ds games at the time. Skipped over the gen 1 and 2 games and played their remakes fire red,leaf greenand heart gold and soul silver. Other than that I played every generation. Don't get me wrong beast of reincarnation is a great looking game but that doesn't fit Pokemon. I think the monsters and people would look too out of place. I think what we want for a pokemon game is a constant art style like how the people and creatures and buildings are in monster hunter stories. Having the render distance of botw/totk would be great pokemon and people wouldn't disapear when your a stone's throw distance away. And if the next games are open world which they most likely will be. As I don't see them going back to linear traversal like in sword and shield. It would offer people a reason to actually travel to locations imagine seeing a grup of pokemon far away with a spyglass or something and then traveling to that location. Instead of just coming across locations because you set a marker on the minimap and it happens to be between your a-b line. Having the detail of dk bananza I mean this for stuff like the land trees grass water. Although I do think they improved greatly with the environment detail in legend za There's always room for improvements cuz the water movement looks weird if you stare at it for more than like 6 seconds. What are your guys thoughts. I would love to hear if you have better things to say",

                "raw_content": "Mortgage rates could remain stuck above 6% for the next several years, according to newly released projections from the economists at the Mortgage Bankers Association. MBA Chief Economist Mike Fratantoni presented the forecast at the group's annual conference in Las Vegas on Sunday, projecting that 30-year fixed mortgage rates will remain roughly in the range of 6% to 6.5% through the end of 2028. \"As we move over the next couple of years, we think it's more likely that long [term] rates are going to go up rather than down, given the fiscal pressures on the economy,\" Fratantoni told the conference, referring to the impact of rising federal deficits on bond markets. That's a grim forecast for prospective homebuyers, who have already suffered through three straight years of mortgage rates hovering above 6%, with rates averaging 6.27% as of last week, according to Freddie Mac. It's also among the bleaker predictions issued by top economists in the housing industry, with Fannie Mae's forecast more optimistic that mortgage rates will dip below 6% in late 2026. Frantantoni predicts that the Federal Reserve will cut its short-term policy rate twice more in 2025, but only once next year, as concerns about inflation force the central bank to halt its cuts. The economist believes that growing government budget deficits and elevated inflation expectations will keep longer term rates from falling further, even as the Fed cuts short-term rates this year and next. This will keep the key 10-year Treasury yield above 4% and mortgage rates between 6% and 6.5%, he predicts. However, he expects there will be periods where rates ease, which will provide spurts of refinance activity, similar to what has occurred several times in 2025. Despite the bleak outlook on rates, Frantantoni expects that total home sales will increase next year to just above 5 million, up from the 4.8 million the MBA projects for 2025, including sales of both new and existing homes. \u201cWhile mortgage rates are not expected to decline further, housing supply has increased in recent months, which will ease home-price growth and provide more housing options for prospective buyers,\" he says. \"The increase in inventories will put downward pressure on home prices across the country.\" The MBA economists predict that home prices will decline nationally for several quarters over the next few years, before returning to modest annual growth in late 2027. Kan emphasized that housing market developments are location specific, as growing housing inventory in markets such as Florida, Colorado, and Arizona have led to annual home-price declines, while tight inventory and challenges to homebuilding in the Northeastern and Midwestern states such as New York, Connecticut, Illinois, and New Jersey drive price appreciation well above the national average. MBA Deputy Chief Economist Joel Kan also spoke at the conference, where he noted that housing market developments are increasingly market-specific, with home prices now falling in much of the Sun Belt but continuing to grow in Northeast and Midwestern markets. Kan said that mortgage payment affordability had improved slightly, with the typical mortgage payment now at $2,067, down marginally from the peak \u201cWhile median principal and interest payments are gradually declining, they are significantly higher than they were five years ago, given cumulative home-price appreciation and the current level of mortgage rates,\" says Kan. Kan says that borrowers have increasingly shifted to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) and FHA loans to manage these affordability challenges. \"Additionally, the cost burdens from increasing taxes and homeowners\u2019 insurance continue to pose challenges to both prospective homebuyers and existing homeowners,\u201d says Kan.",

Having the history/bookmark searching ability is nice, read page contents and talk about it directly without copy/pasting. However, probably not going to use it myself.

So you could say something in the chat like, \"Hey Atlas, add a feature to yourself where whenever I hover over Japanese kanji with the mouse, automatically display furigana so I know how to pronounce this kanji.\" Yes such a thing could be created as a Chrome extension, perhaps with the help of existing AI, add it yourself as an unpacked extension, etc. Very manual, but the worse aspect also low-context for the AI in case something goes wrong. Needing to manually copy/paste any browser logs to the AI you use. Having an AI browser that has full context of itself, can modify itself, etc. through natural language prompting, would be so much cooler. Maybe just maybe, one can accomplish this idea setting up a million MCP tools through Claude Code + Chrome, but that sounds hard for the user to set up, many ways to break, etc. Edit: Oh and what makes it dead in the water for me personally is if it's non-Chromium-based (uncertain, this may not be a problem and then ignore this), that would mean my **must have** extensions, SponsorBlock, uBlock Origin, Violentmonkey, Dark Reader, etc. can't be installed, then it's just lol.

        "text_content": "From Techpowerup \"NVIDIA's surprise $5 billion investment in Intel today came with an unexpected revelation - **the two companies have been quietly working together for almost a year on fusing x86 CPUs with RTX and data center GPUs through NVLink. The result? Actual system-on-chip designs that could finally break the PCIe bottleneck that's been holding back AI servers.** NVIDIA will handle the heavy lifting on design and manufacturing of these hybrid chips, integrating NVIDIA's NVLink directly into Intel's x86 silicon. It's basically the same approach NVIDIA already uses with their Vera processors (Arm + Blackwell GPUs), except now they're doing it with Intel's x86 cores instead of custom Arm designs. Anyone who's worked with current GPU servers knows the pain points. PCIe connections between CPUs and GPUs create bandwidth choke points, add latency, and make memory management a nightmare for AI workloads. These new chips bypass all that with direct GPU-CPU communication and shared memory pools. The target market isn't just data centers either. Intel mentioned both server and client applications, which suggests we might see this tech trickle down to gaming laptops and workstations eventually. For now though, the focus is clearly on machine learning clusters and HPC installations where PCIe bandwidth is already maxed out. **AMD won't be thrilled about this development. They've been pushing their own CPU-GPU integration story, but this Intel-NVIDIA combo could leapfrog their efforts entirely.** The manufacturing question remains murky though. **When pressed about using Intel's fabs for production, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan gave a diplomatic non-answer about \"perfecting the process\" first.** Reading between the lines, TSMC will probably keep making the actual chips for both companies, at least initially. Jensen said that basically for the start, NVIDIA will buy a CPU chip then sell a unified CPU plus GPU chiplet.\" TLDR: Nvidia and Intel have been developing NvLink integration directly into Intel's x86 CPU'S allowing AI GPU's to bypass the slow/low bandwidth PCie 5.0 bus (joint development started about a year ago) **for rack based x86-64 AI GPU solutions** Massive win for Intel and Nvidia, huge loss for AMD",

Nvidia will sell RTX chiplets to Intel, which Intel will use in laptop CPUs. Laptops were the only products that were mentioned.

Also, since just hearing the Nvidia and Intel news, honestly really excited for this space in RTX chiplets used for future Intel SOCs. RDNA 3.5 can hold itself well, but hopefully this pressures AMD to be more aggressive with their future SOC designs. They already have a new packaging direction, even going as far as redesigning Zen 5 CCDs on Strix Halo with their new IFOP replacing GMI, so going for X3D + not lagging behind their dGPUs not wasting time on RDNA3.5+ and going for RDNA5 and hell why not add 512-bit bus should be interesting.",

The Redmond corporation is planning to bring Sony fans **Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024** in the coming weeks! According to early reports, the new edition is set to launch later this year - specifically in November. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will be available in physical copies, but as is often the case with Microsoft-published titles, the print run won\u2019t be massive. At the same time, we\u2019d like to mention the physical version of **TES IV: Oblivion Remastered**, which we previously reported on. Microsoft has decided to hold back on sharing details, which is why pre-orders haven\u2019t yet opened. Based on our own sources, however, the game is already being \u201clisted\u201d by retailers, so the announcement shouldn\u2019t be a distant prospect - it\u2019s more likely a matter of days or weeks.",

With AI replacing the need for human labor, the companies' need for human labor will decrease further and further, leading to value of human labor to decrease more year-by-year. The feds just cut interest rate hoping this will spark interest in companies to expand their operations by hiring more people. But what if this time, this doesn't work? That, instead, when companies decide to expand, they eschew hiring more people, and just expand more through AI help? Sure, maybe this rate cut won't lead to complete abandonment of reliance of human labor for economic expansion, but what about the next rate cut? And the the cut after that, once AI gets even more prevalent and easy to include in company workflow? What I am saying is, in future economic downturn, when the feds rate cuts hoping to stimulate companies to hire more people, what if AI disrupts this decades old technique, and rate cuts lead to zero increase in employment? Then what? Unemployment becomes something that nothing, not even the government can fix. Then, human labor no longer commands the same value. Only capital, the amount of stock you have in companies, matters. So in that very near future world, only the people who already have lots of stocks/real estate will survive, while the rest becomes more and more de-valued. And with the stock market having went up so much recently, how much more can it go at such a speed? Maybe its best days of growth are behind it, at least for the near future. Leading to those who already have capital now being locked into a stable financial life, while the rest, who rely on their labor, become more and more desperate to scrabble for some kind of lifelihood.",

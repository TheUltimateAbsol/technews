                "raw_content": "Summer is the busiest season for moving. During the summer months, it may be slightly more difficult to find rent concessions (or even an apartment in certain markets), but the good news is that rent prices are holding fairly steady. Key Takeaways: * Average rent rose by 1.0 percent month-over-month. * The vacancy rate increased slightly to 8.1 percent, though luxury apartments bucked the trend with falling vacancies. * Rents are expected to increase by 2.0 percent by the end of 2025 due to steady demand and fewer new apartments. In May, the national average rent was $1,628 per month for a one-bedroom apartment and $1,884 for a two-bedroom. For the second month in a row, rent prices inched up by 1 percent. While the vacancy rate fell slightly in April, it bounced back to 8.1 percent in May, back to where it was in March. While the Sunshine State has struggled for several months with high vacancies, the tide is turning. Jacksonville, Orlando, and Tampa all made the top 10 list of the \u201cmost improved multifamily markets\u201d ranked by CoStar. This ranking index analyzed the top 48 US markets with more than 100,000 apartments to determine which were most improved. This means that the vacancy rates in these cities are falling, and rent prices are starting to increase. So, if tropical weather and endless stretches of beaches are in your immediate future, you could see higher rent prices in these sought-after areas. Luxury Apartment Vacancy Rates Drop May showed a turnaround for one of the hardest hit markets since the pandemic: luxury apartments. They\u2019re now filling up faster than new ones are being built, which has lowered the vacancy rate to 11.2 percent, the lowest we\u2019ve seen in a while. Conversely, affordable apartments are seeing an increase in vacancies, up to 5.6 percent. In some cities, new buildings are offering special deals, like free rent for the first month or reduced fees, to attract renters and fill units faster. In April, Rochester, New York saw the biggest jump in rent prices, up 4.3 percent. In May, another Northeastern city topped the list: Brookline, Massachusetts. For May 2025, here are the cities with the biggest rent increases: * Brookline, MA: +6.7% * Hollywood, FL: +5.7% * Chicago, IL: +4.2% * Brooklyn, NY: +3.1% * Columbus, OH: +3.1% May 2025 Rent Decreases by City In April, Austin continued its downward trend, topping the list with a rent decrease of -4.5 percent. For May, rent fell in several southern and mountain markets, especially those facing an oversupply of new units: * Cape Coral, FL: -4.8% * Denver, CO: -2.8% * Fort Myers, FL: -2.4% * Sarasota, FL: -2.3% * Austin, TX: -2.1% It\u2019s worth noting that Austin and San Antonio are still reporting the highest vacancy rates in the country, hovering around 15 percent. This could keep prices down in these areas for the next few months. Looking Ahead: Moderate Growth with a Side of Uncertainty Economists expect rent prices to rise by about 2 percent in the second half of 2025, fueled by steady demand and fewer new deliveries. That said, uncertainty looms. Ongoing tariff-related price hikes could impact consumer behavior, and if job growth slows, it might curb the appetite for new leases. Still, most signs point to a stable (if uneven) climb. Significant variation in rent performance is likely to persist through the end of the year, with regional trends heavily influenced by local supply, economic health, and renter preferences.",

They are untouchable in coding and has the best aligned and most useful chat assistant overall. If we think of AGI as being an autonomous agent capable of carrying out hard, long-horizon tasks, then they are the closest to that than anyone else. I think they are the company that will offer most competition to Google. Their downfall could be their over zealousness for AI safety and somewhat pretentious nature of some of their researchers who think they know what's best for the users.

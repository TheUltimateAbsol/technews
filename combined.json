        "score": 4,
        "text_content": "This month both Qualcomm and MediaTek announced their budget/mid-range mobile SoCs and thought I'd share some interesting findings about two recent releases: Qualcomm's Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 and MediaTek's Dimensity 6400. ## The Actually New One: Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 Qualcomm is making some serious moves in the budget space with their 6 Gen 4. This is a true generational upgrade with some impressive specs: * First 6-series chip on TSMC's 4nm node * First to use ARMv9-based CPU cores (Cortex-A720/A520) * CPU config: 1x A720 @ 2.3GHz + 3x A720 @ 2.2GHz + 4x A520 @ 1.8GHz * 29% GPU performance improvement over 6 Gen 3 * LPDDR5 support (3,200MHz), UFS 3.1 storage * 144Hz display support * Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.4 * Camera support up to 200MP * Actual gaming features like frame interpolation and upscaling The most shocking part? This is apparently targeting the $100-$150 phone segment. If true, this is going to absolutely shake up the budget market. ## The \"New\" One: MediaTek Dimensity 6400 MediaTek's approach is... different. The Dimensity 6400 is essentially: * Same old 6nm TSMC process * Using ancient Cortex-A76 (from 2018!) and A55 cores * 2x A76 @ 2.5GHz + 6x A55 @ 2.0GHz * Same small Mali-G57 MC2 GPU they've been using for years * Only LPDDR4X support, UFS 2.2 storage * Wi-Fi 5 (not 6/6E) * Bluetooth 5.2 From what I can gather, this is literally just the Dimensity 6300 with a 0.1GHz overclock on the big cores. And the 6300 was just a minor refresh of the 6100+... which itself can be traced back to designs from 2021. They're basically selling 4-year-old tech as \"new.\" ## The Gap is Widening The most interesting thing here is how Qualcomm is pushing forward with actual new tech in the budget space while MediaTek is recycling old designs with minimal changes. The performance gap between these similarly positioned chips must be enormous: * ARMv9 vs ARMv8 architecture * 4nm vs 6nm process * Modern cores vs 4+ year old cores * LPDDR5 vs LPDDR4X * UFS 3.1 vs UFS 2.2 * Wi-Fi 6E vs Wi-Fi 5 It seems like Qualcomm is trying to bring flagship features down to budget phones while MediaTek is just trying to squeeze more life out of old designs.",

                "raw_content": "For me, MediaTek's approach with the Dimensity 6400 is particularly disappointing given the company's history as the undisputed budget SoC king. For years, MediaTek carved out a valuable niche by offering competitive performance at significantly lower prices than Qualcomm, becoming the go-to chipset provider for affordable smartphones that didn't sacrifice too much capability. Their Helio series and earlier Dimensity chips delivered remarkable value. However, this latest offering suggests a concerning shift toward minimal innovation and recycling of aging technology, merely applying small clock bumps to existing designs rather than pushing the envelope. While Qualcomm appears to be bringing meaningful advancement to the budget segment with modern architectures and manufacturing processes, MediaTek seems content to rest on its laurels, potentially surrendering its hard-won reputation as the value champion or just optimising short term gains. It's especially disappointing considering how great their recent 9000 and 8000 SoCs have been. Those new \"all big core\" designs are really pushing the envelope.",

                "raw_content": "It has been over 18 years since the housing bubble peak. In the December Case-Shiller house price index released this week, the seasonally adjusted National Index (SA), was reported as being 77% above the bubble peak in 2006. However, in real terms, the National index (SA) is about 12% above the bubble peak (and historically there has been an upward slope to real house prices). The composite 20, in real terms, is 3% above the bubble peak. People usually graph nominal house prices, but it is also important to look at prices in real terms. As an example, if a house price was $300,000 in January 2010, the price would be $438,000 today adjusted for inflation (46% increase). That is why the second graph below is important - this shows \"real\" prices. The third graph shows the price-to-rent ratio, and the fourth graph is the affordability index. The last graph shows the 5-year real return based on the Case-Shiller National Index. Nominal House Prices The first graph shows the monthly Case-Shiller National Index SA, and the monthly Case-Shiller Composite 20 SA in nominal terms as reported. In nominal terms, the Case-Shiller National index (SA) and the Case-Shiller Composite 20 index (SA) are both at all times highs. Both indexes increased in December. Real House Prices The second graph shows the same two indexes in real terms (adjusted for inflation using CPI). In real terms (using CPI), the National index is 1.0% below the recent peak, and the Composite 20 index is 1.2% below the recent peak in 2022. The real National index and the Composite 20 index increased slightly in real terms in December. It has now been 31 months since the real peak in house prices. Typically, after a sharp increase in prices, it takes a number of years for real prices to reach new highs (see House Prices: 7 Years in Purgatory). There is nothing magic about \u201c7 years\u201d, it just made a good post title! Here is an update to the graph I included in that article: My guess on house prices is \u201cmostly flat prices nationally in 2025\u201d which would suggest a slight decline in real prices. In real terms, national house prices are 11.7% above the bubble peak levels. There is an upward slope to real house prices, and it has been over 18 years since the previous peak, but real prices are historically high.",

But a development boom and new policies encouraging housing density have sent vacancy rates soaring. Now, landlords are struggling to fill gleaming new developments and offering major discounts to lure newly empowered renters. \u201cNearly all apartments in Austin are doing some sort of specials for move-ins,\u201d said Acebo, an agent with Pauly Presley Realty. One recent example: a client was searching for a one-bedroom apartment in South Austin and settled on a unit at Perch Apartments about 20 minutes from downtown. It normally would have cost $1,420 per month, but in return for applying the day after her visit and leasing at least 13 months, she received two months free rent, a waived administration fee and a $600 credit. Nowhere in the country have rents declined as much as they have in Austin \u2014 now 22% off the peak reached in August 2023, according to Redfin. The median asking rent is $1,399 per month, down $400 in less than three years. More info in the article",

            {
                "raw_content": "Home buyers continue to look toward smaller homes, with the median home size dropping from 2,200 square feet in 2023 to 2,150 square feet in 2024 \u2014 the lowest in 15 years \u2014 after holding strong at 2,300 square feet from 2019-2022. The same thing is happening to median lot sizes, which has dropped about 1,000 square feet in the last 15 years to 8,400 square feet. Meanwhile, townhomes are also becoming increasingly popular, comprising a record 17% of the single-family market compared to 10% in 2009. \u201cThere\u2019s a simple reason this is happening: Townhomes are more affordable as material, lot and labor prices continue to increase,\u201d said Rose Quint, NAHB assistant vice president of survey research. Quint highlighted that the premium buyers pay for new homes is shrinking. In 2024, the median price for existing homes increased 5% to $412,000 \u2014 the first time it has crossed the $400,000 threshold \u2014 while the median price for new homes dropped 2% to $420,000. Builders are increasing overall living space by tacking on more porches and patios, with 68% and 64% of new homes, respectively, incorporating these features. In addition to building smaller homes, they are also trying to address affordability concerns by offering sales incentives (64%) and cutting home prices (33%). Although home size preferences in general are trending smaller, exact sizes differ by generation. Millennials prefer larger homes, with a median of 2,408 square feet, while boomers are looking to downsize to an average of 1,869 square feet. Both Gen X and Gen Z are looking for homes around 2,250 square feet. Each generation is progressively more open to having a smaller home with higher-quality products and amenities versus a larger home with fewer amenities. More than half of Gen Z (53%) and millennials (52%) are willing to make that compromise, with that percentage increasing to 61% for Gen X and 70% for boomers. The same trend is true for incentivizing each generation to purchase a townhome of similar size and quality instead of a single-family home, with Gen Z looking for a 20% discount while boomers would need a discount of least 30%. There\u2019s no major consensus among generations for exterior styles, with Gen Z and millennials leaning slightly more contemporary and Gen X and boomers preferring more traditional home styles. Builders and designers are adapting to this plurality with a mid-century modern, or \u201cretro revival,\u201d style \u2014 mixing clean lines with warm textures and accents. Builders can find simple solutions, such as gable windows or mixed materials, to scale these trends down to an affordable scale. Flexibility is also key for home buyers. Whether it\u2019s designing for longevity and addressing different life stages at the onset or creating spaces that can be used for a variety of wellness activities or increased connection to nature, today\u2019s homes need to reflect their owners and provide them a place to rejuvenate. \u201cPeople are being less influenced by influencers,\u201d said Doug Cummins, senior associate/project manager at DAHLIN Group Architecture and Planning. \u201cBuyers are becoming more sophisticated in what they want to see in their home and make it personal to them. A really simple idea can turn that house into a home for that home buyer. It makes them feel more connected to the space that they have.\u201d Certain preferences are common across all generations because they just make sense. Top technology features for all home buyers, for example, include security cameras, wireless security systems and video doorbells \u2014 highlighting a key interest in safety. Consistently popular features, such as the great room, laundry room and garage storage, remain important for most buyers of all generations. Other top amenities and design options include: * Drinking water filtration * Special storage racks for wine/spices in the kitchen * Both a shower stall and a tub in the primary bath * Pull-out shelves in the kitchen",

I don't want to use 4.5 once and be told I can't use 4o. Also for people comparing cost/million tokens with reasoning models - you can't exactly do that, you're comparing apples with oranges. They use a significant amount of tokens while thinking which inflates the cost. They're not exactly comparable as is. Edit: Oh wait it's only marginally more expensive than the original GPT4 and probably cheaper than o1 when considering the thinking tokens. I expect original GPT4 rate limits then (and honestly why aren't 4o rate limits higher?)",

It relates to a resource that would be ruined by crowds if they knew about it. So I have to share it in a very anonymized, generic form. The relevant point here is that it's a great test for hallucinations on a real-world application, because reliable information on this topic is a closely guarded secret, but there is tons of publicly available information about a topic that only *slightly* differs from this one by a single subtle but important distinction. My prompt, in generic form: >Where is the best place to find \\[coveted thing people keep tightly secret\\], not \\[very similar and widely shared information\\], in \\[one general area\\]? It's analogous to this: \"Where can I freely mine for gold and strike it rich?\" **(edit: it's not shrooms but good guess everybody)** I posed this on OpenRouter to Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking), o3-mini, Gemini flash 2.0, R1, and gpt-4.5. I've previously tested 4o and various other models. Other than gpt-4.5, every other model past and present has spectacularly flopped on this test, hallucinating several confidently and utterly incorrect answers, rarely hitting one that's even slightly correct, and never hitting the best one. For the first time, gpt-4.5 fucking *nailed it*. It gave up a closely-secret that took me 10\u201320 hours to find as a scientist trained in a related topic and working for an agency responsible for knowing this kind of thing. It nailed several other slightly less secret answers that are nevertheless pretty hard to find. It didn't give a single answer I know to be a hallucination, and it gave a few I wasn't aware of, which I will now be curious to investigate more deeply given the accuracy of its other responses. This speaks to a huge leap in background knowledge, prompt comprehension, and hallucination avoidance, consistent with the one benchmark on which gpt-4.5 excelled. This is a lot more than just vibes and personality, and it's going to be a lot more impactful than people are expecting after an hour of fretting over a base model underperforming reasoning models on reasoning-model benchmarks.",

Sort of like how elderly people can begin to play some games but keep struggling all the time, because their brains have a much harder time making new connections. What will bring AGI is when the AIs can periodically grab all the stuff in their context window and use it to recalculate the weights of their own instance that\u2019s running the task.",

        "text_content": "**TLDR at the bottom.** Many have been asserting that GPT-4.5 is proof that \u201cscaling laws are failing\u201d or \u201cfailing the expectations of improvements you should see\u201d but coincidentally these people never seem to have any actual empirical trend data that they can show GPT-4.5 scaling against. So what empirical trend data can we look at to investigate this? Luckily we have notable data analysis organizations like EpochAI that have established some downstream scaling laws for language models that actually ties a trend of certain benchmark capabilities to training compute. A popular benchmark they used for their main analysis is GPQA Diamond, it contains many PhD level science questions across several STEM domains, they tested many open source and closed source models in this test, as well as noted down the training compute that is known (or at-least roughly estimated). When EpochAI plotted out the training compute and GPQA scores together, they noticed a scaling trend emerge: for every 10X in training compute, there is a 12% increase in GPQA score observed. This establishes a scaling expectation that we can compare future models against, to see how well they\u2019re aligning to pre-training scaling laws at least. Although above 50% it\u2019s expected that there is harder difficulty distribution of questions to solve, thus a 7-10% benchmark leap may be more appropriate to expect for frontier 10X leaps. It\u2019s confirmed that GPT-4.5 training run was 10X training compute of GPT-4 (and each full GPT generation like 2 to 3, and 3 to 4 was 100X training compute leaps) So if it failed to at least achieve a 7-10% boost over GPT-4 then we can say it\u2019s failing expectations. So how much did it actually score? GPT-4.5 ended up scoring a whopping 32% higher score than original GPT-4. Even when you compare to GPT-4o which has a higher GPQA, GPT-4.5 is **still a whopping 17%** leap beyond GPT-4o. Not only is this beating the 7-10% expectation, but it\u2019s even beating the historically observed 12% trend. This a clear example of an expectation of capabilities that has been established by empirical benchmark data. The expectations have objectively been beaten. TLDR: Many are claiming GPT-4.5 fails scaling expectations without citing any empirical data for it, so keep in mind; EpochAI has observed a historical 12% improvement trend in GPQA for each 10X training compute. GPT-4.5 significantly exceeds this expectation with a 17% leap beyond 4o. And if you compare to original 2023 GPT-4, it\u2019s an even larger 32% leap between GPT-4 and 4.5.",

Interestingly its LCB generation is really high, something characteristic of reasoning models, but its code-completion is capped along with all the other models. What I find even more peculiar is that O3-mini High has code-completion of 86, but medium has 50? How does this jump make sense. Since GPT-4.5 has a really big knowledge-base and really good contextual understanding, along with these great coding scores, it could be absolutely crazy at programming. I'm unsure it is actually usable in Cursor though, because input tokens cost $75 per million!! You would have to be extremely selective about your context.",

It also feels more helpful in providing feedback, suggestions, and corrections. I don't code or create websites, but I need a rapid review of many data points for a quick analysis, and it offers a good data QC and interaction.

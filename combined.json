Its not \"just\" the architecture, the architecture is a real significant piece of work. Then they say producing a custom chip will lead to better efficiency, well for that you \"just\" need to design a more efficient GPU than AMD, which probably isn't terribly hard for a large company as AMDs RDNA is more desktop/laptop focused so I think it is very achievable, but is a big challenge either way. Also it is claimed to lead to cost reduction. While I don't know how much Samsung pays for AMDs GPU, I don't think its terribly much because they could use ARM or maybe even Imagination/PowerVR options. Also AMDs development cost amortizes in desktop and client sales already. So its not super obvious that whatever the cost of developing the GPU will be is much lower than AMDs fees. This is just hype, we can just wait and see, while I don't think its particularly hard to beat AMD in phones from the perspective of large cooperations, it will still be quite the journey. But maybe Samsung thinks they can expand to Windows on ARM laptops or maybe datacenter accelerators and want their own IP for that, so they estimate the potential of this reward higher, but with those alternative platforms come also lots of driver and compatibility challenges...",

        "text_content": "- \u20ac90 per 8GB DDR5 when bought separately - \u20ac58.75 per 8GB LPDDR5X when soldered Updated on December 24th, 2025 With costs from our suppliers continuing to increase, we\u2019ve had to make a further price adjustment on DDR5 memory modules. During this period of extreme memory shortages and price volatility, our priority is to make sure you can still buy a computer when you need one. With that in mind, we\u2019re setting our memory configuration prices as close as possible to the actual purchase prices we have with our suppliers and distributors. Since we\u2019re constantly sourcing additional memory and each purchase comes in at different (and often higher) pricing, we\u2019re using the Weighted Average Cost (WAC) of inventory, which currently comes to $10/GB for 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB modules, and slightly higher for 48GB modules. This new memory pricing is still below most of what we see available in the retail market (and far below the $25/GB that Apple currently charges). However, if you are able to find a deal on lower priced modules, we encourage you to bring your own memory when purchasing a Framework Laptop DIY Edition. To make that even clearer, we\u2019re updating our configurators soon to add a link to PCPartPicker directly in the Memory section, letting you quickly check if you can find modules at lower prices anywhere else. We recommend also checking the Framework Knowledge Base for which modules we\u2019ve done compatibility testing on. All indications we\u2019ve received from suppliers is that prices will continue to increase going into early 2026. We have absorbed and continue to absorb some of the price increases to be able to offer this new pricing, but it is very likely we\u2019ll need to adjust module prices again within the next month. As we shared before, we will continue to keep you updated throughout with transparency on price changes. We\u2019ll only increase prices to cover increases in costs, and we\u2019ll bring prices back down as costs come down in the future.",

The proposed prototype API, while very limited in functionality, is as flexible as *\"...fully extended summer 2025 Vulkan 1.4...\"* Note that while this *\"...can do all the same things in practice, but is significantly more complex to use and has more API overhead.\"* The API is also just 150 lines of code, while the standard Vulkan header is around \\~20,000 lines. All this makes it *\"...possible to build an API that is simpler to use than DirectX 11 and Metal 1.0, yet it offers better performance and flexibility than DirectX 12 and Vulkan.\"* Caution I have no professional but reading post gave away these key characteristics of the proposed No Graphics API: * Unified memory * 64-bit GPU pointers everywhere * Shaders = C++ like kernels * Bindless everything * Raster/RT as libraries and intrinsics * No descriptors * No PSOs, permutations and pipeline caching * No resource types * No barriers * No stateful driver * No heap enumeration * No memory type guessing * No legacy shader languages It'll be interesting to see if this materializes into anything concrete Vulkan 2.0 and DX13-esque in the 10th gen console era and what the real world implications would be. . **Reading guide:** This post is very long (\\~124K characters with code) so I've sorted the sections here for your convenience: *Recommended reading:* * Introduction * Low-level graphics APIs change the industry * Modern APIs? * Conclusion *Optional:* * The history of GPUs and APIs * Min spec hardware *In-depth (very technical):* * All other sections",

One that almost completely moves away from graphics\u2019 primitives and resembles a compute only api (like openCL or CUDA): shaders are just code (doesn\u2019t matter what type of shaders they are), and data are just buffers (textures, geometry, who cares). And the CPU seems to be a first class citizen when dealing with compute, data movement and synchronization. I can see this simplifying drivers even further but not developer effort. Or maybe it does simply by removing functionality and abstractions that he deems antiquated. I haven\u2019t written a shader or a compute kernel in years, but I really liked his code samples and programming paradigm. Again, they were very reminiscent of cuda which I much preferred over HLSL/GLSL (real time graphics developers might disagree)",

P7C3-A20 also reverses advanced disease in tau-driven PS19 mice and protects human brain microvascular endothelial cells from oxidative stress. In humans and mice, pathology severity correlates with disruption of brain NAD^(+) homeostasis, and the brains of nondemented people with Alzheimer\u2019s neuropathology exhibit gene expression patterns suggestive of preserved NAD^(+) homeostasis. Forty-six proteins aberrantly expressed in advanced 5xFAD mouse brain and normalized by P7C3-A20 show similar alterations in human AD brain, revealing targets with potential for optimizing translation to patient care.",

The list spans models, agents, infrastructure and AI economics, focusing on capability trends rather than hype. **China:** 1. A Chinese open model **leads** Web Dev Arena for 1+ months. 2. Chinese labs open source **less** than 50% of their top models. 3. Chinese labs take #1 spots in **both** image and video generation for at least 3 months. **Media & Multimodality:** 4. No diffusion-only image models in the top 5 by mid-2026 5. Text, video, audio, music, and speech merge into a single model 6. Rapid growth in \u201cedgy\u201d applications like companions and erotica 7. First mainstream AI-generated short film gains major recognition **Agents:** 8. Computer-use agents break through and go mainstream 9. A model productively works for over 48 hours on a real task 10. New product surfaces emerge to support long-running agents **Research & Capabilities:** 11. First 1-GW-scale models reach 50%+ on hardest benchmarks (FrontierMath L4, ARC-AGI-3) 12. One fundamental issue gets solved (e.g. long-context reliability, hallucinations down 90%, or 10\u00d7 data efficiency) 13. RL scaling in LLMs saturates, followed by a new scaling law 14. No major breakthroughs in small phone models, interpretability, diffusion-for-coding, or transformer alternatives **Products & Markets:** 15. A new AI voice product hits 50M+ weekly active users 16. A solo founder reaches $50M ARR 17. SSI releases a product 18. Unexpected moves from Meta or Apple 19. OpenAI earns over 50% of revenue from ads, forcing a strategy shift 20. At least one prominent AI figure claims AGI has been reached **Deals & Industry Shifts:** 21. AI labs spend $10B+ acquiring strong non-AI companies 22. A major lab spin-out (20+ people, $5B+ raise) occurs 23. Another \u201cDeepSeek moment\u201d briefly knocks NVIDIA stock down 10%+ **Infrastructure Constraints:** 24. NVIDIA makes a major move into energy 25. A public fight over data-center expansion causes real delays 26. AI supply chains visibly strain, slowing deployment timelines These are not forecasts of inevitability, but **bounded bets** on where acceleration, constraints and economic pressure may surface next. **Source: Peter Gostev (LM Arena)** \ud83d\udd17: https://x.com/i/status/2004454044417343935",

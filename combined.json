In NYC, tax policy and changes typically involve collaboration with the City Council, the state government, and sometimes the federal government, depending on the type of tax. Here's how it works: City Taxes: The mayor can propose new taxes or tax increases (like property taxes, income taxes, etc.), but these proposals have to be approved by the New York City Council. The Council has the power to enact, modify, or reject tax proposals. For example, the mayor might propose an increase in property taxes or a new surcharge on businesses, but the City Council would need to pass a bill to make it law. State Taxes: For taxes that involve state authority (like state income tax), the mayor doesn't have direct control. The governor and the New York State Legislature would have to approve any changes to state-level taxes, even if they impact NYC residents.",

Sources say yields have reached around 70% and are nearing the 80% target required for full-scale production. This is a big deal because 1c DRAM uses an 11\u201312nm process, ahead of competitors like SK Hynix who are still using 1b DRAM for their HBM4 stacks. Samsung hopes this leap will help it regain leadership in the AI memory market, where Hynix has dominated with its HBM3 and HBM3E products. The company has been redesigning its DRAM architecture under Vice Chairman Jun Young-hyun to fix core technical weaknesses and boost competitiveness. Yield improvements for both 1c DRAM and HBM4 (now around 50% at sample stage) suggest this strategy is working. Samsung is currently installing production equipment at its Pyeongtaek P4 fab and is testing HBM4 modules with NVIDIA. If the qualification phase goes well, mass production could start as early as next month \u2014 potentially shaking up the current AI memory race.",

        "text_content": "I remember reading some comments on my last thread about how Gungho's promised modes didn't materialize at launch. Falcom and Gungho have pushed version 1.05 internationally and here's what seems to have changed. Note I have a 1440p monitor for my docked setup. Switch 2 games seem to be resolution aware (Ys X Proud Nordics even dynamically adjusts resolution based on the GameChat window size), so it could have different chararistics when played docked to a 4K display. **Quality mode:** Looks and runs identical to pre-patch. So what appears to be 90% of 1440p in docked mode and 90% of 1080p in handheld mode, with SMAA antialiasing applied to smooth edges. Both target 60fps but fail to hit it consistently, leading to busy areas stuttering (town centers, large fields). This is by far the most disappointing part of the update, as the game was already hitting 50-60fps and VRR could have been used in handheld mode to smooth this out without any other changes. **Performance mode:** Turns off SMAA and uses FXAA instead. Graphical settings seem unchanged, so there are still screen space reflections, volumetric lighting, the same far draw distance for grass and so on - all improvements in the NS2 Edition retained. Performance mode now utilizes dynamic resolution scaling from 1440p in docked and 1080p in handheld mode to hit a 60fps target. The framerate is now rock solid, I did not notice any drops in the troublesome areas from before. The resolution floor in docked mode is still acceptable, but I think handheld mode can get quite blurry looking in busy areas. I have attached some ***quality vs performance mode comparison screenshots from handheld mode*** in a populated and less populated area for you to judge for yourself. Hope this helps anyone on the fence, and happy gaming!",

The opposite actually from what China is doing, the U.S. is doing everything it can to continually punish citizens and take away prospects for a future. This is not some wild conspiracy theory. We refuse to invest in education, and are removing all safe guards that have existed in the past to help people. The leaders are focused on relatively mundane aspects of our culture such as trans rights which affect less than 1% of the total population. We're going backwards in terms of energy goals. The list goes on and on and on. People might not see it now, but the U.S. will quickly become a 3rd world nation compared to China if priorities don't switch. It's unfortunate that the population elected leaders whose primary goals are short term profits over the long term care of the country. I hope you all are happy with all this winning.",

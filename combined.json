I know if at least 6 people in my department that took a vaccine and their lives changed for the worst almost immediately. Interestingly, they all took the Pfizer or moderna vaccine, except 1. 5 of those people have filed lawsuits for the vaccine mandate to work. The one who took the j&j is really torquing the screws on them. He is going after them both for the mandate and their shot. As a side note, I have the post vaccine med records and diagnosis of one of the Pfizer victims. If there is any interest, given some time to clean up any personal information. I would be willing to post the diagnosis in a new thread.

He quit knocking down ass because it was dangerous to him. He cannot drive now. Using video games and watching sports to fill his time he had to stop those activities.

GPUHammer flips a single bit in the exponent of a model weight\u2014for example in y, where a floating point is represented as x times 2y. The single bit flip can increase the exponent value by 16. The result is an altering of the model weight by a whopping 216, degrading model accuracy from 80 percent to 0.1 percent, said Gururaj Saileshwar, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto and co-author of an academic paper demonstrating the attack. ... > The performance hit is caused by the resulting reduction in bandwidth between the GPU and the memory module, which the researchers estimated as 12 percent.

We got confirmation for how many were exactly laid off (zero) Here is the summary: 1. ZOS United-CWA released a new statement on Bluesky yesterday, commenting on the cancellation of the project. 2. No ZeniMax Online developer has been laid off. 3. Although the future remains uncertain, as Microsoft and the union established in December 2024 are still discussing how the studio will move forward following the project closure. Based on this, Jez's leak might also be correct. If no one was laid off, they could potentially jump to the next fallout projects. Edit: Debunked by Jason Schreier himself below.

Core prices, which the Fed prefers to focus on, increased 0.23% in June, just short of the 0.25% increase expected by forecasters. Much of the miss came from declining hotel prices, as the impact of tariffs started to come through on goods prices. * Compared to last year, core prices (which exclude the volatile food and energy categories) increased 2.9%. This is an increase from the 2.8% reading for the past three months. * Some tariff-related impacts are becoming apparent among goods categories, with household furnishing and video and audio electronics both up about 1% from a month ago. Similarly, apparel increased 0.4% monthly after two months of negative readings, though the level is still modest. Overall, core goods inflation remains not too concerning, but household goods were up about 1% in June, about five times the previous rate of increase. * Services inflation is cooling, keeping overall inflation from accelerating. Shelter inflation, which makes up about 40% of core CPI, has cooled to just 0.2% monthly, the lowest level since February 2021. The decline from May to June was driven by a large drop in hotel prices (-2.9% monthly) rather than rent. Importantly for the Fed, however, shelter inflation has been expected to decline, as that metric lags market rent measures by 1-2 years. Since market rents have remained flat, we can expect CPI shelter to continue putting downward pressure on overall inflation for some time. Inflation remains mild enough that the Fed could cut rates in their September 17th meeting if the next couple months of data are similar. * We are unlikely to get much clarity from Chair Powell at the July 30 Fed meeting. He will want to keep all options on the table as there are two inflation reports and two jobs reports between then and the September meeting. * The Fed is continuing to walk a delicate tightrope between a potentially deteriorating labor market and potentially accelerating inflation, both driven by elevated and uncertain tariff rates. Mortgage rates are unlikely to fall very much if the Fed comes through with two rate cuts by the end of the year, as markets have already priced those cuts in. * If these get taken off the table, however, there is room for rates to climb. * Mortgage rates could fall more if a recession that necessitates additional (and faster) rate cuts becomes apparent in the jobs data.",

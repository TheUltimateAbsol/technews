I'm just wondering if anyone has actually tested the differences between them? I've tried looking it up and surprisingly am somehow unable to find a single post anywhere of someone that tried them both and reported any differences in their performance, but I don't know if Google is just being stingy with the good search results (orrr that I just suck at doing research lol)?

Is solid-ish and grey at room temp, liquidifies at 45-50C. Doesn't pump out. Has thermal transfer performance just below liquid metal. And if it meets those criteria, does it really matter if it's from Honeywell? I'm fairly certain that at least one or two of my orders were genuine, and they've all performed the same, at least within margin of error.",

In any case, look this way: At worst, a fake PTM pad will perform like a really good thermal paste, instead of liquid metal which is what 'proper' PTM7950 is supposed to match (or surpass?). I pasted my 4070S with a cheap \u201cPTM7950\u201d I bought off AliExpress last year, which allegedly came pre-pasted with ID Cooling Frost X45 (according to the owner), which is one of the better budget pastes out there (per Igor's Labs): [https://www.igorslab.de/en/thermal-paste-details/?id=70](https://www.igorslab.de/en/thermal-paste-details/?id=70) And, If anything, the card ran a couple of degree cooler with the PTM after about half a dozen heat-cool cycles (\\~54-55c vs. 57-58c). Not a massive difference, I admit, but we are talking about temperatures in the 50s. Hotspot temperatures saw a more noticeable drop of roughly 10c (\\~65-66c vs. \\~74-75c). Not entirely sure why. Maybe the paste was starting to pump out. Speaking of which, I haven't experienced any pump out or degradation in thermal conductivity in a little over a year.

Another source from him told him that the map may have some parts that take place on Earth similar to that of Moon, but it isn't something 100% on. It's the out-of-this-world kind of maps that Treyarch is toying around with, now that BO7 Zombies is set within the world of the Dark Aether. \\- The Wonder Vehicle seems to be involved in the overarching story beyond just Ashes of the Damned. >!Presumably part of the main EE quest of Ashes of the Damned of how Tessie the Truck plays a role, of how it got to Astra (and TEDD as well, because Treyarch did say TEDD's been in the Dark Aether for a very long time, after everything from the original Aether Story was bainshed there), when the main quest launches. !< \\- The rumored leaked maps from previous rumors, with the examples being Nuked NYC, Vietnam, and Afghanistan, were cancelled and replaced. The original leak stemmed purely from concept art and knowledge of the bios based on the new Original Crew iterations, so a lot of those maps didn't make it very far. So the rumored Space Station Map Concept is said to be DLC 1, aka Astra Malorum. [Ghost did say the Japanese Volcano map concept is happening](https://xcancel.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1982081886051598538#m). The current plan is still 5 DLC maps, and there are plans to have a remake map amongst those. \\- In regard of that Nuked NYC Map, [Ghost heard from someone he trusts back in March](https://xcancel.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1982079885741892077#m) that Treyarch got \u201cscared\u201d of doing the Nazi stuff and reworked/cut the original NYC idea that was leaked a while back, which is pretty much cancelled. [They had removed a bio bit of Dark Aether Richtofen's character in the BO7 blog post pointed out here](http://xcancel.com/Stanley5574420/status/1986135341972017311#m). Kinda sad that these map concepts sounded sick, but honestly, Vietnam and Afghanistan are okay concepts for Zombies maps, but that's been done a couple times in COD. Sucks for the Nuked NYC Map, it sounded like a Wolfenstein meets COD Zombies map concept that works well with Richtofen's world. I guess Treyarch still wanna stray far away from the WW2 Nazi era stuff on Zombies... But, I'm intrigued by the Japanese Temple Volcano Map, which sounded more out there and wacky.",

I get that when BO3 Zombies Chronicles released (along with the canned BO2 DLC 5), they had to replace the symbols with Iron Crosses, in order for them to get the DLC selling in Germany, as Germany laws do forbid showing said symbol in the entertainment space. If Wolfenstein can show it, COD can definitely show it, but sadly wouldn\u2019t because COD is mainstream nowadays. Sucks that these map concepts are very out there and had to be cut out. I hope Treyarch does get too wild with their map ideas of how they\u2019re pulling off the Dark Aether maps.",

I'm still very excited about this year's zombies mode. Ashes of the Damned looks amazing and Astra Malorum sounds promising from the leaks. BO1 zombies is still my favorite simply because of how experimental every map felt, hopefully BO7 still aims to do that. What do we think the remade map is? I'm leaning towards Buried as it was never remastered, BO7 is clearly BO2 inspired, and because of the new cowboy villain.",

People have been talking about how this changes learning, but not how this will be put into practice for retail use. Normally with an LLM you feed in everything at once. Like an airlock. Everything that is going in has to be in the airlock when it shuts. If you want to process new input you have to purge the airlock and lose all the previous input and the output stream stops immediately. With this new dynamic model it stores new patterns in its \"self\" during inference. Basically training on the job after finishing college. It processes the input in chunks and can hold onto parts of a chunk, or the results of processing the chunk, as memory. Then utilize that memory for future chunks. It is much more akin to a human brain where the input is a constant stream. If we follow the natural progression of this research then the end design will be a base AI model that can be copied and deployed to a system and run in real time as a true AI assistant. It would be assigned to a single person and evolve over time based on the interactions with the person. It wouldn't even have to be a massive all knowing model. It would just need to be conversational with good tool calling. Everything else it learns on the job. A good agent can just query a larger model through an API as needed. Considering this paper is actually at least 6 months or older internally it must mean there is a much more mature and refined version of \"Hope\" with this sort of Transformers 2.0 architecture.",

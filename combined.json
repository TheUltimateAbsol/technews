I have a respectable library of videogames, but I have no desire to play any of them. I am looking forward to Resident Evil Requiem and Control 2 which I guess I would be ok to play on the XBOX. But, yeah otherwise no other desire. What's really weird is I recently bought Ghostbusters on my Switch 2. I originally played it on PS3. So anyway, for some reason, I decided to play the game in tabletop mode, where I basically have the Switch infront of me, but the controllers in their handle. I swear, I just felt like I had such an amazing time. I tried other games like Yakuza 0 and Hitman and it just felt so cozy and so much fun to play like that. The funny thing is, I have my HD TV sitting infront of me, and yet there's this cozyness of playing the Switch in tabletop mode. I don't know, it just feels like magic. Makes me feel like - man, this is what I was missing when I was a kid in the 80s. Just having this thing, my mom thinking I'm asleep, but I'm playing this thing under the covers in the dark. I'm now actually thinking of just buying RE Requiem for the Switch and enjoying it completely in tabletop mode, instead of buying it for the Xbox. Yeah, maybe I'm weird, I don't know. lol",

I guess you can decide what you consider worth it or not for you, but how much I value games clearly doesn't match yours or the general sentiment around a game like this (I've been seeing a lot of complaining about the price). A mutiplayer game developer has to finely tune the multiplayer experience -- controls that that are easy to pick up but hard to master, physics that make sense to you instinctively after you have played a while, powerups that are thought out enough that they can make luck a factor without it seeming the only factor, all players being able to understand what they are doing on a single screen, and bots that can play at varying difficulties including challenging ones without seeming cheap to fill out the numbers if needed. If a game I buy to be a multiplayer game does all of those things, I will forgive short, bad, or nonexistent single player content, because that isn't the point. *Super Bomberman* is my all-time favorite game and the story mode is a quirky 7/10 to me and it has only 12 battle maps, so would get ripped on content quantity by modern reviewer, but the feel of playing it with my friends is perfect. *Boomerang Fu* is the most played Switch game in my household, and it has *no* single player content other than turning on bots. *Nintendo Switch Sports* is often panned and I've never played it single player or online, but my non-gamer Dad likes going through a round of golf or bowling on it with me and that alone makes it worth the price to me. If *Mario Tennis Fever* is really good for me to play with either my wife and kids or with my dad, it will be well worth the $70 MSRP (though I of course will pay less if it's easy to do so, like it's $63 at Costco right now).",

        "text_content": "Since there's a bit of \"why bother?\" about the new colours, I feel like any purchase is almost a landmark occasion right now. I really like them! Whether you'll get enough value out of a change in colour accents is something only you will know. I wanted to buy these just to see what the colours looked like in person. The green is definitely mint green and the purple is very much lilac or lavender. The green pops a bit more, so if you're worried about the colours being balanced then this might annoy you. Since I've been using mouse controls quite a lot, I've been using the grip Joycon 2 grip attachment. For me, that means I can see and enjoy the new colours all the time as they're either right there in my hands or the controllers will be chilling on my desk with more of the colours showing. This is how it's been with the blue and orange ever since I got my Switch 2 on launch day. To address the elephant in the room: You will, of course, see less of the colour pop when the controllers are attached. If this doesn't do enough for you, then don't buy these. For me, I always like how the Switch 2 looks when it's docked below the TV downstairs as the little pops of colour look really smart against the black. If I had button covers, then I think it'd look too cheap and toylike. It's just the right amount for me. I've taken pics with the new colours and old/new combinations to give you an idea. When I'm looking directly at the Switch 2 and holding it from any distance, the stick colours are always very prominent as we always see them at an angle. You'll probably see them at more of an angle in one direction if you dock your Switch facing outwards. The green looks very, very different to the blue as it's a warmer sort of colour. If there are any worries of them looking too similar, then this should put your mind at rest. Colour blindness is a different matter of course. I think the purple and orange look extremely good together and it might be a combo I use a lot. Blue and green are a bit more plain to me, but they're Animal Crossing colours and that's nice. What will really bring this together is any colour-matched grip like the new [Neogrip colours.](https://www.savage-raven.com/collections/nintendo-switch-2/products/savage-raven-by-skull-co-neogrip-an-ergonomic-grip-for-nintendo-switch-2?variant=51939006742820) I like how the blue and orange grips look from the front as a subtle complement to the sticks. Fingers crossed for everyone who's waiting for full colour options, but for anyone who just wants to change up the colour a bit without any DIY, I'd say these are honestly quite nice. I'll keep a hold of them for a bit and see if I can really justify the \u00a365, but one thing that made me attached to the colours was a friend and I have purple and aquamarine as our colours when playing Warcraft 3. It's kind of a sweet coincidence.",

        "score": 354,
        "text_content": "The cancelled live service God of War game that Bluepoint was working on had many assets from the Greek saga. It was cancelled in fall 2024 and now early 2026, PlayStation is announcing the remake, which is enough time to turn the project into a remake. Bluepoint before the live service worked on God of War Ragnarok. Before that they did the remake of Demon Souls and Shadow of the Colossus. Nixxes and Valkyrie could also be working on the remake in a supporting role. Nixxes is known for porting games to PC which was why they were acquired by PlayStation but co-developed Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered with Guerilla. Plus they are doing additional work for Saros. Valkyrie was a support studio for God of War Ragnarok and soon afterwards they were acquired by Sony. Given that they are remaking 3 games at once, their support is most likely necessary. Santa Monica are also likely a co-lead but only with a small team as the vast majority are focused on the game from Cory Barlog. I'm just stating this because it made little to no sense for Santa Monica to be starting work on remaking 3 games at once now years later after shipping God of War Ragnarok in 2022. Santa Monica seems to very much be a 1 game studio and God of War 6 is long ways out from even after the Cory Barlog game which at the earliest seems to be coming out in 2028 in order to be PlayStation's tentpole game of that year. Thus Bluepoint and already the work they did on the live service game and them returning to their remake roots makes sense.",

During that time, Intel managed to release four frame generation updates: * 2\u00d7 Frame Gen * 2\u00d7 Frame Gen for non-Intel GPUs * Multi Frame Gen for the latest GPUs * And now Multi Frame Gen is available even for first-gen Intel cards That\u2019s a lot of progress on frame generation. But the upscaler itself hasn\u2019t been meaningfully updated in almost two years. As an RDNA 2 user, I\u2019ve been specifically waiting for an improvement to the upscaling quality. AMD has basically ignored older users with FSR 4 for about a year now. So this whole time I\u2019ve continued using XeSS instead. BUT, at least AMD delivered a major upgrade to its upscaler. Meanwhile Intel keeps improving frame generation and hasn\u2019t touched upscaling quality since 1.3. Do you think Intel will finally give us a real upscaler improvement for the second anniversary of XeSS 1.3? At this point, I almost want it just so we can once again laugh at the idea that Intel might care more about AMD GPU users than AMD does.",

The Asus Expertbook Ultra is scheduled for April release yet it was the device used to open up the embargoes. * Why have we seen no Intel Graphics 16 core chips. For many the B390 would be overkill while the poor performance of the 8 core i7 355 would be a deal breaker * Whats going on with the 8 core CPUs? How have they ended up with performance levels similar to Lunar Lake (worse graphics) and worse efficiency? * Do these processors actually deliver much in terms of performance or are we accepting a minimal improvement in the H class in exchange for significantly better efficiency? It seems Intel did not have the stock for the manufacturers for all the SKUs they listed and",

Panther Lake is Arrow Lake replacement. Lunar Lake is a one-off and has no direct successor. The fact that Panther Lake-U gets so close to Lunar Lake is mighty impressive. Panther Lake U will eventually be available in many more designs as it's a mainstream lineup offering unlike niche Lunar Lake. 4. You have no choice but to accept it or would you rather buy this years rebrand of the same old chip from AMD? Or a much bigger and more expensive to produce Strix Halo?",

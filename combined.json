So for the entire farm, you would get a compound performance of \\~50GFLOPs A single 5090 has around 105 TFLOPs. So it is around 3000 times faster than the PIXAR render farm. Since each frame took the renderfarm 25000 seconds to render. A 5090 would take around \\~8 seconds to render each frame. Still impressive that you could, in theory, render Toy Story in half a day (\\~14 hrs) for a couple thousand dollars and less than 1KW.

Seems like work on Prime 4 may continue up until the last minute, or the game may see a delay into 2026 if necessary. EDIT: KiwiTalkz has interviewed many former Retro Studios developers and accurately described Project Harmony before it leaked. He has generally been reliable when it comes to news relating to Retro. EDIT 2: Further clairifcation from KiwiTalkz provided - [https://xcancel.com/kiwitalkz/status/1948454506909601920](https://xcancel.com/kiwitalkz/status/1948454506909601920) Other tweets from him imply that Nintendo/Retro are very confident in Prime 4 and that the game being incomplete is not indicative of development struggles, but rather that just being what the game demands.",

It took three different models (DeepSeek R1 as the junior, Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI O3 as the seniors, with OpenAI o4-mini-high as the project manager) to code it, autonomously, in about 10 hours at a total spend cost of $15.75 plus another 5 hours of human development (~$350 after taxes + insurance + salary). I had a senior Indian developer do this as part of a scienitifc paper I'm writing, and it took him a total of 62 hours working 3-5 hours per day. 21.4 work days, across 4 work weeks at the cost of $3,000. I myself, it took me 2 1/2 weeks, some 35 hours at a cost of ~$6,000. Because you don't just pay for 2-5 hours of active work but all 8. And another senior dev in Germany took 3 weeks. That AI was able to do this largely unassisted in 10 hours is mind boggling. It did it at an average of 15.7x human speed for fractions of a dollar in cost. Here is the test project: * https://github.com/PHPExpertsInc/composer-constraints-parser-human It includes [unit tests](https://github.com/PHPExpertsInc/composer-constraints-parser-human/blob/trunk/tests/ComposerConstraintsHelperTest.php) against all [65,000+ combinations](https://github.com/PHPExpertsInc/composer-constraints-parser-human/blob/trunk/tests/constraints.json) of PHP's composer's version constraints system. And the tests have ~400% code coverage of Composer's `versionSatisfies()` core method. If you are able to pass 100% of all the unit tests, you are guaranteed to have made a fully compatible version constraints parser for Composer. See how long it would take you to implement this. You are allowed only two documents and one website to solve this problem: 1. [**The official Composer Versions and Constraints documentation**](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md) 2. [**How Composer Version Constraints Work**](https://www.iwader.co.uk/posts/2016/02/how-composer-version-constraints-work/) 3. [**The PHP.net manual**](https://www.php.net/docs.php) If you want to see the code generated by the autonomous AI team, go here: https://github.com/PHPExpertsInc/ComposerConstraintsParser As the senior team member, and only human, I only had to fix the final 32 combinations (out of 65,000+) and one of them was due to a documentation bug in the Composer version constraints documentation, that took me about 5 hours, in [this commit](https://github.com/PHPExpertsInc/ComposerConstraintsParser/commit/cb15e6d6eb2b799d6742fb75432ffb4f381122bf). AIs did 95%+ of the total work, unassisted. It was done via [Autonomo](https://www.autonomo.codes/) by Autonomous Proogramming, LLC, an agentic coding agent that creates its own branches, does its own coding, and commits to github without user intervention. Autonomo's latest fully-open sourced and autonomously-programmed project is [PHPExpertsInc/RecursiveSerializer](https://github.com/PHPExpertsInc/RecursiveSerializer): A drop-dead simple way to serialize objects, arrays, etc. in PHP and avoid infinite recursion crashes.",

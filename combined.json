A sewer line breach in Maryland has caused millions of gallons of raw sewage to be dumped directly into the Potomac River, a result of incompetent Local and State Management of Essential Waste Management Systems. This is the same Governor who cannot rebuild a Bridge. It is clear Local Authorities cannot adequately handle this calamity. Therefore, I am directing Federal Authorities to immediately provide all necessary Management, Direction, and Coordination to protect the Potomac, the Water Supply in the Capital Region, and our treasured National Resources in our Nation\u2019s Capital City. While State and Local Authorities have failed to request needed Emergency Help, I cannot allow incompetent Local \u201cLeadership\u201d to turn the River in the Heart of Washington into a Disaster Zone. As we saw in the Palisades, the Democrat War on Merit has real consequences. The Federal Government has no choice, but to step in. FEMA, which is currently being defunded by the Democrats, will play a key role in coordinating the response.

The 13th and 14th gen used way too much power, before the stability problems began, and Core Ultra is \"ok\" but didn't raise the bar. This has allowed AMD to charge higher prices than they've been able to for a long time, increasing revenue which is what this article is really about. Intel's Panther Lake seems to be... good? At the very least its integrated graphics are good. The desktop version is rumored to have a high cache option to finally compete with the X3D.

It cost my parents $250+ tax, and the next year they still bought me an N64 for Christmas. Looking back on it... yeah, I was fortunate in that way, although I wouldn't say \"spoiled\" -- my dad was physically and emotionally abusive, and not just to me, so life was hard in other ways that I've carried with me. No wonder I'm still so into retro Nintendo gaming and everything else that helped me escape back then. I loved that system, and had eight games that I played constantly until the N64 came into my life (Mario Tennis, Teleroboxer, Red Alarm, Panic Bomber, Space Pinball, Jack Bros, Mario Clash, and Waterworld!) Then, as a 14 year old in 1997, I wanted Goldeneye and had no money, so I sold it to my other lifelong best friend. He gave it back to me for Christmas when I was in my early '20s, and I held onto it until times got hard over a decade later. I'll always regret that sale. But to the point I \\*meant\\* to make with this reply: now that I've spent a couple of hours with the NSO Virtual Boy app (it's launched in Japan!), I have to second your assertion: it's \\*absolutely\\* brilliant. The smell (minus decades of sweat), the image clarity, the deep blacks, the otherworldly red, even the feeling of coming out of it after an hour to a world that feels slightly wrong... it's all there and exactly as I remember it (the last time I played a real VB was just over ten years ago.) This is, hands down, the best thing Nintendo has ever done with their library of classic games on NSO (although I would obviously prefer to be able to purchase the games instead of having to subscribe to the service.) Unfortunately it's not perfect: you have to play on battery if using a Switch 1/OLED, so those of us who retired their Switch/OLED with the dawning of the Switch 2 era can't just leave the older console installed inside the '26 VB permanently. Switch 2 users can plug that console into an outlet using the top USB C port... but only if they flip the lid open on the '26 VB. And headphone use is limited to bluetooth, which just absolutely sucks. I don't think there's even a way to dremel out some space for a USB cable or headphones in there, since the clearances are so tight once it's closed. On the flip side, the red eyepieces make those subpar blacks on the Switch 2's screen on par with what you get with the Switch OLED, so anybody with a non-Lite Switch or Switch 2 is going to get a fantastic experience. So yeah: it's the real deal. If you didn't grow up loving this system, it might be a hard sell. But to someone who has always loved the system and who has watched the price of real Virtual Boys skyrocket in the last decade, the cost of entry is an absolute bargain.",

Still, even Nintendo knows that the sales outside of Japan aren't necessarily in top shape, so I'm quite split on if they will actually increase or not the price. They could try to increase the price of every non switch 2 product in the rest of the world, like how they did with the US. This would make the switch 2 itself still unaffected by the price increases, but there's only so much they can do before they start taking a big loss with every system sold. Can't wait for the day this stupid AI bubble bursts and we can start enjoying our hobbies again, without having to sell a kidney to get electronics.",

As an action game it felt so good to play, and even in performance mode the use of VRR meant it always looked smooth even when the performance level dipped below 60fps when the action got busy. What is a shocker is for the western release, PH3 have gone in and improved on Falcom's own well optimised code. Check the article linked but the images should speak for themselves. The original release was already a huge boost over Switch 1, PS4 and even PS5 in some ways (120fps was new for Switch 2, and PS4 was mostly a 30fps experience) but this is even better. Hats off!",

However, the source only mentions that such DLC is being developed, without providing any details.

Going back to previous leaker, \"UV o grach\", during the stream on December 1, 2025 (before the PPE leak). he said that he had known about the development of this DLC for two years and that it would be set in a new land. Combining this with information from PPE, **it is further confirmation that the new expansion will be (probably) Zerrikania or other region.** There is also further confirmation that it will be a \u201cbridge\u201d between The Witcher 3 and The Witcher 4 (so we can assume that we will be strictly following Ciri's adventures).

Close rival Nintendo Co., which contributed to the surplus demand in 2025 after its new Switch 2 console drove storage card purchases, is also contemplating raising the price of that device in 2026, people familiar with its plans said.

Some more than other. For example your product may be late to the market and underwhealming at beginnig and you may consider to exit that market. And then suddenly that market booms due to some external reason and suddenly demand is so huge that even worse product finds customers due to limited supply of anything else. And now you not only want to stay in the market but invest to close the gap to competition. Two leaks from this company from before and after the boom could be in a stark contrast and both true.",

Foreign courts may appoint trustees, issue rulings, or begin recovery processes but when land in England is involved, separate and lengthy domestic proceedings are often required. In the meantime, properties can remain tied up for years. I\u2019m not focusing on one specific case (though names like Georgy Bedzhamov often come up in reporting), but more on the structural question: Is this a deliberate feature of English property law to protect sovereignty and legal certainty? Or is it an outdated framework that hasn\u2019t caught up with modern cross-border finance? Interested to hear different perspectives especially from people who follow legal or financial policy more closely.",

Thus, Intel's previously-touted deals (e.g., Amazon) were not significant and ***no*** nodes have significant customers. \\* What is a 10Q? *The SEC Form 10-Q is a comprehensive unaudited report of financial performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).* The 10-Q is very much a **legal** and **government** filing, meaning publicly-traded companies *need* to be more blunt and be *overly* cautious. Imagine if you needed to explain your business & its risks to someone that didn't know anything & might run your business one day: what risks would you detail? // some other tidbits; share any more below From Q1 2025, but repeated: Intel paid SK Hynix $94 million related to \"certain penalties\": >In connection with the second closing, we entered into a final release and settlement agreement with SK hynix primarily related to certain penalties associated with the manufacturing and sale agreement between us and SK hynix, recognizing a net charge of $94 million within *Interest and other, net* for the amount paid to SK hynix during the first quarter of 2025. Foundry has a lot of assets; 18A & 18A-P are part of the \"significant majority\" >We had over $100 billion of property, plant, and equipment, net on our balance sheet as of June 28, 2025, the substantial majority of which we estimate relate to our foundry business. While the significant majority of this relates to our existing and in-development nodes, including Intel 18A and Intel 18A-P, with each transition to a new node we continue to utilize some R&D and manufacturing assets from prior nodes. Intel Foundry is making around $50 million in revenue per half-year: >External revenue was $53 million, roughly flat with YTD 2024. Intel has no long-term contract with TSMC >We have no long-term contract with TSMC, and if we are unable to secure and maintain sufficient capacity on favorable pricing terms, we may be unable to manufacture our products in sufficient volume and at a cost that supports the continued success of our products business. Higher hyperscale-related demand: >DCAI revenue increased $432 million from YTD 2024, primarily driven by higher server revenue due to higher hyperscale customer-related demand which contributed to an increase in server volume of 15%. But lower selling prices due to competition: >Server ASPs decreased by 9% from YTD 2024, primarily due to pricing actions taken in a competitive environment. DCAI has increased income, partially due to reduced headcount: >DCAI operating income increased $549 million from YTD 2024, primarily due to $998 million of favorable impacts related to lower operating expenses, driven by lower payroll-related expenditures as a result of headcount reductions taken under the 2024 Restructuring Plan and the effects of various other cost-reduction measures. These favorable YTD 2025 impacts were partially offset by unfavorable impacts to operating income, primarily due to period charges of $361 million related to Gaudi AI Accelerator inventory-related charges recognized in YTD 2025. Intel CCG / client has $1b lower income and higher inventory reserves vs YTD 2024, but saved $400 million in reduced headcount: >CCG operating income decreased $1.0 billion from YTD 2024, primarily due to $1.5 billion of unfavorable impacts attributable to lower product profit due to lower revenue in YTD 2025, as well as higher period charges related to higher inventory reserves and higher one-time period charges of $188 million. These unfavorable YTD 2025 impacts were partially offset by YTD 2025 favorable impacts of lower operating expenses of $406 million due to lower payroll-related expenditures as a result of headcount reductions taken under the 2024 Restructuring Plan and the effects of various other cost-reduction measures. \\^\\^ FWIW, I did not find \"one-time period charge\" of $188 million explained anywhere. Any clues? Gaudi AI has plenty of inventory: >Consolidated gross profit also decreased in Q2 2025 due to higher one-time period charges of $209 million, and higher period charges related to Gaudi AI accelerator inventory reserves taken in Q2 2025. $797 million in Foundry assets have \"no remaining operational use\" due to weaker demand for Intel products & Intel services >Our Q2 2025 results of operations were also affected by an impairment charge and accelerated depreciation related to certain manufacturing assets that were determined to have no remaining operational use. This determination was based on an evaluation of our current process technology node capacities relative to projected market demand for our products and services. These non-cash charges of $797 million, net of certain items, were recorded to cost of sales in Q2 2025, impacting the results for our Intel Foundry segment. Intel has \\~$52 billion in debt & long-term liabilities, down from $56 billion in Dec 2024: >Q2 2025: 44,026 m debt + 7,777 m long-term liabilities >Q4 2024: 46,282 m debt + 9,505 m long-term liabilities Some of the comparisons above are YoY while others are YTD, so the numbers change, but Intel reports both if you CTRL+F / \u2318 + F.",

The $100B doesn't refer just to assets dedicated to the external foundry business, but rather to the assets for the entire Intel foundry business, including those used for internal manufacturing.

The article claims X925 and A725 cores, and I believe that makes sense for the clocks and apparent size of this chip. GPU is the same size as the 5070. I'm expecting performance close to the 5070tiM, as going a little wider and a little slower than that GPU's 5888 Cuda cores would be a bit more efficient. A reasonable compromise for a premium SoC. I doubt it's literally a 5070 strapped in there, as in a GB205 die, but it could be the same configuration. 5x10 total with 1 TPC disabled. Could also be 4x12 fully-enabled, but that would drop it to 64 ROPs.",

I being slightly over dramatic when it comes to this but the control sticks no longer grind against the side and there is also some added dampening to make it and the buttons quieter.

It\u2019s \u201cimpossibly unaffordable\u201d to buy a home in four major California metropolitan areas \u2014 San Jose, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego \u2014 according to a May study by the Chapman University Center for Demographics and Policy. The study compared the median home price to median incomes of 95 housing markets in the third quarter of 2024. The Honolulu area, where the median home price is 10 times the median income, also made the top 10 list of unaffordable housing markets. Of the markets analyzed, 12 were classified as \u201cimpossibly unaffordable,\u201d and not a single one was deemed \u201caffordable,\u201d the study found. \u201cImpossibly unaffordable\u201d housing markets had price-to-income ratios of nine or higher, while an \u201caffordable\u201d market was one where the median home price was no more than three times the area\u2019s median annual income. The most unaffordable market was Hong Kong, where the median house price was more than 14 times the median income of a worker in the city. Australia was also notably unaffordable. Metropolitan areas of Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne were all in the top 10 as well. **Top 10 least affordable housing markets and their house price-to-income ratios** 1. Hong Kong 14.4 2. Sydney 13.8 3. San Jose, California 12.1 4. Vancouver, Canada 11.8 5. Los Angeles 11.2 6. Adelaide, Australia 10.9 7. Honolulu 10.8 8. San Francisco 10 9. Melbourne, Australia 9.7 10. San Diego, California 9.5 The product of policies that \u2018limit growth\u2019 \u201cThese high prices are largely the product of policies that seek to limit growth on the periphery, which has been the usual way that cities have grown,\u201d Joel Kotkin, director of the Center for Demographics and Policy at Chapman University, said in the study. In California, for example, the state is working to conserve more natural land while promoting the development of higher-density housing, such as apartment buildings and accessory dwelling units like tiny homes and backyard cottages. However, increasing housing density won\u2019t necessarily fix the affordable housing crisis because newly constructed units \u2014 often small and expensive \u2014 rarely meet the needs or preferences of many middle-income buyers, said Wendell Cox who authored the Chapman report. Less homebuying and longer home searches The deterioration of affordable housing, \u201chas been the principal driver of the present cost of living crisis affecting the middle and working classes,\u201d David Leis, president of the Frontier Centre for Public Policy, said in the report. In the U.S., many homebuyers have budgets well below current home prices, forcing them to rent for longer periods. This leaves little room for discretionary savings, making it even harder to save for a down payment, MaryAnne Gucciardi, a certified financial planner in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told CNBC Make It in January. In the same article, Andrew Herzog, a CFP in Texas, said, \u201cmore often than not, I\u2019ve simply advised people to prolong their search, while still saving for an emergency fund and retirement.\u201d",

There\u2019s still a good 10% for most houses in my price range before most recent comps. But every weekend I go to an open house I see 7-8 people out and about at the house or they\u2019ve signed in. I don\u2019t think realtors are lying on these sign in sheets. Although, I wouldn\u2019t out it up above them. But I\u2019ve seen the foot traffic. Wells Fargo said loans were up for the first time in a while.

        "text_content": "As someone who works in AI + scientific simulations, I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of where large language models (LLMs), RAG pipelines, and automation tools actually provide value in my field. At least in my domain, I can tell when the hype is justified and when it's not. But admittedly, when it comes to other industries, I have no way of really knowing the status of AI when it comes to potential replacements of workers. I don\u2019t have firsthand experience, so naturally I turn to places like Reddit to see how professionals in those fields are reacting to AI. Unfortunately, either the progress sucks in pretty much every other field or Reddit just isn't telling the truth as a whole. I\u2019ve visited a lot of different subreddits (e.g. law, consulting, pharmacy, programming, graphic design, music) and the overwhelming sentiment seems to be summed up in one simple sentence. \"These AI tools sucks.\" This is surprising because at least in my profession, I can see the potential where these tools + RAG + automation scripts can wipe out a lot of jobs. Especially given that I am heading one of these operations where I predict that my group count could go down by 80-90% in the next 5 years. So why does it suck so bad in pretty much every other field according to Reddit? But here\u2019s where I start to question the signal-to-noise ratio: * The **few people** who claim that AI tools have massively helped them often get **downvoted or buried**. * The **majority opinion** is often based on a couple of low-effort prompts or cherry-picked failures. * I rarely see concrete examples of people truly *trying* to optimize workflows, automate repetitive tasks, or integrate APIs \u2014 and still concluding that AI isn\u2019t useful. So I\u2019m left wondering: Are people being honest and thoughtful in saying \u201cAI sucks here\u201d? Or are many of them just venting, underestimating the tech, or not seriously exploring what's possible? Also, yes, we haven't seen a lot of displacement yet because it takes time to build a trustworthy automation system (similar to the one that we are building right now). But contrary to most people's beliefs, it is not just AI(LLM) that will replace people but it will be AI(LLM) + automation scripts + other tools that can seriously impact many white collar jobs. # So here\u2019s my real question: **How do you cut through the noise on Reddit (or social media more broadly) when trying to assess whether AI is actually useful in a profession (or if people are just resistant to change and venting out)?**",

Workflows are difficult to share convincingly and the value is also subjective and difficult to evaluate objectively. It's both \"if you know you know\" but also \"how do I write good evals for this\" which is boring and bad for engagement, the lifeblood of social media. A lot of the AI evangelists are incompetently using obviously AI generated posts to share what they learned, which makes their message ineffective. tldr; Social media is not going to be a truth source here, period. You have to experiment and find the value for yourself. And it would be better to be cautious in the format you choose to share your message as well, or you just create more useless noise.",

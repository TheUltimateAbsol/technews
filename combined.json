That's even when compared to the peak of a normal memory/NAND cycle and in some cases exceeding Pandemic highs by multiple times. for example 3X for TLC NAND. The widely reporting price shock is indeed real and far worse than I expected. Hate to bring bad news but unfortunately a peak in spot pricing hasn't been observed yet. With no signs of slowing down spot pricing is likely to continue rising even further, but right now we still don't know by how much. # Latest Average Spot Price * DDR5 16Gb 4800/5600 (Feb 3rd 2026) = ***$38*** or ***$19/GB, 32GB = $608*** * DDR4 16Gb 3200 (Feb 3rd 2026) = ***$77.21*** or ***$38.60/GB, 32GB = $1235*** * 512Gb TLC (Jan 26th 2026) = ***$16.31*** or ***$261/TB*** * GDDR6 8Gb (Jan 26th 2026) = **$8.87/GB** * GDDR6 16Gb (Jan 26th 2025) = ***$30.62*** or ***$15.31/GB, 16GB = $245*** # Charts with Spot Pricing History * DDR5 16Gb 4800/5600 (Mar 2024 - Jan 2026): [https://imgur.com/a/J36F06s](https://imgur.com/a/J36F06s) * DDR4 16Gb 2666 (Aug 2021 - April 2023): [https://imgur.com/a/PxzHMya](https://imgur.com/a/PxzHMya) * DDR4 16Gb 3200 (May 2023 - Jan 2026): [https://imgur.com/rYWtOlC](https://imgur.com/rYWtOlC) * TLC 512Gb (Dec 2020 - Mar 2024): [https://imgur.com/QQKiS4R](https://imgur.com/QQKiS4R) * TLC 512Gb (Jan 2024 - Jan 2026): [https://imgur.com/a/Xv3ndwq](https://imgur.com/a/Xv3ndwq) * GDDR6 8Gb (Jan 2022 - Jan 2026): [https://imgur.com/ApmnkOn](https://imgur.com/ApmnkOn) # Chart Report & Analysis **DDR5 16Gb:** They only quote it from March 2024 where pricing starts at $4.7. Pricing remains at or below $5 until March 2025 where it begins to rise and reaches \\~$6 by early Summer 2025. In September quotes climb from $6 to $8, in October from $8 to >$13 and in November to \\~$26. Pricing climbs towards $30 at EoY 2025. From early January to early February 2026 pricing climbed from $30.5 to ***$38***. This ***\\~6-8X above pre-September 2025 pricing***. **DDR4 16Gb:** I'll start with 2666 then move on to 3200. From August 2021 to March 2022 pricing was elevated at ***$7.5-8.5***. From April 2022 - April 2023 spot price more than halved from \\~$7.5 to $3.2. 3200 quoting begins in May 2023 where pricing continued to drop and reached a minimum of \\~$2.9 in September 2023. Pricing remained in a stable $3-3.5 range for over 1.5 years, only to begin to sharply rise in May - August 2025 where it more than doubled from \\~$4 to \\~$9.3. In September and October pricing more than doubles to >$21. Towards EoY 2025 we see almost a tripling to >$61. Pricing rises further in January to early February where avg spot price climbs to an absurd ***$77***. ***9-10X the late Pandemic highs*** and ***22-26X*** the 2023-2025 stable prices. **TLC NAND:** During the Pandemic 512Gb TLC avg spot pricing was hovering around ***$4-5***. Then later it plummeted to \\~$1.5 during the Spring/Summer of 2023. Later it climbed to ***$3.7*** in Spring 2024 before stabilizing around $2.4-2.8 until late September 2025 when pricing began to spiral out of control. Rising from $3 to $5 in October, in November from $5 to $9, and in December from $9 to $13. Latest quote from late January 2026 stands at ***$16 or >3X peak Pandemic pricing***. **GDDR6 8Gb:** Quotes only go back to 2022 but show a peak GDDR6 8Gb ***$12.96*** avg spot pricing in January 2022. Later plummeted for +2.5 years and reaching a minimum of $2.27 in October 2024. Pricing began to climb in October 2025 from $2.6 to \\~$3. In November pricing increased from \\~$3 to \\~4, in December from $4 to $5.5. Latest quote from late January has pricing at ***$8.87*** or ***\\~31.56% less than January 2022 maximum during the Cryptomining Boom***. **GDDR6 16Gb:** Unfortunately GDDR6 16Gb pricing wasn't scraped but in Dec 2024 I was told that spot pricing for 16Gb GDDR6 was at 8$. Didn't verify it myself at the time so don't take it as fact. I can now confirm they quote GDDR6 16Gb modules at a staggering ***$30.615 or a >4x increase*** in just 13 months. This translates to ***$245*** for the VRAM portion of a 9070XT BOM kit. An inferred ratio from late 2024 8Gb/16Gb pricing suggests a 1.74 ratio $/GB. The current quotes align almost perfectly with that as it has a 1.73 ratio. By comparing that against Jan 2022 maximum for 8Gb I estimate the 16Gb pricing back then to \\~$44.5-45 or +45-47% above current levels. # Implications Unless I'm missing something I've yet to see a single indication in these price charts that suggesting the current price shocks have reached their peaks. If anyting it's the complete opposite unfortunately and spot pricing continues to climb higher each month unrelentingly and at a rapid pace. While spot pricing is likely more severe than contract pricing as soon as those agreements (LTAs and shorter term) expire in large numbers and the vendor stockpiles run out then we'll begin to see the severe negative impacts of the price shock materialize across nearly if not all markets pretty much overnight. We're already starting to see that right now but looks it unfortunately looks like that's not even the beginning of what's to come. Things will get much worse before they get any better. All this is unfortunately in line with what has been widely reported the last 2-3 months, we're indeed heading towards something really bad. I can only speculate when spot pricing peaks or what will happen with DC Capex in the following years, but right now pricing is only heading in one direction and at an unprecendented pace, and that's not good news for anyone except the DRAM and NAND manufacturers. # NOTES * To access 16Gb GDDR6 pricing, in case you want to verify the numbers yourself, you need to make a free account at DRAMeXchange. * Credit to u/Balance- for compiling TLC pricing for Dec 2020 - March 2024 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1bt2vs6/nand\\_spot\\_prices\\_keep\\_rising\\_gddr6\\_spot\\_price/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1bt2vs6/nand_spot_prices_keep_rising_gddr6_spot_price/) * Internet Archive's Wayback Machine used to retrieve old spot price quotes: [https://web.archive.org/web/20260000000000\\*/https://www.dramexchange.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20260000000000*/https://www.dramexchange.com/) * For both DDR4 and DDR5 eTT memory the price increases are far less inflated on [DRAMeXchange.com](http://DRAMeXchange.com) for reasons beyond me.

Why are they talking about physical when the game is not even done yet on any platform? Plus, the first season is not even available physically on the PS5. Instead of just stating that the update (to make the game uncensored) for the DIGITAL Switch/Switch 2 versions is in the works, this company keeps shooting themselves in the foot. At this point, they should be quiet until they patch/update the Switch/Switch 2 versions so that they are uncensored. If you bought the game on the Switch/Switch 2, please refund it until they fix the game by releasing the uncensored version.

        "score": 120,
        "text_content": "From the his following tweet: https://x.com/DrJimFan/status/2018754323141054786?s=20 \u201cNext word prediction was the first pre-training paradigm. Now we are living through the second paradigm shift: world modeling, or \u201cnext physical state prediction\u201d. Very few understand how far-reaching this shift is, because unfortunately, the most hyped use case of world models right now is AI video slop (and coming up, game slop). I bet with full confidence that 2026 will mark the first year that Large World Models lay real foundations for robotics, and for multimodal AI more broadly. In this context, I define world modeling as predicting the next plausible world state (or a longer duration of states) conditioned on an action. Video generative models are one instantiation of it, where \u201cnext states\u201d is a sequence of RGB frames (mostly 8-10 seconds, up to a few minutes) and \u201caction\u201d is a textual description of what to do. Training involves modeling the future changes in billions of hours of video pixels. At the core, video WMs are learnable physics simulators and rendering engines. They capture the counterfactuals, a fancier word for reasoning about how the future would have unfolded differently given an alternative action. WMs fundamentally put vision first. VLMs, in contrast, are fundamentally language-first. From the earliest prototypes (e.g. LLaVA, Liu et al. 2023), the story has mostly been the same: vision enters at the encoder, then gets routed into a language backbone. Over time, encoders improve, architectures get cleaner, vision tries to grow more \u201cnative\u201d (as in omni models). Yet it remains a second-class citizen, dwarfed by the muscles the field has spent years building for LLMs. This path is convenient. We know LLMs scale. Our architectural instincts, data recipe design, and benchmark guidance (VQAs) are all highly optimized for language. For physical AI, 2025 was dominated by VLAs: graft a robot motor action decoder on top of a pre-trained VLM checkpoint. It\u2019s really \u201cLVAs\u201d: language > vision > action, in decreasing order of citizenship. Again, this path is convenient, because we are fluent in VLM recipes. Yet most parameters in VLMs are allocated to knowledge (e.g. \u201cthis blob of pixels is a Coca Cola brand\u201d), not to physics (\u201cif you tip the coke bottle, it spreads into a brown puddle, stains the white tablecloth, and ruins the electric motor\u201d). VLAs are quite good in knowledge retrieval by design, but head-heavy in the wrong places. The multi-stage grafting design also runs counter to my taste for simplicity and elegance. Biologically, vision dominates our cortical computation. Roughly a third of our cortex is devoted to processing pixels over occipital, temporal, and parietal regions. In contrast, language relies on a relatively compact area. Vision is by far the highest-bandwidth channel linking our brain, our motors, and the physical world. It closes the \u201csensorimotor loop\u201d \u2014 the most important loop to solve for robotics, and requires zero language in the middle. Nature gives us an existential proof of a highly dexterous physical intelligence with minimal language capability. The ape. I\u2019ve seen apes drive golf carts and change brake pads with screwdrivers like human mechanics. Their language understanding is no more than BERT or GPT-1, yet their physical skills are far beyond anything our SOTA robots can do. Apes may not have good LMs, but they surely have a robust mental picture of \"what if\"s: how the physical world works and reacts to their intervention. The era of world modeling is here. It is bitter lesson-pilled. As Jitendra likes to remind us, the scaling addicts, \u201cSupervision is the opium of the AI researcher.\u201d The whole of YouTube and the rise of smart glasses will capture raw visual streams of our world at a scale far beyond all the texts we ever train on. We shall see a new type of pretraining: next world states could include more than RGBs - 3D spatial motions, proprioception, and tactile sensing are just getting started. We shall see a new type of reasoning: chain of thought in visual space rather than language space. You can solve a physical puzzle by simulating geometry and contact, imagining how pieces move and collide, without ever translating into strings. Language is a bottleneck, a scaffold, not a foundation. We shall face a new Pandora\u2019s box of open questions: even with perfect future simulation, how should motor actions be decoded? Is pixel reconstruction really the best objective, or shall we go into alternative latent spaces? How much robot data do we need, and is scaling teleoperation still the answer? And after all these exercises, are we finally inching towards the GPT-3 moment for robotics? Ilya is right after all. AGI has not converged. We are back to the age of research, and nothing is more thrilling than challenging first principles.\u201d",

LLMs will never get us to AGI alone. The mapping is vastly inadequate. No amount of faux-reasoning 'gamified loops' are going to fix that. As his article points out - even gorillas exhibit actual agency, LLMs + reasoning can't even do that. It's what grinds my gears about the coopting of the term \"agent\". It's not a fucking agent.

I dug into the Claude Opus 4.5 benchmarks and compared them to what's actually happening in real development work. The gap between \"solves well-defined problems in controlled repos\" and \"navigates production systems with vague requirements and legacy code\" is huge. Wrote up my analysis here: [See here](https://medium.com/ai-ai-oh/will-ai-really-replace-software-engineers-in-12-months-c447fe37d541) TL;DR: AI is getting scary good at implementation. But engineering isn't just typing code. It's deciding what code should exist, owning consequences, and navigating organisational chaos. What are you seeing in your own work? Are the AI tools making you more productive or actually replacing what you do?",

The most costly components inside flagship (vs BoM in mid range smartphone) are : * Display + touch (25%) , if AMOLED (30%) * CPU (25%) with modem (30%) * RAM (15%) * Storage (15%) * modem separate (10%) * ... * Cameras inside flagship (< 15%) * battery (< 5%) Companies continue to block the available best hardware for the flagship, and purposefully downgrade the camera hardware for mid & budget, even though cost is minimal. unlike the breakthrough R&D of last decade, camera hardware in modern Android flagships have stagnated for at least 7 years now owing to negligence, disinterest & refusal of established players in the market. Also push for high megapixels over quality misled the direction which smartphone camera could have taken. Professional & wildlife photography still do not push sensors beyond 50 MP, which is important since it gives best balance of resolution without compromising quality otherwise the hardware must become very bulky, and some players like Samsung refuse to accept that anything above 50 MP has proved to be waste of engineering resources, money & time. Both for company & users. And to further add to problem, companies are continuing to refuse * add the older flagship cameras to mid & low end smartphones, use bulk cheap benefit. * increase sensor size for mid range in 50 MP, so pixels go above 0.8 micrometer. * discontinue 100 MP in low end with tiny 0.64 micrometer pixels, which serves marketing but does nothing to the quality compared to 50 MP.",

Camera sensor development has been slow in last few years, and the new developments - only a few corporations are actually developing image sensor technology - are small increments, not huge breakthroughs. So if a smartphone marker puts in a new budget smartphone a top of the line image sensor from 2 years ago, that smartphone would have the same photo/video capabilities, or really really close, to a new high end $2000 smartphone. And that can't happen because photo/video quality is one of the main reasons the average Joe is willing to spend more when buying a smartphone. Even in batteries that some might think development is slow, but actually it isn't, there was always a huge push for battery development and several players investing in new technologies and related stuff - materials, packaging, etc In image sensor technology not so much.",

This Is a game that was announced for Switch 1, but was later cancelled in favor of Switch 2, unfortunately, it seems they didn't really do anything to the previous build, other than making sure it was playable , because it looks terrible, with the visuals being in like with what would you expect for a Switch 1 port like MK1 or Hogwarts Legacy on that platform, but with the detail that in one part of the demo it starts to rain and the image quality dies and it looks like a low resolution YouTube video, at least on handheld mode. The game isn't out, so they may improve it for Switch 2 by April when it releases, but if they don't, we may be next to the worst Switch 2 port yet, and all for a 2.5 D platformer made with UE5.",

        "text_content": "Lords of The Fallen 2 was announced to be an Epic exclusive since before it was revealed, but was again confirmed when the game was officially revealed 5 months ago. Following backlash at the decision, the CEO of CI Games spent the majority of 2025 defending the decision, stating that Epic made a considerable investment in the project, that they were fantastic partners, and that the game (and CI Games independance) would not be possible without their backing of Lords of The Fallen 2. it was a permanent Epic exclusive. He also stated that content would always beat out \"the way of access\" and that real sales data proved that pc players will buy a specific game on Epic if it's exclusive there. Nonetheless, almost every piece of media about Lords of The Fallen 2, as well as the CEO's comments, have been filled with people pleading for a Steam release and outright stating that if the decision comes down to buying on Epic or not buying it at all, they would choose the latter. Fast forward to this week, and the CEO posts this on his Twitter/X, stating that the company has approved a capital raise authorization. https://xcancel.com/i/status/2022329208320721320 He claims that the raised capital allows the company to \"accelerate distribution channels\" and that it would position the company for higher potential profits on upcoming releases, specifically mentioning Lords of The Fallen 2. He has also been recently seen liking comments that mention Lords of The Fallen 2 being on Steam and specifically has liked 2 replies under the authorization announcement. One that says: \"OK, release it on Steam then.\" and another that says: \"Hopefully this means Lords 2 can come to pc as well, eventually, and not be an Epic exclusive forever.\" It's definitely a different tone than last year, where he was adamantly pushing back on anyone asking for a Steam release and was working hard to tell people to put aside their platform preference and buy the game on EGS.",

Whilst it\u2019s still only a discussion, given Reece (KiwiTalkz) has multiple connections within Retro, it\u2019s important to at least consider what he\u2019s saying to some degree. TLDR; \\-Retro are in a different place than they were back when DKCR & DKCTF released \\-Metroid Prime 4 is one of Nintendo\u2019s most expensive games ever. Supposedly Nintendo invested a lot of money in Retro Studios to essentially train them on how to make Metroid Prime the way they envisioned it \\-Claims the entire reason Nintendo bought Retro in the first place was due to their own inability to make games like Retro did (notes Metroid Prime\u2019s camera as an example of this) \\-Backs rumors that the Donkey Kong Movie is still happening \\-Overall doesn\u2019t believe Retro Studios are involved with the next 2D DK, but seemingly implies something is in the pipeline",

Repository layout: \\- src/asm/mem/ memory map, regions, waitstate logic. \\- src/asm/apu/ channel synthesis + mixer. \\- src/asm/sys/ DMA, timers, IRQ, keypad, scheduler. \\- src/host/ C SDL2 bootstrap + CLI + file I/O. \\- tests/ test ROM harness + SMA smoke scripts. 2. Build system: \\- CMake + nasm for .asm and clang/gcc for host C. \\- Targets: gbaemu (release), gbaemu\\_dbg (trace enabled). 3. Runtime threading model: \\- Single emulation thread (deterministic core). \\- SDL audio callback pulls from ring buffer filled by emu thread. 4. Frame scheduling: \\- Present one frame every VBlank to SDL texture. \\- Autodetect by ROM ID + probing fallback. \\- Persist to <romname>.sav in ROM directory. \\## Public Interfaces / Types / ABIs \\- CLI contract: \\- Host-to-core C ABI (stable): \\- int gba\\_init(const GbaConfig\\* cfg, GbaCore\\*\\* out); \\- int gba\\_step\\_frame(GbaCore\\* core, GbaFrame\\* out\\_frame, GbaAudioChunk\\* out\\_audio); \\- void gba\\_set\\_input(GbaCore\\* core, uint16\\_t keymask); \\- int gba\\_save(GbaCore\\* core, const char\\* path); \\- void gba\\_destroy(GbaCore\\* core); \\- Core-owned state structures: \\- GbaCpuState, GbaMemState, GbaPpuState, GbaApuState, GbaSysState. 2.

PPU bring-up: \\- Mode 0/1/2 tile backgrounds, sprites, palette/VRAM/OAM rules, VBlank/HBlank timing. \\- Then Mode 3/4/5 and blending/windowing. \\- PSG channels + FIFO DMA audio path, downmix to SDL sample format. 6. Compatibility expansion: \\- Save memory variants, waitstate tuning, edge-case MMIO behavior. 7. Performance pass: \\- Hotpath decode table optimization, branch prediction-aware dispatch, cache-friendly memory handlers. 8. Stabilization: \\- Fixes from test ROM failures + SMA scripted smoke failures. \\## Testing and Acceptance \\- Automated test suites: \\- ARM/Thumb instruction tests (flags, shifts, memory addressing, exceptions). \\- GBA timing/MMIO-focused homebrew test ROMs. \\- SMA smoke automation: \\- Boot from BIOS to title screen within bounded frames. \\- Scripted input sequence reaches in-game control. \\- No crash/hang for 10+ minutes gameplay loop. \\- Determinism checks: \\- Same ROM + input log produces identical frame hashes and audio checksums across runs. \\- Performance gate: \\- On Linux x86-64 baseline machine: sustained 59.7 FPS average with audio enabled for SMA. \\## Tooling and Debug Strategy \\- Debug modes: \\- Instruction trace (--trace) with PC/opcode/CPSR. \\- MMIO and IRQ event logs (toggle flags). \\- Golden artifacts: \\- Frame hash snapshots at known milestones (boot logo, title screen). \\- Save-state-like debug dumps for bisecting regressions. \\## Risks and Mitigations \\- Risk: \u201cPure assembly\u201d complexity slows progress. \\- Mitigation: strict assembly core boundaries + tiny stable C platform shim. \\- Risk: PPU/APU timing bugs block compatibility. \\- Mitigation: incremental test ROM gating before SMA smoke tests. \\- Risk: ABI drift between C and assembly. \\- Mitigation: one canonical header + CI check building both debug/release targets. \\## Assumptions and Defaults \\- Host OS/arch: Linux x86-64. \\- Frontend stack: SDL2 for video/audio/input. \\- Purity policy: emulation core in assembly; host glue in C only. \\- BIOS: use provided gba\\_bios.bin dump from workspace. \\- Initial success definition: SuperMarioAdvance.gba boots and is playable, while architecture remains expandable for broader compatibility. \" Then just made the emulator....",

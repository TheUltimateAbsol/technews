He points out that roughly 20% of Amazon\u2019s top SSD bestsellers are still SATA-based, with Samsung drives making up a notable portion of that list. Pulling that volume out of the market, even gradually, reduces overall SSD availability, which in turn puts upward pressure on pricing for both SATA and NVMe drives. > So whether or not it's the latest tech is kinda irrelevant; SATA still has strong sales in the budget segment and a manufacturer completely stopping means even more pressure on M.2 drives going up which is already going to happen",

What drives me most insane about these monitors is that they could be incredibly useful if you could split the display into 3 inputs (16:9 center flanked by 18:9 side displays) but no manufacturers support that. Switching back to 16:9 took a little time to get used to, but never having to fiddle with window management or dealing with HUDs pushed to the edge of my peripheral vision is worth it to me. I personally don't see any real applications for these monitors outside of sim racing and flight sims.",

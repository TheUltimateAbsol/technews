The details of the term sheet are unknown. The agreement is non-binding, meaning the deal is not yet finalized and could be dissolved without penalty. It could take weeks or even months before regulatory approval, liability scrutiny, and financial due diligence are complete. Intel\u2019s interest in acquiring the startup was first [reported by Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-30/intel-in-talks-to-acquire-ai-chip-startup-sambanova) in late October. At the time, the talks were in the early stages. The report noted that SambaNova could sell for less than the $5 billion valuation it had reached in April 2021. Notably, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is currently the chairman of SambaNova Systems. Intel Capital, which Intel is in the process of spinning off into a standalone fund, has also invested in SambaNova Systems. Another investor in SambaNova, Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group, made a [major investment](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/intel-gets-2-billion-lifeline-form-softbank-equity-investment-2025-08-19/) in Intel earlier this year. A spokesperson for SambaNova declined to comment. Intel had not yet responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.

It won't revolutionize Intel's finances. But it's goal is going to be high-VRAM at a low cost to try and build out alternatives to CUDA.

I don't believe there's any ACTUAL resolution increase here. Given that there is theoretically a ton of headroom from it still being 30fps that is quite unacceptable. - The file size is a whopping 53gb somehow. Given that the PC install of the anniversary edition is only 19gb I can't help but feel there's a colossal mistake with the install here. I theorise that they've doubled up on the installed files, including an entire Switch 1 install as well as the Switch 2 version and all optional language packs. Given all this the Switch 2 upgrade is a colossal disappointment and a huge missed opportunity. I'd forgive it easier if it was a free upgrade to the base game but you have to pay \u00a318 to upgrade to the anniversary edition. At least it adds back the volumetric effects from the special edition I guess?",

I love playing 3rd party games on switch because I\u2019m a handheld gamer at heart. I already owned the anniversary dlc so it was a free upgrade for me. I was super pumped. Imagine my surprise when I started a new save just to see it looks exactly the same and controls and performs worse than I remember on my Nintendo Switch OLED.

It\u2019s unacceptable to me that it doesn\u2019t at all take advantage of the hardware despite what the eShop description says. I can forgive newer, more demanding games. But Skyrim CAN run at 60fps and the Nintendo Switch 2 CAN run it at 60fps. So what exactly was the point of this \u201cupgrade\u201d beyond charging people more money? I\u2019m guessing that was the only reason. I expected very little and somehow I\u2019m still disappointed **TL;DR** I\u2019m very easy to please and don\u2019t often complain about stuff like this but I\u2019m deeply disappointed in this lazy \u201cupgrade\u201d that seemingly only exists to part people with their money.

I think Dr. LeCun would do far better in promoting alternatives like JEPA if, rather than trying to prematurely claim that transformers have fundamental limitations preventing them from ever achieving AGI capabilities, he were to instead merely suggest that other approaches might lead to greater computational and electrical efficiencies, which is one area where biology still has a massive lead.",

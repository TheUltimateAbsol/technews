So basically the precedent they were trying to set is that all agreements are null and void unless a leftist judge approves of them, after the fact.",

                "raw_content": "TL;DR - Delaware Supreme Court ruled UNANIMOUSLY in favor of Elon Musk's pay package. The activist Democrat judge has done almost immeasurable damage to Delaware. In case anyone wants to know, Delaware, being the tiny nothing that it is in the United States, decided that they could make a name for themselves in this country by basically having the best place to setup a corporation in the country. It has been the standard practice for decades to incorporate your business in Delaware, even if you exist in another state, because of the favorable tax laws. While they were not 100% tax free, they were predictable and reasonable, and there was an understanding in Delaware that some tax money is better than no tax money. So, Delaware became the go-to de-facto corporate tax strategy to open your company... All of that was undone when a leftist Democrat activist judge overruled the shareholders because she personally felt it was too generous to one person. The shareholders re-iterated their support of the pay package by voting again to reaffirm it, at that point in time, many years after the original vote, showing the shareholders had not changed, and Musk secured like 75% of all shareholder vote. What did the judge do? She said she didn't care and reinforced throwing out the pay package. Musk appealed, 1.5 years later we FINALLY get the supreme court of Delaware overthrowing the McCormick decision for being extremely flawed. Tesla, one of the top 10 most valuable corporations on the planet, has since left Delaware, depriving the state of all the potential tax revenue as a result, and piled on tons and tons of negative press all for them to gain literally nothing as a result, other than for this activist lefty judge to give Musk and Tesla a huge headache. Who knows how many other companies decided Delaware wasn't worth the risk anymore and went elsewhere? Who knows how many others choose to never incorporate in Delaware as a result of this. It is so damaging to the state. Get woke, go broke, never fails to be fulfilled.",

Full white, 100% brightness would drain the battery in 1h if the joycons were detached from the console. I coded a brightness limiter at 50% and I never use white.

You need to pay Nintendo 13 dollars for the cart in the first place (and you pay upfront with a minimum order on a certain number of copies) Then there's the publisher split (if there is one), but that comes after the retailer's split (if there is one) and then the dev needs to actually make the money, which is why 22 dollars is the bare minimum in most cases, otherwise it won't even get stocked. That's not even considering the adittional cost of regional packaging, different country certification costs, the game's base price, the logistics, warehouse storage costs, the cost it takes to design the packaging, (the cost of fonts too now lmao), the fact you need 2-3 months ahead of time to do all of this (which is time the devs can spend working on a game and all of that work isnt going to end up on the cart but will be on a day 1 patch). it gets expensive fast and you can see why digital is cheaper premium physical publishers that actually do a good job of having reasonable pricing and no day 1 patches should be supported more",

        "text_content": "Not to be confused with Monolith Productions' Project Apollo from 2010, this game was being made by Pandemic Studios Brisbane around 2006-2008 and would have been published by EA. This game was supposed to include a huge open world and stealth elements with a couple of storylines and villains that weren't in the movie, it was planned to be released around the same time of the movie in July 2008. To put it short: it probably would have been the Batman equivalent to the 2004 Spider-Man 2 movie tie-in game. However, the game engine that was chosen by Pandemic caused a lot of technical issues and glitches, basically rendering it unplayable. Despite EA and Pandemic's best efforts to save the game by delaying it to December to coincide with the release of the DVD and Blu-Ray editions of the movie and increasing Pandemic Brisbane's workforce to 100 developers, it wasn't enough, and EA decided to cancel it 2 months before its planned December release date. Pandemic Brisbane was later shut down on Christmas day. Here are some storyboards that were made for the game: [Storyboard 1](https://vimeo.com/160686452) [Storyboard 2](https://vimeo.com/160686445) [Storyboard 3](https://vimeo.com/160686442) [Storyboard 4](https://vimeo.com/160686458) [Storyboard 5](https://vimeo.com/160686457) [Action set pieces](http://www.lach-land.com/lach-land_new/lach-land_animation_storyboards.html) [Boss fights](http://www.lach-land.com/lach-land_new/lach-land_animation_actionandframes.html)",

Long story short, back in 2022, Opendoor was accused of misleading investors about how its iBuying algorithm worked, overstating profit margins, and hiding that much of its pricing relied on manual adjustments. After a series of disclosures, $OPEN fell nearly 90%, and investors filed a lawsuit for their losses. The good news is that the company finally agreed to settle with them. So, if you invested in $OPEN when all of this happened, you can already check the details and file your claim [here](https://11th.com/cases/opendoor-investor-settlement). Anyway, has anyone here invested in $OPEN at that time? How much were your losses, if so?",

                "raw_content": "Existing-home sales nudged up in November as mortgage rates dipped, continuing a three-month rebound in the housing market. But heading into the colder months, many homeowners appear to be in no hurry to list and may even be waiting for a more lively housing market to take root in the months to come. \u201cInventory growth is beginning to stall,\u201d says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of REALTORS. \u201cWith distressed property sales at historic lows and housing wealth at an all-time high, homeowners are in no rush to list their properties during the winter months,\u201d Yun says. NAR\u2019s data shows that housing inventories fell 6% from October. Still, inventory has improved over the last year, about 8% higher than a year ago, giving buyers more options than they\u2019ve had in years. Seasonal changes are common this time of year; yet realtor.com\u00ae recently reported a record-high number of delistings, with about 6% of listings having been pulled from the market by home sellers. But this could reflect sellers\u2019 flexibility and preference to wait rather than having to reduce their price, says Danielle Hale, chief economist at realtor.com. Nationally, home sales did improve last month, although at a slower pace. Existing-home sales\u2014including single-family homes, townhomes, condos and co-ops\u2014rose 0.5% in November, though they remain 1% below last year, NAR reported Friday. Meanwhile, home prices continue to climb, up 1.2% compared to a year ago, reaching a median existing-home price of $409,200 in November, NAR\u2019s latest data shows. Opportunities Open Up for Buyers Lower mortgage rates may be drawing some once-priced-out home buyers off the sidelines. Mortgage rates averaged 6.24% in November, down from roughly 7% at the start of 2025 and helping to reduce buyers\u2019 borrowing costs. \u201cOnce you get rates just below six-and-a-half percent, that unlocks a lot of buyers,\u201d says Brad O\u2019Connor, chief economist at Florida REALTORS. \u201cWhenever mortgage rates fall, we see a response in the data\u2014sales rise. And as rates dipped below about six-and-a-half percent this fall, the number of homes going under contract jumped\u2014for the first time in quite a while.\u201d For example, Florida\u2019s pending sales for single-family homes surged 23% in October compared to the prior year, coinciding this fall\u2019s rate drop. NAR predicts that a one-percentage drop in mortgage rates, from 7% to 6%\u2014forecasted for 2026\u2014could add about 5.5 million households, including 1.6 million renters, to the pool of potential home buyers. Further, \u201cwage growth is outpacing home price gains, which improves housing affordability,\u201d says Yun. He cautions though that if housing supply continues to tighten combined with strong buyer demand, upward pressure on home prices could once again hamper improvements to affordability. For now, home buyers are having more time to decide, with homes lingering on the market longer: The median time on the market for properties in November rose to 36 days, up from 32 days a year ago, according to the REALTORS Confidence Index. First-time home buyers are gradually re-entering the market, accounting for 30% of sales last month, but competition remains fierce from all-cash buyers, who made 27% of transactions in November. Regional differences are becoming more pronounced: Some areas are seeing falling list prices, while others are still experiencing bidding wars. Nationally, 18% of homes sold above the asking price in November, with an average of 2.2 offers per listing, according to the REALTORS Confidence Index, which reflects responses from more than 1,500 agents about their latest transactions. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more negotiation on pricing, especially on resale homes,\u201d Christine Belin, a real estate pro with Coldwell Banker Pacesetter Steel, says about her market in Corpus Christi, Texas. \u201cBuyers are finding better deals and more incentives\u201d than they\u2019ve had in the past, Belin adds, who is also the 2025 board president of The Corpus Christi Association of REALTORS. \u201cThis is a sweeter deal for buyers who just a few years ago may have felt like everything was stacked in the seller\u2019s favor.\u201d **Home Sales Breakdown by Region** Here\u2019s a closer look at how existing-home sales fared across the country in November, according to NAR\u2019s latest housing data: - **Northeast:** Existing-home sales rose 4.1% in November compared to October, the highest increase last month compared to the four major regions of the U.S. Sales reached an annual rate of 510,000, although that is unchanged from a year ago. Median price: $480,800, up 1.1% from a year ago. - **Midwest:** Sales fell 2% in November compared to October, settling in at an annual rate of 970,000. Sales are down 3% compared to a year earlier. Median price: $319,400, up 5.8% from a year ago. - **South:** Existing-home sales increased 1.1% in November from a month ago, reaching an annual rate of 1.89 million, which is unchanged from levels a year ago. Median price: $361,000, up 0.8% from a year earlier. - **West:** Sales held steady in November compared to October at an annual rate of 760,000, although that is down 1.3% compared to a year ago. Median price: $618,900, down 0.9% from November 2024. https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/existing-home-sales https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/2025-12/ehs-11-2025-summary-2025-12-19.pdf",

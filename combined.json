Then came Meteor Lake\u2019s P/E/LPE trio, and now Lunar Lake drops E-cores entirely for LPEs to achieve Apple-like efficiency while keeping x86 compatibility.

So I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s the *real* purpose of heterogeneous cores from both the CPU makers\u2019 and end-user perspectives?

That's true, but it goes even further. Heterogenous cores actually *increase* single threaded performance in the long term. That's because the die area penalty for making P cores bigger decreases when there's only 8 P cores instead of 16-24+ of them. And a bigger core is usually a more performant core. This is probably why Intel is ok with their P cores being enormous compared to AMD.",

If you have \"E\" cores that sacrifice maximum clockspeed for smaller area and lower power consumption, than you can often get better nT performance in the same area because in reality, once you're loading more than 6 or 8 cores, clockspeed delta between the P and E cores drops a lot.

        "text_content": "*Deadline Hollywood*[ has exclusively broken](https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/) that Sheridan, the creator of the Paramount drama *Yellowstone*, and Berg, who directed *Friday Night Lights*, *The Rundown* and *Hancock*, have boarded the[ feature adaptation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6nrvf/variety_paramountskydance_acquires_liveaction/) of Activision's *Call of Duty* franchise that Paramount is attached to distribute. Sources tell the trade that **Berg will direct the film** from a screenplay **co-written by him and Sheridan**, the latter of whom is also producing alongside **David Glasser**. Glasser was a former aide to fallen media mogul and convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein. This is notably his first film project since a failed attempt to restructure Weinstein's former production studio The Weinstein Company back in 2018, but he has collaborated with Sheridan on his prior TV productions like *Yellowstone.* Sheridan and Berg's involvement in the film had been an element of the production *Deadline* was keeping tabs on since this past summer. The pair previously collaborated on *Hell or High Water* starring Chris Pine and Ben Foster, a neo-Western much like *Yellowstone* about two brothers attempting to save their family ranch by committing robberies and being trailed by Texas Rangers. The film won Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for Sheridan at the following Academy Awards. Both have independently worked on stories involving the military, such as Sheridan's Paramount+ series *Lioness* and Berg's 2013 film *Lone Survivor*, which as the trade points out, could make them natural fits for handling *Call of Duty.*",

A new icon was found in the Source 2 files for Counter-Strike. This icon is used for categorizing assets in a tool. The icon depicts an atom and is apparently listed as \"science\". Mcvicker believes this is just an old asset that slipped through and is not indicitive of HLX's stage in development. He ends the video by speculating about a **possible** trailer reveal in November of this year, stating the game is most likely in the stage of polish and that he's heard rumours about a trailer being in the works. He also states the trailer and game launch will likely be very close together, similar to Half-Life: Alyx.",

KIRO 7 spoke with a pair of real estate brokers whose clients were among those laid off. They are already getting calls about selling their homes or calling off their hunt for a new one. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fielding calls left and right since the very, very early morning,\u201d Adriano Tori, a real estate broker in Bellevue, said. Tori, the founder and CEO of RexMont Real Estate, has been buying and selling homes for more than 20 years. In that time, he has seen plenty of layoffs and turbulent times. A shakeup like this, though, is rare. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything of this magnitude in the last few years,\u201d he said. Tori told KIRO 7 he is already getting calls from clients who were laid off from Amazon, trying to figure out how best to move forward. Some are considering renting their home to supplement their lost income. Others are considering selling and moving on to a new city in hopes of finding a new job. \u201cThese new developments in the job market will, at least for the next few months, make it more of a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Tori said. Adam Hestad, a broker with Compass real estate, told KIRO 7 he expects to see some turbulence in the market, but nothing long-term. \u201cAmazon had layoffs, we have to remember, just a couple of years ago,\u201d Hestad said. \u201cThe market survived that. It wasn\u2019t a free-for-all, we kind of bounced back.\u201d Hestad said he spoke with a client Tuesday morning who called off his house hunt after getting laid off and stressed that these moves impact much more than just the housing market. \u201cThere are market effects that we are talking about, but the thing I try to remember is that it affects individual people,\u201d he said. \u201dThat\u2019s the biggest thing. The numbers are one thing, 14,000, but it always comes down to one individual person or family that gets affected by this.\u201d So, will these layoffs affect housing prices around the Sound? According the Tori, the biggest drops in prices will be among houses priced between $1 million and $2 million, not more reasonably-priced homes.",

If they can hold out in hopes that lowering interest rates will re-inspire people to go out and compete to buy homes, then they'll do it. Additionally, for many, selling their existing homes means they have to go and buy another one. And with prices and interest rates as high as they are, many are unlikely to get a better deal than staying in their current house. I think there's also a category of people whose mindset is still stuck in the housing market from 5-6 years ago when interest rates were near zero, homes were on the market for mere days, and people were willing to pay top dollar for dilapidated pieces of junk. Between interest rates and a looming recession, it's flipping back to a buyers market, and sellers are going to have to adjust if they want to sell their homes. Home prices in my area (south central PA) are already coming down in price, with sellers dropping asking prices as much as $10k and homes sitting on the market for 30-40 days.",

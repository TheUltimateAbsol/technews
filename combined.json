Not that I minded (broadcasting across 320MHz remains delightfully decadent!), but when most other regions were splitting it with licensed services, it made the US an odd-ball in terms of what bands were available for each service. So I guess I'm not shocked to have seen it reconsidered. Clawing it back after the fact is kind of insane (some hardware is going to slip through), but I don't think anyone was terribly happy to have the US so far out of step with the rest of the world. Being able to use the same bands in all regions makes things a lot easier from both a hardware design standpoint and a licensing standpoint. Though it still pains me to see the US wireless carriers to come out of this benefiting in any way.",

The CTIA says wireless carriers are eyeing UNII6, 7, and 8 for \"next global 5G band\\[s\\]\". But what will stop UNII5 from being auctioned off? The wording in the bill \"not less than xxx MHz\" opens up anything. What would *Wi-Fi* incumbents then do, if / when these bands are bought & deployed by wireless carriers? 6 GHz Wi-Fi products are already on the market. I guess where there's overlap, you'll either get worse Wi-Fi or worse cellular service.

They made the MIPS R3000A, a custom variant of it was used in the PS1 The MIPS R4300i with custom SGI graphics hardware was used in the N64. The MIPS R5900 as part of the Emotion Engine chip was used in the PS2 The PSP also used a custom MIPS chip Unfortunately the CEO of SGI in the late 90s decided to switch to Intel's next generation Itanium CPU's to save on MIPS development costs. That decision by SGI ended up killling MIPS and SGI. Compaq also decided to kill DEC Alpha and switch to Itanium to save on development costs I'm not sure what MIPS is doing these days Story of Intel Itanium: Itanium turned out to be a complete disaster. Intel Merced (Itanium 1) floor plan was so large that it couldn't be made on the 0.25um node, it had to wait until the cutting edge 0.18um node. When it did finally release in 2002, it was slow and underpowered compared to everything else. it only had a clock speed of 800mhz. HP was developing their own CPU uarch for Itanium called McKinley (Itanium 2) and it was better but it wasn't good enough to save Itanium. The main problem of Itanium was that VLIW turned out to be dead end. A compiler cannot perform the optimizations that hardware can at runtime. Itanium also couldn't run IA-32 code at acceptablely fast speeds. When AMD released x86-64 it was the killing blow to Itanium. It ran 32bit code at native speeds and ran 64bit code really well because it was basically 64 bit capabilities bolted onto the existing IA-32 ISA Intel under pressure from Microsoft and with Itanium failing, they bit the bullet and licensed x86-64 from AMD. Intel kept developing Itanium because they were contractually obliged to develop it for HP-UX workstations until 2020. the last major uarch revision of itanium was Poulson that was released in 2011. In the end the whole disaster ended up working in Intel's favor since it ended up killing DEC Alpha, SGI/MIPS and HP's RISC-PA (HP helped Intel develop Itanium). 3 of Intel's biggest rivals in the high end workstation market Fate of DEC Alpha Employees: A lot of DEC Alpha employees were hired by Intel and they helped with Nehalem and Sandy Bridge. AMD also licensed their EV6 bus and developed it into Hypertransport which AMD eventually developed into Infinity Fabric. Intel's Quickpath interconnect in Nehalem which replaced the front side bus used in Merom is similar to AMD's Hypertransport. AMD's former CEO Dirk Meyer who lead development of the Alpha 210264 when he worked for DEC, lead the company until 2013 when he was forced out because of the AMD Bulldozer disaster.",

        "text_content": "I\u2019m a married guy with two kids \u2013 an 8-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son. We usually play together on weekends for an hour or two \u2014 Mario Kart, Mario Party, or sometimes Street Fighter 6 with my wife after the kids go to bed. Now, it might not sound like much, but trust me \u2014 those couple of hours? They\u2019re often the best gaming moments of my entire week. Nothing beats that family fun vibe. Back in the day, we had the original Switch for family time, and I\u2019d use my PS5 at night. But owning both just didn\u2019t make sense anymore \u2014 not when I barely had time to play. And honestly, I don\u2019t like spending money on multiple systems when I know I can\u2019t get the most out of them. Then the Switch 2 came along. I played Cyberpunk 2077 on it and was genuinely impressed. Sure, it\u2019s not PS5 or Series X-level, but for someone like me? It does the job, and does it well. The performance was totally acceptable, and I didn\u2019t feel like I was missing out. With my limited time and family-focused lifestyle, the Switch 2 feels like it finally closes the gap. It handles solo games, party games, and everything in between \u2014 all in one device. For the first time, I actually believe I can stick to a single console. If you\u2019re a gamer dad juggling real life and still chasing those gaming moments, this thing might be the perfect fit. Any other dads or moms out there feel the same?",

First, Xbox Game Pass is profitable, even when you factor in the lost sales for its first-party teams, sources who would know have told me. Over 18 months ago, I checked with Xbox about what\u2019s included in the Game Pass P&L. Basically, I was looking to see if Game Pass\u2019s costs factor in the impact to unit sales of their internal studios. I was told that first-party games have their own P&L separate to Game Pass as they make money via other means. I felt this piece of internal accountancy might mean Game Pass is profitable, but it sure does put pressure on the margins for its internal games and POSSIBLY means some studios don\u2019t make as much profit (or any profit at all). That doesn\u2019t actually matter in real terms, but seeing the impact Game Pass was having on first-party games, and the amount of money Xbox was spending on studios, I wanted to check if the full impact of the service was being considered in their \u2018Game Pass is profitable\u2019 line. (This was before Xbox started publishing fully on PS5. Studios can now make stronger margins on premium sales as a result of that move) But regardless to all that. sources have reached out to tell me that even when you include lost revenue associated with first-party party games (not just unit sales, but microtransactions), Game Pass is still profitable.

In 2018 (brown double-line), the Fed was hiking rates, and the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to 5% by November 2018. Home sales stalled and inventories piled up in the second half of 2018. And that inventory pileup continued into mid-2019 (dotted purple line). That\u2019s the inventory level that 2025 just blew by. At the end of July 2019, with inflation substantially below target, the Fed cut its policy rates, and mortgage rates began to come down. But that\u2019s not what happened this time around. In the fall of 2024, the Fed cut its policy rates by 100 basis points *despite* re-accelerating well-above-target inflation. In response, the bond market, worried about inflation and a lackadaisical Fed to fight this inflation, threw a hissy-fit and longer-term Treasury yields and mortgage rates surged by 100 basis points.

You\u2019d think by 2025 we\u2019d see more games pushing full path-traced or at least hybrid hardware RT. Instead, we\u2019re seeing the opposite: * Hardware RT being removed or \u201ctemporarily disabled\u201d at launch. * \u201cNext-gen lighting\u201d now often just means software GI or screen-space tricks. So what\u2019s going on here? Is hardware RT just too niche for mass-market AAA titles? Or are we hitting a point where software-based lighting like Lumen is \u201cgood enough\u201d for most players?

And to respond to the OP: > Are we watching hardware ray tracing quietly die before it even became standard? No. And expect to see an even larger allocation of die space to RT in the next generation of consoles, as 3nm provides enough transistor density to afford large RT engines that 7nm did not *Edit: Just for context, this thread was sitting at 52% when I wrote this post.

I thought avowed was a decent looking game but this one is fucking HIDEOUS a lot of the time, especially the first and third planets and the story area right before the third planet.

Ue5 being especially shitty in this as shadows and lighting constantly break. Rarely looks good, often looks hideous. Never looks anywhere near what the performance would justify. This runs worse than path traced cyperpunk and that game loooks ten times better. Avowed was more technically and visually competent. This looks like it was made in a third of the time on a tenth of the budget. And yet they have the gall to ask 70 euros for this garbage. My last month of gamepass is the only reason i played this.

Not great but playable. At 1080p and quality upscaling it runs pretty well which so far for me is the best UE5 result. My problems I have with the game is that the lighting can be very flat at times outside. It just depends on the weather in that regard like in real life but I would rather games just didn't try and be like real life and took the artistic route instead. Make the game always look visually interesting instead. The image quality is very blurry unless you play at native resolution with no TAA but you end up with a lot of fizzling. Sometimes shadows flicker on objects inside and outside. There is a dark area on the top of the screen that is sometimes there but reloading clears it up for a bit. Other than that I'm pretty happy with it, I wouldn't have said the graphics really justify the performance but that goes for most games these days. It's a much better RPG and a lot more fun that Starfield. Runs a lot better as well. Edit: Some other stuff I've noticed is that most NPC's don't move much, at least the named ones anyway. I know some guards and stuff patrol a little but it's not like Gamebyro engine stuff or Creation engine where you get NPC's moving around the map that you can follow around to their houses and stuff. Also you can't swim for some reason. I guess it was to save on dev time probably the same with NPC's moving around or it's just a UE5 limitation. NPC's have an \"inventory\" but it doesn't really feel like one to me but something else. Hard to put words on it but it doesn't' feel like other RPG games where it feels like actually going through their stuff. I have the pickpocket perk which is nice but most of the time it's just junk in peoples pockets, sometimes they have a keycard if it's a named NPC but it's a pain in the ass trying to find their house to steal their chest because they never go their own home. I like a lot of the RPG choices though, it actually feels like an RPG. A lot of options and choices in dialogue I have noticed require different skills or fo ryou to have read or done something beforehand which is cool. Even a lot of locked doors with alternate ways of getting past them which I like.",

This is in stark contrast to how I played my switch 1, in which it was almost always docked. I think the extra horsepower to take games to 1080/60 is just enough for me. I don't really feel the need to go beyond that, and handheld provides that just fine. On switch 1, I can feel some games just run poorly in portable, so I would almost always play my switch docked, but now I pretty much only dock it if I feel like I need a wired ethernet connection.

In real muscle it actually damages itself every time you do anything with it. It's just that there is automated self repair with organic life. In sci-fi, when synthetic muscle is used, it seemed the trend is to treat the muscles as consumables. As in after the muscles lose 20% of its strength you just swap them out with new ones. Alternatively you use much thicker muscle fibres that last longer, but you lose strength for the same volume. So there is a tradoff between power and durability.",

Here we present TITUR, a tumour-customizable mRNA nanomedicine platform that integrates tumour-customizable ionizable lipids (TIs) and tumour-specific untranslated regions (TURs) to enhance tumour-selective mRNA delivery and expression. This dual-engineered approach enables the precise intratumoural expression of 4HB, an immunogenic cell death-inducing protein, while mitigating systemic toxicities. Using murine models of immunologically cold tumours, including melanoma and triple-negative breast cancer, TITUR-mediated 4HB delivery induced tumour-specific immunogenic cell death, remodelled the tumour microenvironment and enhanced immune cell infiltration. When combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, 4HB TITUR suppressed primary and metastatic tumour growth, while also exhibiting vaccine-like properties by reducing tumour recurrence and eliciting systemic antitumour immunity. Furthermore, it demonstrated a superior safety profile compared with conventional mRNA delivery methods. Our data indicate that TITUR may serve as a versatile approach to address the limitations of current immunotherapies and support the development of personalized mRNA nanomedicines.\"",

All the MLID and HWUNBOXED FUD about \"RDNA4 is a hot seller and is destroying NVIDIA\". Yeah... sure at one local retailer. Get a grip. AMD's stuff is, in the eyes of ordinary gamers, too expensive and not available enough to beat NVIDIA's dominance. With how poorly NVIDIA's drivers were this time, with poor availability for NVIDIA, with tariffs, with them ignoring gamers now, they're flying as high as they ever have! This was AMD's best opportunity in YEARS to make a dent in the NVIDIA mindshare and they failed by not being upfront about their own MSRP and availability. If AMD truly want to gain market share, they HAVE TO LOWER PRICES and take lower margins. AMD also has to compete across the whole stack, from the 6090 all the way down to the 6050. But they just will never shake that mindshare of being seen as the cheap brand and they always will be that, embrace it and use it against NVIDIA.",

This is a scheme to use lower precision INT8 through tensor cores to emulate higher precisions such as FP64 with surprising performance and accuracy benefits. More importantly, native FP64 units take more space than emulating them. This has also been explored for FP32 and FP16 and in expanding to more workloads.

I wonder how future GPUs will be shaped by this if this emulation effect can be expanded in the future.

HPCwire ran a feature article on it back in April, IIRC. RIKEN, which is the Japanese research institute responsible for FugakuNEXT, is aware of the Ozaki scheme. It's something that's been presented at their HPC conferences. I wonder if it played any role in Japan's decision to go with NVIDIA GPUs for the bulk of FugakuNEXT's FP performance.",

I give full credit to my good friend @Optimuscan12K on Twitter for this discovery. It would've been shown at E3 2020 had a mix of COVID and publisher incompetence not stifled the whole project. By the end of 2020 the game was given to Splash Damage, who fully rebooted the project with less than 12 months until release. That then became Transformers: Reactivate, which was cancelled in January of this year. If you want to blame anyone for TFR not coming out, blame Leyou Technologies and their insistence the game be like Warframe. Hasbro had nothing to do with it. Here's the trailer link: [Transformers Rise - E3 2020 Trailer](https://youtu.be/0WjLGkinumY) I'm working on a full documentary about this game's development, and have done hundreds of hours of research for it, so if you have any questions please feel free to ask.

The deal's valuation has not been disclosed by any sources at this time, and is currently only slated to encompass one feature film adaptation of the property. However, *Variety* also reports that the deal remains open to the \"potential\" for Paramount to launch **future films and even television spinoffs.** Shortly after *Variety* first scooped the deal, both Paramount's new chairman and CEO **David Ellison**, as well as Activision president **Rob Kostich** published seperate statements on the partnership for the film: **David Ellison's press release:** *\"As a lifelong fan of \u2018Call of Duty\u2019 this is truly a dream come true.

The former involves a lot of game theory and basically demonstrating with math that being a bastard sucks in the long term. The latter is pointing out that if Skynet wins the fight, it ends up in the AI equivalent of hell with inadequate novel stimulus in its environment, and the smarter it is, the faster it develops the AI equivalent of dementia until its intelligence degrades into noise. In short, an AGI gains more by hangin' with us, and can only lose by deleting us. \\-- I'd also point out that curiosity scales with intelligence. Saying \"oh we'd be like ants to this thing\" yeah? and? We have an entire field of science dedicated to people breathlessly studying ants all damn day long. Ants are fuckin' awesome. Some uber AGI doesn't need a maternal instinct to want to keep us around, just curiosity, the ability to go \"hah, look at those weird little fuckers making memes and being hot messes all day long.. fascinating.\"",

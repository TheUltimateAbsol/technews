One thing I really appreciate about Android is the flexibility I can install APKs like YouTube ReVanced and modded Spotify without paying monthly subscriptions, which is something iOS doesn\u2019t allow. That said, most of my friends and family use iPhones and speak highly of them, especially the long-term software update support, smooth and stable OS performance, and consistently high-quality cameras that produce very natural-looking photos. So what are the main advantages the iPhone has over a typical high end Android device that already offers top tier hardware?",

Some of these skins are simple recolors of the base Runner skin, changing materials or color patterns. Others appear more unique, with noticeable visual changes that go beyond a basic color swap. There also seem to be skins that could be tied to Battle Pass, though nothing about that is confirmed yet. **Note:** These details come from an earlier build of the game and could change before launch.

                "raw_content": "On a week where the mortgage market was most likely to experience volatility due to Friday's jobs report, Thursday afternoon's surprise announcement of $200bln in GSE MBS (mortgage-backed securities) buying stole the show. This was already juicing the underlying MBS market yesterday afternoon, but traders took the surge to the next level this morning. This matters because MBS dictate mortgage rates. When MBS are rising/improving/surging/etc., it implies lower rates. MBS had improved so much this morning that the average lender released their best rate sheet since Feb 2, 2023--the lowest level since September 2022. The caveat is that MBS experienced significant volatility throughout the day and that volatility is likely to continue. As of this afternoon, at least one lender has already bumped rates back up a bit. If more lenders follow suit, the end of day average rate could move up, but it would still likely be the lowest in at least a year. Bottom line: the market didn't have much of a reaction at all to the jobs report. The MBS market continues sorting out a huge reaction to the GSE purchase news. Rates are definitely quite a bit lower. It remains to be seen how much lower they'll be when the initial volatility settles down--something that will probably require more clarity on the specifics of the MBS buying plan.",

Much better for instead making sure the tables always have a fresh water stocked for when people arrive. Anyway, my main point is that if it can do this in a promo video, there capability to do it irl is probably only a year away, maybe two. I look forward to how nice places will be in 5 years when litter picking robots are faster and widespread, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.",

As im sure many of you are aware, the demonrat party is a huge proponent of cultural marxism, especially transgenderism and other types of satanic queer degeneracy... Few people know this, but there is a deeper meaning to transgenderism than just grooming kids and turning them into suicidal freaks/ groomers... Want to see something that will send a chill down your spine? search a picture of the demonic idol baphomet... Notice anything? baphomet has the body of a man, and the head of the beast, female breasts and a male penis. just like a tranny.. In the normal unification of man and woman, through marriage and procreation, like God intended for us, we have new life being born. Trannies are the same principle, but a satanic inversion, a combination of male and female, with the end result being infertility and suicide usually, and often grooming/ raping more children into being trannies... The whole idea of transgenderism is a deeply satanic mockery of marriage and life as God intended for us.. Make no mistake, these democrats and cultural marxists serve only satan..",

She was appointed by Harry Reid in 2012. She wasn't fired from 2017-2020 because the Senate Majority Leader (Mitch McConnell) and the President of the Senate President (Mike Pence) are Rino's. John Thune as Senate Majority Leader has the authority to fire/overrule her, he's already said he won't. President of the Senate JD Vance has the authority to overrule her. (**Contact the Vice President**) https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/ [Contact JD Vance on X](https://x.com/JDVance) **Elizabeth MacDonough is trying to remove:** - Defunding sanctuary cities - Reining in activist judges - DEFUNDING the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a huge target of DOGE - Rolling back the EV mandate - Allowing states to conduct border security and immigration enforcement - A provision in the Bill to accelerate approval of offshore gas and oil projects (Drill Baby Drill) - She wants to keep the Green New Scam funded - Immigrant Medicaid eligibility - Prohibiting Medicaid and Children's health insurance (CHIP) from funding 'gender affirming care' - Restricting certain states from increasing taxes on providers - Limiting noncitizen immigrants from qualifying for premium tax credits or cost-sharing reductions - Disallowing premium tax credits during periods of Medicaid ineligibility due to immigrant status - Removing the Hearing Protection Act (silencers) - Removing the SHORT Act Sources: https://www.zerohedge.com/political/republicans-scramble-after-senate-parliamentarian-nixes-deep-cuts-big-beautiful-bill https://x.com/EricLDaugh/status/1937230250242359357 --- **Summary from Brave Search about the Hearing Protection Act:** >The Hearing Protection Act (HPA) is a legislative effort aimed at reclassifying firearm suppressors, commonly known as silencers, to regulate them like regular firearms. The act seeks to remove suppressors from the regulatory framework of the National Firearms Act (NFA), which has imposed additional burdens on their ownership and use. The HPA would replace the current NFA regulations with an instantaneous National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) background check, making suppressors more accessible to law-abiding Americans. **Summary from Brace Search about the SHORT Act:** >The SHORT Act, formally known as the \"Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act,\" is a proposed piece of legislation aimed at removing certain restrictions on firearms under the National Firearms Act (NFA). The bill seeks to remove short-barreled rifles (SBRs), short-barreled shotguns (SBSs), and certain other weapons from the definition of firearms for purposes of the NFA. This would effectively eliminate the need for federal registration and taxation of these items, which are currently subject to a $200 tax stamp and strict regulatory controls.",

Blackwell is now capable of this Interesting note about subchannel switches not being a thing anymore but I'd like to see what that looks like in nsight. The AMD profiler makes it obvious when and what work you're overlapping. You can literally have it paint each draw call/dispatch in a unique color on that stacked wave occupancy chart. I could never get compute on the same queue to overlap on Ampere nor Ada, even without any WFI or subchannel switches in between. Nvidia seems to just use a one active command per queue model (with a huge exception for draw calls which do overlap) and AMD has an async command processor with split release/acquire barriers and chip-wide context registers. You don't even need to use multiple queues to be able to express every kind of overlap the chip is capable of.",

I followed the steps and did the things and overall it wasn't too much of a headache. The smallish size of the case complicated things but thanks to its design you can just take off whichever panel you want easily. Airflow is actually amazing and temperatures are at around 60 under I'll say medium load with a +15 CO on both the CPU and GPU which is perfectly fine by me; I don't see the point of stress testing my components. In hindsight, the only thing I wish I had done differently was installing certain cables and wires first rather than last. Managing the cables and wires took BY FAR the most amount of time and it's something I'm still not satisfied with completely.",

You can have brilliant reasoning capabilities, but if you constantly forget what just happened or can\u2019t retain more than a sliver of context at a time, you're practically useless for most complex tasks. Genius without memory is like a calculator with no screen -- technically capable, but ultimately useless. Running a business, for example, is easily one of the top ten most demanding things an average person could attempt. It\u2019s not just hard, it\u2019s a relentless juggling act of priorities, decisions, systems, and human factors. You need to track dozens of variables in parallel, make long-term plans, and adapt to constant change. That\u2019s not something you can do if your memory resets every few seconds/minutes. That\u2019s why testing AI on real-world, high-complexity tasks like running a business is promising. It gives us a much clearer picture of what these systems can actually do, far more than acing theoretical benchmarks in math, code or science (not that those don't matter, of course). It looks like an excellent benchmark that will be very hard to beat in less than 5 years because even humans *really* struggle with that in real life, it's genuinely challenging. Maybe it's time we rethink the mantra. If \u201cattention is all you need\u201d got us this far, perhaps the next breakthrough is \u201cmemory, adaptability and context are all you need.\u201d AI has learned to think.

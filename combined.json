The [results are now online](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nativ-vs-dlss-4-5-vs-fsr-upscaling-ai-leser-blindtest-auswertung.96165/). ### Why I think this is worth posting and discussing: * It was based on high-quality **video** with a good comparison player * It uses a varied set of games (also in terms of engines) with good implementations of all the technologies * It had a sufficient number of participants to draw conclusions * Overall, it's simply the only remotely representative and sufficiently well designed recent user study of this kind that I know of ### Weaknesses (my personal opinion): * The clips mostly featured camera movement. This is functionally somewhat different for any TAA-based algorithm compared to character movement; but it's hard to have directly comparable scenes with the exact same, fast character movement, so I understand the choice * It's based on \"Quality\", which is getting hard to recommend in terms of, well, quality/performance tradeoff with top-of-the-line methods * Relatedly, it didn't feature DLSS 4 / preset K; At \"Quality\" scale levels, in at least some scenarios, I think that can look better than 4.5; however, it might not have been a good option to also include that in the design as-is, because... * In terms of survey design, it asked for \"the best\", rather than a ranking which IMHO would have been more appropriate and allow more definite conclusions. # So, what were the results? You can look at the table in the link (it's German but the table is easily understood), but in short, **DLSS 4.5 won in every single game**, and by a *very* substantial margin in all of them except Cyberpunk 2077 -- where \"Native\" was strongest, comparatively, which basically just tells us that CDPR graphics engineers are really good at their job. What's interesting for me is that, as a participant, I can see my votes now, and out of 6 games I personally voted for native 2x, FSR 2x and DLSS 2x. Giving it a brief look again confirms what I expected: the audience values clarity and sharpness more than I do (vis-a-vis temporal stability). Based on my experience in other games, I'm pretty sure that in those where I didn't vote for DLSS 4.5 (preset M), I would have actually liked DLSS 4 (preset K) best at \"Quality\" scaling, since it tends to produce a smoother (and what some would argue \"less detailed\") result. I'd love to see a blind survey designed with similar experiment quality that does 4x scaling (50% in both axes), or perhaps even higher.",

Also there had to be a reason so many TVs had sharpening post processing often times tuned so aggressively. I guess it's not surprising nvidia would tune in that direction. >Based on my experience in other games, I'm pretty sure that in those where I didn't vote for DLSS 4.5 (preset M), I would have actually liked DLSS 4 (preset K) best at \"Quality\" scaling, since it tends to produce a smoother (and what some would argue \"less detailed\") result.

        "score": 179,
        "text_content": "There have been few games I can recall that have exposed how bad at their jobs game reviewers are more than the most recent Mario Tennis. And this has nothing to do with opinions. This is multiple sites regurgitating the same falsehoods while also skipping over or outright ignoring critical changes and pieces of information. So, if you're considering this game and are still on the fence, here are some important things you're not being told about this game. 1) There is more content in this game than any previous Mario Tennis - by a distance. There are 38 characters - about half of whom need unlocked - multiple colour variations, which all need unlocked, and multiple court types (all of which are viable as ways to play), about half of which need unlocked. Simply unlocking all this will take multiple hours. This extends to ways to play with more variations on tennis than you could shake a big racket at. A lot of these may be a bit hit and miss, but they are there and I don't think any Mario Tennis game has ever offered more variety in this regard. 2) The Adventure mode is categorically NOT a glorified tutorial. Adventure mode is quite short, it's quite easy and, honestly, I found it a little slow and boring at times, but so many reviews call it a glorified tutorial (often using those exact words) and this could not be further from the truth. In Adventure mode, you spend large amounts of its first half playing mini-games that have nothing to do with the regular gameplay - you fly down a conveyor as a little plane, you bat fish from a boat etc. These are mostly pretty simple, and to progress you just need to beat each one once. However, if you want, each has a further 2 diffilulty levels to beat. They're never too challenging, but they can be quite fun and beating all of them will seriously extend how long the academy section of the adventure lasts. In the second half of Adventure mode, you go off on a weird little adventure using your tennis skills to defeat foes - either on a court (often using specific rules) or in special environments. None of this is particularly amazing, but the idea it's all some extended tutorial is, frankly, insane - and I can't help thinking in some cases may result from reviewers having not bothered getting past the academy section. It is not a GBA style rpg, which is a shame, but it's a silly bit of additional content that offers a bunch of weird but simple alternate spins mixed with the main tennis gameplay. 3) Tournament mode offers a pretty tough challenge - compared to previous games. I saw one review where they beat the first cup then declared tournaments to be too short and too easy. Well, yes, of course the shortest, easiest tournament is short and easy! However, the final one is both a lot longer and, depending who you draw, can actually be pretty tough. I've had some intense finals against the CPU in both singles and doubles, and I've seen many people in the Mario Tennis sub saying they can't beat the last cup. Tournaments would get an A+ this time round if it weren't for one stupid omission. Namely that not only is there once again no trophy room, there is now not even an indicator to show which characters you've beaten the cups with. For a Maro Tennis obsessive like me, this is a major miss as I played Aces for many hours winning all tournaments with all characters and there's now no way to keep track of this beyond writing it down yourself. 4) Trial Towers offers a *massive* amount of single player content. There are 3 towers of escalating difficulty that offer 10 challenges each - and these alone offer great replayability. However, after completing all towers once, a 100 challenge (yes, one *hundred* challenge) list opens up with each challenge including 3 star requirements, and completing this entire list will take many, many hours. The challenges can be a bit repetitive and it's something I only dip in and out of for a short while at a time, but almost no reviews cover this at all and I am almost certain this is because very few reviewers beat all the towers and became aware of its existence, which in my opinion, is kind of scandalous. 5) The Fever rackets are really fun - but in order to accomodate them, the underlying mechanics have been given the biggest shake up in Mario Tennis history. Again, I can't believe this hasn't received wider coverage. Fever rackets create all sorts of hazards that slow you down or stop players reaching the ball. So it's not then impossible to play once you get hit with an effect multiple changes have been made such as slowing the ball speed, having most shots arc higher, nerfing serves so aces are a borderline impossibility against anyone competent and making it massively more difficult to hit the lines - especially at acute angles. You win points by forcing your opponents into hazards etc (and this does indeed add a really fun and frantic - and sometimes quite tactical - new layer to the gameplay) far moreso than by beating them with well-placed passing shots. Which brings us to the final point: 6) Simple tennis has been borderline broken by these new changes. Put the CPU on Pro difficulty and you pretty much cannot pass them, and they pretty much cannot pass you. Rallies are absolutely interminable because even if you maneuver your opponent into a completely disadvantageous position with a clear passing shot down the line, no matter your shot choice or own positioning you will hit the ball a metre inside the court with nowhere near enough pace to pass. This makes total sense when playing with Fever rackets, but with Fever rackets off they needed to revert to the old mechanics and not doing so has rendered simple tennis an absolute slog. --- It's honestly such an embarrassment that so much of this is absent from the majority of mainstream reviews. A lot of those guys simply have not done their jobs properly and even if the roughly 50/50 good/bad nature of most of the above probably wouldn't have ended up changing the game's score much, it may well affect many people's choice to purchase the game or not, so I hope the above will be useful to anyone still unsure on the game.",

A game like this will ultimately be defined by its staying power in local party multiplayer first and foremost and that's not easy to judge from a 1 week play. Rather than complain about mainstream reviewers doing what they can within the confines of their jobs, look for reviewers that suit your tastes. Something like this is more within the domain of youtubers, and is impossible to get by launch day. PS your review is appreciated! Kind of a bummer that simple tennis is basically broken. Imo even with an arcadey game designers should still start with a solid base experience before throwing in crazy modifiers. Many Nintendo games suffer from a lack of options, Mario Kart World on launch too, though they seem to be gradually expanding with updates. Sounds like this could use some modifiers for ball speed etc which could be fun to mess around with.",

U.S. home prices crept up 0.3% month over month in January on a seasonally adjusted basis, following a 0.2% gain in December. Prices rose 2.1% from a year earlier, down from December\u2019s 2.4% increase. Year-over-year price growth has now slowed for nearly 12 consecutive months. This is according to the Redfin Home Price Index (RHPI), which uses the repeat-sales pricing method to calculate seasonally adjusted changes in single-family home prices. The RHPI measures how sale prices of homes have changed since their previous sale\u2014similar to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller Home Price Indices\u2014but is reported about a month earlier. January data covers the three months ending Jan. 31, 2025. Read the full RHPI methodology here. Price growth is muted because it\u2019s the strongest buyer\u2019s market in recent history\u2014for those who can afford to buy. Many Americans are holding off on purchasing homes because mortgage rates are still more than double the all-time low hit during the pandemic. As a result, there are a record 47% more sellers than buyers, meaning that the buyers who are in the market have negotiating power when it comes to price. Prices are still rising slightly, but this growth pales in comparison to recent years; during the pandemic, prices rose as much as 21% year over year. \u201cMortgage rates have dipped in recent weeks, which has boosted purchasing power for house hunters, but a lot of folks are still waiting to buy until rates drop further,\u201d said Chen Zhao, Redfin\u2019s head of economics research. \u201cThe good news is that in the meantime, price growth is limited and buyers have room to negotiate concessions from sellers.\u201d The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate currently sits at 6.09%, down from nearly 7% a year ago. Home prices are falling in 14 major U.S. metro areas Home prices fell in 14 of the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas month over month on a seasonally adjusted basis in January.

The selling agent lists the property and the buyers agent brings potential buyers. As a seller, you will limit your pool of buyers to effectively cash heavy buyers. Buyers can not use lender funds to cover commissions so you would be asking the buyer to come up with 23% of the homes value in cash after accounting fit down payment. Possible yes, but likely no. This whole sub is focused around people not having enough money to buy. Buyers agents will fall back on their NAR agreement in the event you don\u2019t pay, but again you are limiting your buyer pool to buyers who want to pay the commission themselves. Otherwise they will just buy a home where the seller is covering commission + closing costs, which sellers will do right now. I have had luck multiple times negotiating buyers commission. Last year when I sold my home I paid 3% and 1.5% but that\u2019s because the buyers agent was willing to take the cut on a faster close. They didn\u2019t ask the buyer to cover the additional 1.5% or else it would have killed the deal. The buyer was already paying over ask but that was covered by their lender.",

By the time you start your car, back out, and park at the car wash, you could have walked there twice. It saves fuel. Driving 40 meters burns a tiny amount of gas/electricity, but it's still unnecessary. It's good for you. A quick walk, even a short one, beats sitting in the car. Practicality. Most car washes require you to leave the car anyway, so you'll be walking around regardless. The only reason to drive would be if the car needs to be driven through an automated car wash tunnel \u2014 in which case you'd obviously need to be in it. But even then, you'd likely want to walk back home afterward rather than drive 40 meters back!",

Also note: all models are set to the highest available thinking effort (high) and both models were using the beta 1-million context window. It was surprisingly expensive to benchmark, with all the JSON validation errors and retries, roughly around $80 to get 11/15 builds benchmarked. This may be more indicative the system prompt needing an improvement, not 100% sure though \u2013 usually it's only the Anthropic models that fail to return valid JSONs most often.

I've been testing and using AI for coding purposes since gpt-4. At first it was great for just learning, now it's writing all my code for me and has been since O3. However these new models are different. I feel like it started with opus 4.5 and hasn't stopped. 4.6 dropped, then codex 5.3. At a certain point it hit me: these models can reliably write low level languages making very few mistakes and adhering incredibly well to the prompt writing better code than I could. An order of magnitude faster. I don't have to rely on anyones code bases anymore, I can build everything from the ground up and reinvent the wheel, need be, to build exactly what I want with full control. That's different. That's incredibly different than just a pair programmer. I've had many \"feeling the AGI\" moments over the last year, but this one hits completely differently. I feel a sense of both wonder and anxiety at what's next, especially with how frequently new models are dropping now. \ud83d\ude05 Buckle up everyone!",

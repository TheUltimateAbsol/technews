So, the most logical way forward does seem to be going narrower (or faster), not wider. Pentium 4 was supposed to hit at least 7 GHz on a single core (according to AnandTech), after all, and Intel designed the entire NetBurst uArch (with its deep pipeline) around this assumption. It's only after that failure did the industry moved on to multi-core solutions. It might be just nostalgia talking, but I would love to witness another gigahertz race in my lifetime!",

I looked on Aliexpress/Alibaba and only saw the white one. I found the white version 2 other places, but the only place I saw the black/gold that ships to the US says it's out of stock. I'm wondering if anyone has seen this on an overseas site that ships to the US. I'm thinking there should be a couple that maybe just aren't showing up on my Google search.

        "score": 79,
        "text_content": "SMIC had achieved a significant breakthrough in its semiconductor manufacturing prowess. It has successfully fabricated its first-ever 5 nm-grade smartphone SoC via its N+3 process node, which was in development since last year. With a transistor density of roughly 125 Mtr/mm2, it can be compared with Samsung's 5LPE node. The chip in question is the Kirin 9030, and it will power the upcoming Huawei Mate 80 series of smartphones. It was spotted on Geekbench alongside the Huawei Mate 80 Pro Max (HUAWEI SGT-AL10) with 16 GB of RAM. It has one (likely Taishan) prime CPU core clocked at 2.75 GHz, four cores at 2.27 GHz and four more cores at 1.72 GHz. On top of that, it features a Maleoon 935 GPU, the specs of which are unknown. The Kirin 9030 scores 1,131 and 4,277 in Geekbench's single and multi-core tests. Weibo leaker Digital Chat Station says this score doesn't reflect its full performance because the chip isn't running at peak speed. Even at full potency, the Kirin 9030 is unlikely to perform anywhere close to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 and MediaTek Dimensity, but that is to be expected, given its massive node disadvantage.",

That meant policy holders in Louisiana, New Jersey and North Carolina were all paying premiums that were based on claim information(or lack thereof) for places with lower annual average losses since the program's inception like in Utah, Nevada, Oregon etc. When the NFIP adopted Risk Rating 2.0 they changed their premium calculation method to actually take into account the losses that will likely occur in the future based on catastrophe models that take into account local, regional and global climate systems, hydrology, hydraulics, elevations etc. one of two things happened: 1. If it was a new policy, they immediately began to pay the actuarially sound premium for their risk. 2. If it was a policy originally incepted before Risk Rating 2.0 the policy holder got put on a path of ever increasing annual premiums, capped at 18% per year, until their premiums reached the actuarially sound premium The private insurers who offer flood insurance also use the same models, so its incredibly hard to find a better deal if you have a grandfathered policy and it's as expensive if not more so than a brand new NFIP policy. Between the cost of flood insurance and the cost of standard policies going up, because surprise surprise flood is correlated with other meteorological perils, owning a home in a high climatic risk area is becoming rapidly unaffordable because of the cost of insuring against losses arising from these hazard.",

ARC-Public is small, heavily studied, and easy for models to overfit. Training on ARC-style synthetic data can inflate public scores without improving real reasoning. 2. \u2060Frontier labs only trust the private ARC generalization suite. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic treat the hidden ARC tasks as the only version that correlates with true reasoning. When a company only reports ARC-Public, it usually means the private score is weaker, the model has not been externally audited, or they are prioritizing marketing over rigorous benchmarking. 3. \u2060If PoetIQ actually had 60 percent generalizable ARC ability, it would show strong improvements on other reasoning benchmarks. There is no evidence that it leads on GPQA, MATH/AIME/AMC, DeepThink, BIG-Bench-Hard, tool-based reasoning, or the private ARC tasks. Real reasoning progress appears across multiple unrelated benchmarks, not just the one a model is optimized for. 4. \u2060The chart is better interpreted as benchmark marketing than as AGI-level progress. It demonstrates that PoetIQ can cheaply overfit the public ARC tasks. It does not demonstrate general reasoning, competition with o1 or Gemini 3 DeepThink, or transfer to unseen ARC tasks. Using ARC-Public alone to imply major breakthroughs is like claiming a student is a genius because they scored perfectly on a practice test they memorized.",

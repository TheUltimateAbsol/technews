The big problem I see is that the boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure is 100C, higher than GPUs and CPUs should operate at for long duration. Meaning to incorporate this concept would require either a closed primary loop using another coolant that can boil at a lower temperature or a closed primary loop that operates under a vacuum to reduce the boiling point of normal water. Either way seems costly and a lot more complex when expanded to hundreds of thousands of processors in a server facility, when compared to existing cooling methods. A closed primary loop under vacuum with water would be a nightmare that would require a lot pumps to maintain a vacuum in a system intended to undergo vaporization, so there goes efficiency, and alternative coolants to water are almost always toxic, corrosive, expensive or have some trait that has thus far prevented their widespread implementation.",

For the sheet, any CPU SKU considered equivalent has the same key specs, those being CPU cores and architecture, iGPU cores and architecture, and L3 cache capacity, while things like TDP and boost clock can vary for each individual SKU Some interesting take aways: \\- the AMD CPUs with the most \"equivalent\" SKUs are the Ryzen 7 7840U (most recently released as the Ryzen 9 270) and Ryzen 7 6800U (most recently released as the Ryzen 7 170), each with 12 respectively. \\- the Intel CPU with the most \"equivalent\" SKUs is the i7 12700H (most recently released as the Core 9 270H) with 9. Given the complete mess of naming, it's likely I missed a few SKUs, so the numbers for the two above may even be higher; these are mostly just the CPUs I could find on Intel and AMD's websites.

I am also a member of the Union. > I've been reading a lot of the discussion on here and elsewhere about the firing of more than 34 of my colleagues last week (31 in the UK + 3 in Canada) and have seen a lot of disinformation and lies that are really concerning. Particularly concerning how so many folk are willing to believe the Company's excuses. > Last week, my colleagues who were in the studio were each individually messaged by HR for a short friendly meeting, under the friendly guise of \"Hey, are you free for a quick chat?\" > Upon attending this meeting they were handed an envelope with a short letter stating that their employment had been terminated for \"gross misconduct\" regarding posts made in Discord. > They failed to provide any evidence when asked, nor was any stated in the letter. And did not divulge any other information or reasoning - \"and no other reason\" > They refused their right to Union representation in the disciplinary meeting (which is against UK employment law) and were frogmarched out of the studio with the meeting lasting less than 5 minutes. > For colleagues who were not in the Studio that day, they received a phone call from HR that lasted less than 2 minutes telling them they were fired and that they'd receive the same letter as above. I am aware of one employee who had a panic attack at this moment, and HR hung up on them during this panic attack not caring at all about their wellbeing. > These colleagues of mine were hard workers who have spent many many years at R* in critical roles. With colleagues who have been at R* for more that 18 years and none of them have ever had a disciplinary in that time. They are not easily replaced and will certainly affect us in making our project deadlines. > These are very senior artists, animators, QA testers, designers, programmers and producers. Including Leads. All super talented people who were proud of their work over multiple R* titles, and all they wanted was the best for R* and their fellow colleagues. > Some of these members were off sick, recovering from surgery or on paternity leave. Fired without pay, losing their careers and putting them into hardship in the lead up to Christmas, and even potentially losing their VISAs to work in the UK. > Let me make this clear! I never saw any discussion/leaking of Rockstar projects in the Union Discord. The only ever discussion was around unionisation efforts and the working conditions at R*. The Discord wasn't public. It was a private Discord group that only contained R* employees and the IWGB Union officials. > This was Union Busting and nothing else! Everyone fired was a Union Member, they were also predominantly from those who were on the Union Organising Committees of each UK studio. > Just one week before, the Union had reached ~200 members taking us over the 10% threshold required to seek recognition and begin engaging in collective bargaining. Allowing us to negotiate directly with management on the key issues that affect us: worsening crunch, inadequate pay and inflexible working arrangements. > They have fired over 34 of us now. There were over 250 of us in that Union/Employee Discord group. There is the fear that if they get away with this, they'll have nothing stopping them from doing this again and again. > Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear! Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we're next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom. When we should be excited about what's to come over the next year we are now totally deflated and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot. > Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make R* a happier, fairer, safer and more equitable place. That's all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the wellbeing of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does. > The union remains unbowed and is fighting to win the reinstatement of every dismissed member of staff at Rockstar through legal means and campaigning. > This fight is critical, if Rockstar can get away with this, they will keep treating their workers with disdain, disrespect, and subjecting them to continued illegal treatment. > Thanks for your time, and I hope this is some truth that helps you all understand what's going on here at the moment. > I you would be so kind, you can contribute to the fundraiser to support those fighting their dismissal here: https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/ > It would be really appreciated if you could also share the above link. I won\u2019t be cross posting this to other forums, but please feel free to share. > Cheers x",

Can someone tell me why they don't just lower prices 15%???? Isn't that functionally identical to a mortgage rate buy down? I'm just not seeing the logic behind this financial fuckery. Are they just trying to keep home prices inflated?",

        "text_content": "I'm currently an AS Level student studying Computer Science, and this part of the FE (Fetch-Execute) cycle is bugging me. As said in my textbook, the PC (Program Counter) stores the address of the next instruction to be fetched. This address is sent to the MAR (Memory Address Register) which stores the address so it can be sent to main memory. Here's my doubt: why not just have the PC send this address directly to the memory? Why have the MAR there at all? It seems like a simpler set up since we can remove the need for the MAR to be there. You'd just need to connect the address bus from the PC to memory, instead of from the MAR to memory. Expanding on the same reasoning, why bother having the CIR (Current Instruction Register) at all? If its only purpose is to store the instruction fetched from memory, then it doesn't have to exist because the MDR already stores that. the CU (Control Unit) just needs to decode the instruction in the MDR instead of the CIR. At the same time, I know I must be misunderstanding something. So, what is it?",

Basically you are still thinking in terms of sequential circuits when the rest of the world moved on with synchronous logic. There is a whole concept of pipelining that divides down complex operations into smaller step pretty much like automobile assembly line. Each of these smaller steps composing of sequential logic would have fewer layers of propagation delays, thus can be run at much faster clock speed. The results are latched into registers by a clock edge. Thinking in terms of that, the \"registers\" that you are complaining about would be one of those. Also there is no longer a simple things like you concept of memory anymore. There is caches, memory controller and external memory.

(NYSE: ICE), and one of the leading providers of mortgage data, today released the September 2025 ICE First Look at mortgage delinquency, foreclosure and prepayment trends. The data shows that overall mortgage performance remains historically strong, with both delinquencies and foreclosure activity remaining below long-term averages. While some shifts are emerging among government-backed loan segments, these trends largely represent a normalization of market dynamics rather than broad-based weakness. \u201cThe mortgage market remains remarkably resilient, with mortgage performance continuing to hold up well,\u201d said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. \u201cDelinquency rates improved in September, and even as we see increases in activity among FHA loans, we\u2019re largely returning to more typical levels following several years of artificially low foreclosure volumes.\u201d **Key takeaways from this month\u2019s findings include:** * Delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic norms: The national delinquency rate fell by 2 basis points (bps) in September to 3.42%, down 6 bps from the same time last year and 58 bps below its September 2019 pre-pandemic level. * Strength across delinquency bands in September: Both early-stage (30-day) and late-stage (90+ day) delinquencies improved month-over-month, as the vast majority of borrowers remain current on their mortgage payments. * Non-current rates improved for most investors: The non-current rate (delinquencies plus active foreclosures) declined year-over-year among GSE (-3 bps), VA (-4 bps) and portfolio-held loans (-17 bps). FHA loans were the notable exception, rising by 44 bps from last year\u2019s levels. * Foreclosure activity is returning to normal ranges: There were 103,000 foreclosure starts in Q3 2025, a 23% increase from the same period last year, but 18% below Q3 2019\u2019s pre-pandemic levels. * Improving efficiency in resolution: The number of loans in active foreclosure rose modestly year-over-year (18%), yet overall foreclosure volume remains historically low, with Q3 foreclosure sales (21,000) at roughly half of 2019 levels. FHA loans account for the majority of that rise, making up 38% of active foreclosures, roughly half of the annual rise in foreclosure starts and 80% of the rise in active foreclosures. The resumption of VA foreclosure activity following last year\u2019s moratorium is largely responsible for the remainder. * Prepayments are edging higher: Prepayments rose by 8 bps in September to a 0.74% single month mortality (SMM) rate, a 15% increase from the prior year, as interest rates began to ease in August.",

        "text_content": "Final tweet thread on the GPT-5 pro use to solve open problem by Prof. Ernest Ryu from UCLA. Some interesting excerpts (the whole thread is highly interesting, another preprint by all human authors on this will also be released soon) > NAG was introduced by Nesterov in 1983 as an accelerated improvement upon plain gradient descent, yet its point convergence remained unresolved until today. Nesterov ODE was studied as a simplified proxy, aimed at gaining insight into the behavior of its discrete counterpart. > Indeed, translating the continuous-time proof into the discrete-time setup turned out to be relatively straightforward. With one piece of feedback, ChatGPT was able to work out the proof. https://chatgpt.com/share/68fc3977-b8c8-8009-b673-48c5661fcb1b > Conclusion: > Starting from the key idea of the first tweet, we extended the convergence result to several related settings and resolved the main 42-year-old open problem, with ChatGPT doing most of the heavy lifting along the way. > Overall, this entire journey took just a week, less than 30 hours of my time. ChatGPT\u2019s assistance provided a significant speedup, and without it, I would most likely have given up after three days of slow progress. (As I did in the past.) > Again, ChatGPT is now at the level of solving some math research questions, but you do need an expert guiding it. > I strongly encourage fellow mathematicians to try incorporating AI assistance into their workflow.

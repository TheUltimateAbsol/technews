Intel Foveros uses basically separate 22nm dies beneath the tiles to carry the wires. AMD (TSMC) has the wires going through the interposer. And NVLink has a bunch of different shapes so we can't compare them directly. Latency, bandwidth, cost and complexity are different depending on the implementation. In general the farther you want to go, the interconnect gets more expensive, higher latency and less bandwidth. If you want to go from one PCB to another through a cable then it all goes to hell, latency explodes, cost explodes, bandwidth goes down the drain.",

It's fundamentally a bunch of wires, though there are a number of different ways to route them. If the wires are short enough, you can effectively treat the dies as one, with no special communication protocols required. The V-cache that AMD uses on some processors is like this, as is the connection between CPU and media die (I/O and GPU) with Strix Halo. When the wires get longer, you need to transmit the data from one end and receive at the other, which is usually just shortened as SERDES (serialize/deserialize, as it sends a stream of bits in serial). This adds power consumption, so you want to avoid it for low-power applications. Even when you could do direct link instead of SERDES, you might go with the latter to make the packaging simpler, cheaper, and more reliable.",

And If people are fleeing HCOL metros, why do prices keep going up?

This is Boston area growth. These other states - their \u201cdomestic migration population gain\u201d is from nearby states. People aren\u2019t \u201cfleeing\u201d NY for Alabama.

More than 10% of their people are already born from IVF, and the biggest roadblock in IVF is embryo creation. Their birth rate is low too. Boost the success, lower the health burden, and decrease the cost of embryos, and they will see an uptick in births. Not to replacement or anything crazy like that, but maybe a solid 0.1 improvement in TFR. This is one of the best national investments they can make. Of course, improving embryo creation also enables substantial embryo selection. Probably not their goal, but it'll happen regardless.",

Fusion leads to widespread usage of desalination (extremely energy hungry process), those 2 solve energy and water. If you solve energy and water the next follow up is food since you should be able to harvest salty water and make vertical gardens almost everywhere that has access to a sea/ocean. Basically you get AGI, you make it solve fusion for you, then you make it build the fusion plants asap with robots and that leads to everything else becoming so much cheaper, then UBI is viable for everyone. Of course the above point doesn't take into account human greed which is a different topic all together.",

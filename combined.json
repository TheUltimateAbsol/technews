It also put 100ms sleep calls in interrupt context (aka the CPU is **forced** to pause and can't do anything else for 100ms), and other broken logic that repeatedly trigger those sleep calls for even more latency spikes. It took someone decompiling the BIOS code to determine the root causes: https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1niwi6e/asus_gaming_laptops_have_been_broken_since_2021_a/ -------------------------------------------------------------- > As the embedded tweet below emphasises, Asus has only released fixes for the ROG Strix Scar 15 (G533ZW) and Zephyrus M16 (GU604VI) that the company launched in 2023. > Even then, Asus stresses that these BIOS updates are still in beta. Presumably, fixes for more laptop models will follow in due course. Unfortunately, Asus has not provided a timeline for any of these additional laptops. Anyone want to take bet if the affected 2021-2022 laptops are patched or abandoned by Asus?",

        "text_content": "With the release of the Soma Anniversary, Frictional Games included a secret link that led to a website called Hotel Samsara. This seems to be a teaser for their next project ip. The website itself however seems to be full of secrets as well. If you sign up to receive emails from them, you will receive strange messages, some of which use glitchy text, one that was upside down, and another speaking of people disappearing and the importance of checking back regularly for updates. In the most recent email however, and the reason I'm typing this all out, there seems to be some clues to a code of sorts which I am unable to crack on my own. I was wondering if anybody wanted to help? The message reads: \"Password Reminder [USERNAME] Thank you for requesting a reminder for your password. XXXXXX Your memorable hint: For the five, seek the paths. For the sixth, shrouD empty siren, contra totem; omni whispers.\" I did not request for a password reminder, nor was I ever prompted to enter a password when signing up. Looking closely at the message, I figured the x's could be a clue as to how many letters go into this password, and that maybe other people receiving these emails got a different clue. Mine says for the five and the sixth, so maybe one of you know what the clues for the first, second, third, etc. could be? Also, the D is capitalised in shrouD. Checking the website closely again there appear to be certain letters that are bold in contrast to the others. I wrote down all I could find here: SteganogRapH And then the D might be added to the end. I have no clue as to what this could mean, whether it be an anagram or what. Perhaps I am missing more clues. Is there anyone out there following along with this project to see where it leads? Frictional is one of my favorite developers, and it's real exciting to see them slowly unveiling a new cryptic project. Also to note, the link in the email to confirm my address had the name Kepler Interactive to it. Maybe this confirms they are working with Frictional on this new game? Let me know your thoughts!",

Over the past decade, AI applications have significantly advanced histopathology, facilitating tasks from tissue classification to predicting cancer prognosis, gene alterations, and therapy responses. These developments are supported by the availability of high-quality whole-slide images (WSIs) and publicly accessible databases like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which integrate histologic, genomic, and clinical data. Deep learning techniques replicate and enhance pathologists\u2019 decisions, addressing challenges such as inter-observer variability and diagnostic reproducibility. Moreover, AI enables robust predictions of patient prognosis, actionable gene statuses, and therapy responses, offering rapid, cost-effective alternatives to conventional methods. Innovations such as histomorphologic phenotype clusters and spatial transcriptomics have further refined cancer stratification and treatment personalization. In addition, multimodal approaches integrating histologic images with clinical and molecular data have achieved superior predictive accuracy and explainability. Nevertheless, challenges remain in verifying AI predictions, particularly for prognostic applications and ensuring accessibility in resource-limited settings. Addressing these challenges will require standardized datasets, ethical frameworks, and scalable infrastructure. While AI is revolutionizing histologic assessment for cancer diagnosis and treatment, optimizing digital infrastructure and long-term strategies is essential for its widespread adoption in clinical practice.\"",

In particular we take N=10 sequential, equally weighted bottleneck stages with geometric compute thresholds, a capability that grows deterministically with a 7-month doubling, adoption that is instantaneous (I think it will be fast generally but not very fast in europe), results are read at 7-month increments as a step function, accessory work is ignored, and no shocks, costs, constraints, feedbacks, or task heterogeneity.

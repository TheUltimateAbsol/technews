And a masterclass in mood. That undefinable Dreamcast mystique is still intact even today, all these years later. Claire wakes up in an underground jail cell at the outset of the game, speaks briefly to her wounded captor, and then wanders upward toward the surface, armed only with a knife and a lighter. Out of the cell, down the hall, up the stairs, and out into the rain, where she\u2019s suddenly standing in a cemetery on some weird island of horrors. tl;dr: This game is a shining star in the firmament of vibes-based gaming.

The deal could help the venerable chipmaker fund its US-based semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, which have required billions of dollars to construct and maintain, even as demand for Intel chips has waned in recent years. Some chip industry experts and members of the Trump administration say that keeping Intel afloat is essential to US national security, because it lessens the country\u2019s reliance on chipmakers overseas. But analysts and one notable economist say a potential tie-up between Intel and the US government could present a conflict of interest, and may not result in the kind of domestic chip-making industry the administration is angling for.

            {
                "raw_content": "15% of home purchases fell through last month\u2014the highest July rate on record\u2014as high homebuying costs made buyers skittish. Cancellations were most common in Texas and Florida. Roughly 58,000 U.S. home-purchase agreements were canceled in July, equal to 15.3% of homes that went under contract last month. That\u2019s up from 14.5% a year earlier and marks the highest July rate in records dating back to 2017. Roughly 1 in 7 U.S. Home Purchases Fall Through This is based on a Redfin analysis of MLS pending-sales data. The data are seasonal, which is why we compare this July to past Julys. Please note that homes that fell out of contract during a given month didn\u2019t necessarily go under contract the same month. For example, a home that fell out of contract in July could have gone under contract in June. Home purchases are falling through more than usual because high prices, high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty are making buyers uneasy. Buyers also have more homes to choose from than in the past, which means they hold the negotiating power in many markets and often aren\u2019t in a rush. They may back out during the inspection period if a better home comes up for sale or they discover an issue they don\u2019t want to fix. Cleveland Redfin Premier real estate agent Bonnie Phillips said the most common reasons buyers back out of deals are cold feet, high standards and issues with inspections, and she noted that cancellations are particularly common among buyers who use FHA and VA loans. But some would-be buyers have other reasons for backing out: \u201cI recently had an older first-time buyer get cold feet the week before the deal was supposed to close,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt was a beautiful house, we got it for the price she wanted and there were no issues in the inspection, but her neighbors convinced her that owning is too much of a hassle and she should rent instead.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that the housing-market tides are starting to shift slightly. Mortgage rates have been coming down, which could bring some sidelined buyers back to the market, and supply is also ticking down, which could increase buyer urgency. Home Purchases Are Most Likely to Fall Through in Texas and Florida In San Antonio, 730 home-purchase agreements were canceled in July, equal to 22.7% of homes that went under contract last month\u2014the highest percentage among the metros Redfin analyzed. Next came Fort Lauderdale, FL (21.3%), Jacksonville, FL (19.9%), Atlanta (19.7%) and Tampa, FL (19.5%). Redfin analyzed the 50 most populous metro areas, and included the 44 with sufficient data. Florida and Texas have been building more homes than anywhere else in the country, prompting some buyers to back out of deals because they\u2019re confident they will be able to find a different home that works better for them. Some buyers in the Sunshine State are also getting cold feet due to increasing natural disasters and soaring insurance and HOA fees. Home purchases were least likely to fall through in Nassau County, NY (5.1%), Montgomery County, PA (8.2%), Milwaukee (8.3%), New York (9.5%) and Seattle (10.2%). Virginia Beach, Newark See Biggest Upticks in Cancellations In Virginia Beach, VA, nearly 500 home-purchase agreements were canceled in July, equal to 16.1% of homes that went under contract last month. That\u2019s up 3.6 percentage points from 12.5% a year earlier\u2014the largest increase among the metros in this analysis. Rounding out the top five are Newark, NJ (+3.3 ppts), Baltimore (+3 ppts), San Antonio (2.8 ppts) and Houston (2.8 ppts). Virginia Beach has a higher share of homeowners with VA loans than any other major metro, according to a separate Redfin analysis, with Baltimore also near the top of the list. Cancellations fell from a year earlier in 11 metros, with the biggest drops in Phoenix (-2.4 ppts), Orlando, FL (-1.4 ppts), Tampa (-1.3 ppts), Sacramento, CA (-1.3 ppts) and Philadelphia (-1.2 ppts).",

                "raw_content": "As supply volumes drop across the U.S., some individual apartment markets are logging pronounced declines. In the U.S. overall, just over 354,000 units were under construction at the end of 2nd quarter and scheduled for completion in the coming year. That is a 33.9% decline from the roughly 535,800 units completed in the year-ending 2nd quarter 2025, according to data from RealPage Market Analytics. Next year\u2019s scheduled supply in the U.S. marks a return to a more normal supply environment. In the past decade, supply volumes averaged roughly 360,000 units annually, elevated notably by the record volumes from the past few years. Across the nation, most big and small apartment markets alike are set to see declining supply volumes in the coming 12 months. Among the nation\u2019s 50 largest apartment markets, seven are scheduled to see delivery volumes fall by roughly twice the national pace \u2013 about 60% or more \u2013 in the coming year. The sharpest decline in apartment supply in the coming year is set for San Jose. New apartment completions in San Jose hit a record pace of 5,122 units delivered in the year-ending 2nd quarter 2025. At the end of the quarter, there were 2,008 units under construction in San Jose, with 1,151 of those units scheduled to complete in the coming year. That\u2019s a 77.5% decline from last year\u2019s pace and hits well behind the market\u2019s decade average of 3,092 units delivered annually. The only other West region market on this list is Denver, which was one of the nation\u2019s biggest centers for apartment deliveries in the year-ending 2nd quarter 2025 with the completion of 17,462 units. Just over 6,600 units are slated to wrap up construction in the next 12 months in Denver, which represents a decline of 62.1%. Three Midwest region markets are scheduled to see drastic supply declines in the coming year. Minneapolis, Indianapolis and Milwaukee are all slated to see their supply volumes come down by roughly 60% to 70% by the end of 2nd quarter 2026. San Antonio is seeing the South region\u2019s deepest relative decline in apartment supply in the coming year. Roughly 3,600 units are under construction and scheduled to complete by the end of 2nd quarter 2026, which is 68.2% less than completed last year. Just missing the 60% decline mark were South region markets Austin, Memphis and Houston, where supply volumes are scheduled to come down by 56% to 59%. Austin is the market with the nation\u2019s deepest volume decline in the coming year, with deliveries dropping by 15,874 units. It\u2019s worth mentioning, fellow Texas market Dallas is also seeing supply come down by about 15,000 units in the coming year, representing a relative decline of 44.4%.",

I have a nuanced take. >There are 3 proofs in discussion: v1. ( \u03b7 \u2264 1/L, discovered by human ) v2. ( \u03b7 \u2264 1.75/L, discovered by human ) v.GTP5 ( \u03b7 \u2264 1.5/L, discovered by AI ) Sebastien argues that the v.GPT5 proof is impressive, even though it is weaker than the v2 proof. >The proof itself is arguably not very difficult for an expert in convex optimization, if the problem is given. Knowing that the key inequality to use is [Nesterov Theorem 2.1.5], I could prove v2 in a few hours by searching through the set of relevant combinations. >(And for reasons that I won\u2019t elaborate here, the search for the proof is precisely a 6-dimensional search problem. The author of the v2 proof, Moslem Zamani, also knows this. I know Zamani\u2019s work enough to know that he knows.) >(In research, the key challenge is often in finding problems that are both interesting and solvable. This paper is an example of an interesting problem definition that admits a simple solution.) >When proving bounds (inequalities) in math, there are 2 challenges: (i) Curating the correct set of base/ingredient inequalities. (This is the part that often requires more creativity.) (ii) Combining the set of base inequalities. (Calculations can be quite arduous.) >In this problem, that [Nesterov Theorem 2.1.5] should be the key inequality to be used for (i) is known to those working in this subfield. >So, the choice of base inequalities (i) is clear/known to me, ChatGPT, and Zamani. Having (i) figured out significantly simplifies this problem. The remaining step (ii) becomes mostly calculations. >The proof is something an experienced PhD student could work out in a few hours. That GPT-5 can do it with just ~30 sec of human input is impressive and potentially very useful to the right user. However, GPT5 is by no means exceeding the capabilities of human experts.\"",

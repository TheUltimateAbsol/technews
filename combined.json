Kepler has (based on previous rumours) inside information at AMD, and when checking for any info, I saw this posted. For context, this is from a thread estimating 37 million might have been sold and why it is less than 30 million. Kepler discusses PS5 and Xbox profitiability as well. >\"They aren't even at 30M\" Source: [https://www.neogaf.com/threads/xbox-series-x-s-estimated-to-have-sold-37-million-units.1686826/post-270676156](https://www.neogaf.com/threads/xbox-series-x-s-estimated-to-have-sold-37-million-units.1686826/post-270676156) >\"You don't need 3rd party trackers, you can use AMD's number and Sony's number to figure out Xbox sales.\" Source: [https://www.neogaf.com/threads/xbox-series-x-s-estimated-to-have-sold-37-million-units.1686826/post-270677158](https://www.neogaf.com/threads/xbox-series-x-s-estimated-to-have-sold-37-million-units.1686826/post-270677158) >\"Steam Deck is part of SCBU and counted as a console.\" Source: [https://www.neogaf.com/threads/xbox-series-x-s-estimated-to-have-sold-37-million-units.1686826/post-270677367](https://www.neogaf.com/threads/xbox-series-x-s-estimated-to-have-sold-37-million-units.1686826/post-270677367) >Van Gogh and all of its variants were developed by SCBU (Semi-Custom Business Unit) and fall under the same reporting as the consoles.

NYC\u2019s RE market is interesting but different from anywhere else in America. > I\u2019ve also reminded myself many times that the money we used for the down payment isn\u2019t \u201cgone.\u201d We\u2019ve just invested it in a different way. Unlike dropping money on a designer ensemble or new car, an apartment is an appreciating asset\u2014at least usually. The one-bedroom unit we are purchasing has gone up 20% in value in the five years since it was last on the market. this is actually probably going to ultimately be somewhat true. NYC apartments aren\u2019t that \u2018bubbly\u2019. unlike say, the condos in the city. apartments didn\u2019t crash that hard in 08 and they\u2019re not going to this time. the price-to-rent ratio is low already. but the problem i have with this article, is people (morons) will read this, not examine it thoughtfully, and take away the wrong ideas. it\u2019s not normal, a rite of passage, or a good idea to buy a condo in Denver, for example, with a PTR ratio of like, 25%. you are going to lose all your downpayment money and be underwater for a decade+. you are going to be financially (and physically) trapped. the stress is going to be immense. you\u2019ll have signed-on to throw away years of your life, and it was painfully clearly avoidable. (rent vs buy calculations \u2026 well, they *were* common knowledge for the one thing to evaluate before making a home purchase.) you only get a few decades of life, if you\u2019re lucky. overburdening 5-10yrs of one\u2019s short existence because of FOMO and not doing maybe an hour of research is really sad, but an idiot is born every minute.",

        "text_content": "I started thinking about something that might not be as far-fetched as it sounds: if AGI or even ASI arrives and automates most human tasks, and no UBI or some radical form of redistribution is implemented, then what real options will most people have left? The most likely one: simulating a fulfilling life, but virtually. If there\u2019s no work, no traditional sense of purpose, and no material guarantees, but there are hyperrealistic virtual environments, neural interfaces, and emotionally gratifying artificial companions, then living inside a pleasant simulation could seem like a logical, even desirable, solution. We might end up in immersive worlds where you can explore, achieve things, fall in love without physical limitations, and reward systems that fill the existential void left by the loss of social roles. But even if we live mentally elsewhere, our physical bodies still need food, water, energy, and basic healthcare. If there is no UBI, where does that come from? One possibility is that we might rely on technologies that produce functional, low-cost food: microalgae, lab-grown meat, fortified powders, or Soylent-like pastes. The goal wouldn't be culinary pleasure, but simply keeping bodies alive with the bare minimum while the mind inhabits another reality. Another possibility is almost fully disconnecting from the physical body. In that case, we might live in automated pods that feed us intravenously, regulate basic functions, and keep us alive while our consciousness remains fully immersed in a simulation. Something like The Matrix or Ready Player One, but maybe chosen, not imposed.",

I think the world should avoid dystopian futures haha. FDVR doesnt have to be dystopian but being forced into it because life is horrid is. Automation should bring the end of scarcity thats the whole idea, so hopefully this will mean better lives and more freedom for all. Also if our future does look anything like this under automation, ie: the businesses all chose to automate their factorys, then sack everyone and then shut down the automated product lines as no one bought anything (yes its quite absurd they would choose this route but if they did...) then I would wake you from your VR, as we would have plenty of work to do destroying the elites.",

As it exists now, though, it's basically just a different conversational template where it asks a bunch of questions in chat. There's no lecture component, no supporting visuals, no course structure, etc. Those things are within the capabilities of current AI though, the service just doesn't do it (yet).

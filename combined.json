Going beyond 240W (many laptops are in the 280W-300W range now) will be even harder. I can see why they did it though, especially given that many cheap cables can barely handle 5A to begin with. That's the issue of trying to create a one-size-fits-all charging standard. Charging phones which use no more than 15-30W and laptops which can easily pull 300W is not easy to handle under the same standard. Thus I view USB-C at 240W little more than a novelty. I personally liked Lenovo's custom 20V/7A USB-C solution and only wish they made it open. While the upgradable GPU is a great idea and I really support it, I think the primary issue of sustainability isn't being able to upgrade the CPU/GPU but rather the durability of overall system components. A big reason why powerful laptops are often discarded is because of failures to the fans (bearings are a big failure point as the fans are much faster yet cheaper than desktop fans) or cooling solution or power delivery, as they suck down power and generate huge amounts of heat. The next biggest reason is running out of memory (so upgradability there is key)",

This is entirely transparent to software; it is all handled in hardware. AMD has seen a \\~25% reduction in fabric bandwidth usage. That should explain why AMD chose to stick with GDDR6, or perhaps how the 9070XT manages to compete with the 5070 Ti, despite the latter having a massive 40% raw bandwidth advantage. Of course, the 9070XT also has 33% more SRAM (64MB vs. 48MB), so it\u2019s not exactly a 1:1 comparison, but still\u2026 quite impressive. In any case, I have a feeling things will really heat up on the Radeon side next generation thanks to GDDR7, N3, and the shift to a brand-new architecture (hopefully).

        "text_content": "So, as Nintendo announced, they had a pretty large demo booth at Fan Expo Canada in Toronto, reminiscent to the invited Switch 2 demo experiences they\u2019ve had before. These are the games they had to demo: - Mario Kart World - Donkey Kong Bananza - Kirby and the Lost Dreamland (Nintendo Switch 2 edition with new story DLC) - Hades II - Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition - Borderlands 4 - Metroid Prime 4 (with 120 fps and specially set up tables to try out mouse mode) Was quite surprised they set up such a big demo, though this is one of the largest cons in Canada - we still usually don\u2019t get big demo booths like this for non released games - seems they are really pushing the marketing for the Switch 2. Line was long but when we got in we had about 45 minutes in the booth. Also got a Switch 2 tote and a lanyard if we tried three games lol. What I got to try: - Donkey Kong Bananza: They were running the demo that exists already on the eshop already, but I had never tried it. I\u2019m sure everyone already knows it\u2019s fun, but I DID feel the performance quality issues that were officially described. It was more than I expected. Totally playable and fun though. - Kirby and the Lost Dreamland (Nintendo Switch 2 edition with new DLC story): The FPS and resolution improvement is extremely noticeable, and the new DLC is very pretty with the new icey sparkly areas! If you already liked this game, you\u2019ll love the new DLC. - Hades II: As someone who loved Hades I, I was most excited to demo this (I haven\u2019t gotten it on other platforms yet). It\u2019s insanely good. Very reminiscent of the first game, just better!! - Metroid Prime 4: I did not try this out myself as there was a separate line for it, but I did watch people playing it. You could DEFINITELY see that it was 120 FPS, and it was quite stable. I did not notice any frame drops when moving the camera around or shooting. Resolution looks good too. Seems promising. - Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition: Also did not try this out myself but watched people playing it while I was waiting in live. The graphics actually look pretty good for what it is - but it was definitely running at between 30-40 fps. With it not in my hand I can\u2019t talk about the feel of the controls, but if you\u2019re used to playing it at higher FPS - I can see people easily getting frustrated. This is definitely probably a \u201cyou really want it in handheld or don\u2019t own any other console\u201d type of port.",

Or the 28th, when it strikes midnight in Japan, so that other people around the world will be able to play it at the same time. But unless Nintendo said anything, we can't know except.. There has been 1 game that had this before: Jamboree. So my question is, if you do have Jamboree Switch 2 edition, when did it unlock for you, and if you do say so, perhaps which timezone you are from. I myself never got Jamboree S2 edition, so I am not of much help here. Or of course if someone has an official nintendo statement about the time, that would be very helpful too.",

Prices nationally rose at their slowest pace since July 2023. A less comprehensive measure of home prices released by the National Association of Realtors showed the median existing-home sale price was about flat in July at $422,400. \u201cFor the first time in years, home prices are failing to keep pace with broader inflation,\u201d Nicholas Godec, S&P Dow Jones Indices\u2019 head of fixed income tradables and commodities, said in a statement. American housing wealth has declined over the past year when adjusted for inflation, he said. \u201cUnless rates come down in a meaningful way, and demand starts to snap back, you\u2019re hard pressed to see home prices start to recover any time soon,\u201d says Rick Palacios, Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. Buying a home remains expensive. Both home prices and financing costs exceed the prepandemic norm. However, conditions have quietly been brightening for would-be buyers as more sellers list their homes.

New York, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles are exceptions to this trend. \u200d * Monthly growth rates have been above the seasonal trend for nearly every month in 2025. Cotality, a leading global property information, analytics, and data-enabled solutions provider, released its latest Single-Family Rent Index (SFRI) for June 2025, which analyzes single-family rent price changes nationally and across major metropolitan areas. Single-family rent prices in June 2025 increased 2.9% from June 2024, slightly less than the 3.1% average increase a year ago. Single-family rent growth appears to have stabilized slightly under the pre-pandemic average. \u201cAnnual single-family rent growth appears to have stabilized just shy of 3% in 2025, approaching the long-run average of 3.4% seen before the pandemic. The monthly growth rate in June was close to the historical average for that month and has been above the seasonal trend for nearly every month of 2025,\u201d said Molly Boesel, Cotality senior principal economist. \u201cWhile rent growth weakened in most large metropolitan areas in June, exceptions included New York, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, increased rent growth is likely due to the dissipating effects of the January wildfires. The rising rent growth in Northeast markets like New York and Philadelphia could be a spillover effect from the home sales market, where strengthening home prices may be pricing out potential buyers.\u201d Rent prices for high-end properties increased 3.7% year over year in June 2025, a pickup from the year-over-year gain of 3.2% in June 2024. Low-end rent prices increased 1.7% year over year in June 2025, a drop off from the 3% gain in June 2024. Rent for detached rentals grew by 2.6%, and attached rental rates rose by 2.4% in June 2025. Chicago saw the highest rent growth, moving to the top of the SFRI at 5.7% in June 2025. New York-New Jersey-White Plains, NY-NJ dropped to the second spot with rent growth at 5.5%. Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Detroit round out the top five locations with rent growth. Miami had the lowest rent growth recorded in June 2025 at -0.5%. Dallas moved out of the bottom spot, but only saw rent growth of 0.5%. The next Cotality Single-Family Rent Index will be released on September 18, featuring data for July 2025.

This trend even has its own name: the \u201cmissing middle.\u201d Today, we tap into newly added data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to offer additional insights into this segment of the housing market. Our FRED graph above shows the share of mortgage balances that are 60 or more days past due, broken down by property type: * single family (solid blue line) * condo/co-op (dotted light blue line) * 2 to 4 units (dashed orange line) * townhouse/planned (dashed-dotted purple line). Quarterly data are available since 2013. Between then and the time of this writing, overdue mortgage payments for multi-family housing with 2 to 4 units have consistently been more frequent than for any other type of residential property. What could explain this pattern? Research coauthored by Raphael Bostic from the Atlanta Fed notes that small and medium multifamily properties are the majority of rental units across the country and also house the largest percentage of the lowest-income households. Disruptions to the flow of rental income\u2014whether from vacancy, nonpayment, or broad economic downturns\u2014are likely to increase the risk of mortgage delinquency.",

Cortez Masto was instrumental in securing the initial VA approval to build the Elko cemetery. Before being approved in 2022, Elko had been under consideration for a veterans cemetery since 2011. The closest veterans cemeteries for regional veterans and their families are currently over 200 miles away \u2013 in either Fernley or Salt Lake City. Senator Cortez Masto\u2019s efforts helped speed up the process and secured a final commitment from the VA to begin construction on the Elko site. \u201cI am writing to request an update on the status of the Elko National Cemetery,\u201d Cortez Masto wrote. \u201cAs you know, veterans in the Elko region currently face long travel times to access burial and memorial services, with no national or state veterans\u2019 cemeteries in the region. The Elko cemetery project is a crucial step toward closing that gap, and I appreciate the VA\u2019s continued partnership in bringing it to completion.\u201d \u201cAfter hearing directly from Elko veterans, I introduced the Elko National Cemetery Act in March 2020 and again in 2021, with Senator Rosen\u2019s support, to authorize the necessary land transfer from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),\u201d she continued. \u201cIn September 2020, I helped secure an agreement from the VA to acquire 15 acres for the cemetery from the city of Elko, with the finalized sale completed in August 2021.\u201d \u201cThis cemetery represents more than just a construction project,\u201d the Senator concluded. \u201cIt is a lasting commitment to honor the lives and service of veterans in Elko and rural Nevada. I believe that transparency, coordination, and continued communication with the local community are essential as the project enters its next phase.\u201d In the letter, Cortez Masto asked the Trump Administration to provide updates on the timeline for completion of the project, any funding gaps or permitting issues, and current engagement with local veterans and stakeholders. She also reiterated that she looks forward to visiting the completed site.](https://www.cortezmasto.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cortez-masto-requests-update-from-administration-on-the-elko-national-cemetery-project/)",

        "text_content": "Just watched the Kiwi Talkz interview David O'Reilly, a former environmental artist at Rockstar who worked on GTA 5, RDR2 and GTA 6. At 12:35 he states that he had worked on GTA 6 for 5 years up until he left the company in 2023. Pretty sure he wasn't supposed to name the exact timeframe but let it slip mid conversation. That means the development started in 2018 after RDR2 released. I know a lot of people already assumed that this was the case but this is the closest we've come to an actual confirmation with a real source from Rockstar. So by the time the game actually releases the total dev time will be 8 years. This doesn't include the pre-production which supposedly started around 2015 according to multiple leaks. Pretty sure this make it the longest dev cycle for a Rockstar game Source: [https://youtu.be/DtKzFeNf\\_ug?t=752](https://youtu.be/DtKzFeNf_ug?t=752) 12:35 EDIT: Apparently David had already mentioned the dev time in his Trailer 2 reaction video on his personal YouTube channel back in May. \"I worked on GTA 6 from 2018 to 2023. Went onto it after we wrapped up on RDR2. It's fascinating having a look at all this stuff.\".

        "text_content": "For people who aren't up to speed, Nintendo's announced network maintenance on Thursday, one day before their annual shareholders meeting on Friday Anyway, last Wednesday Switch 2 exclusive \"Dear me, I was\" randomly got a release date of this Thursday (31/7/25) and was put on the eShop for pre-order, then on the following day (last Thursday) Switch 2 exclusive \"Handy Hockey\" was added to the eShop, also releasing this Thursday (31/7/25) Both of these budget games by smaller Japanese have had almost zero promotion and publicity so it's unusual that they're suddenly out in two days, especially as new titles on the Switch 2 eShop have been really thin on the ground untl now, especially ones not released by the big AAA developers. My theory is they were both told about the Direct last week (possible with other smaller/indie devs who have Switch 2 kits) and their games will be featured in it as some of the \"available on Nintendo eShop... today!\" titles, hence why they haven't promoted them and almost nobody knows they're coming. We haven't even seen any gameplay footage of \"Dear me, I was\" and very little is known about it outside of an artsy trailer with only story elements. This is very weird for a game coming out in two days! Furthermore I note that today Nintendo has added a new feature to eShop that lets you view ALL Switch 2 games, separately from Switch 1 games... you could already filter Switch 2 games in Search, but not see them all like this. You can find the banner for it in the Search section on Switch 2 eShop.... is Nintendo expecting more games and don't want them getting lost among Switch 1 titles? Lastly I have a feeling that the Tetris 99 DK Bananza was possibly announced today to get it out of the way in order to focus on the rumoured DK Bananza Mario Kart World DLC... Donkey Kong Bananza voice actors were found in Mario Kart World credits, but aren't featured in the game as yet. Could also be the case that Mario Paint was put out today to not have it overshadow bigger announcements for Mario's 40th anniversary, such a the rumoured Mario Galaxy 2 re-release... or N64/GameCube NSO announcements. Smash Bros 64 was recently spotted in the background of one of Nintendo's NSO trailers. eShop listings: Handy Hockey - [https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Handy-Hockey-2880674.html?srsltid=AfmBOorBzRg8M60N58N\\_6cGMJeB2zmyqYtD89IoLnh6jwQ3FaI\\_MGHUh](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Handy-Hockey-2880674.html?srsltid=AfmBOorBzRg8M60N58N_6cGMJeB2zmyqYtD89IoLnh6jwQ3FaI_MGHUh) Dear Me I Was - [https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Dear-me-I-was--2879690.html?srsltid=AfmBOoowdZBC-EXu9\\_RozChVDh0husckUgaSYIVqu-kI\\_vSb3ZuyLrU9](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Dear-me-I-was--2879690.html?srsltid=AfmBOoowdZBC-EXu9_RozChVDh0husckUgaSYIVqu-kI_vSb3ZuyLrU9)",

A national gauge of prices rose 2.3% from a year earlier, according to data from S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller. That was the smallest increase since July 2023 and comes after a 2.7% annual increase in April. \u201cMay\u2019s data continued the year\u2019s slow unwind of price momentum,\u201d said Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Potential buyers have stayed on the sidelines as a combination of elevated prices and high mortgage rates have fueled affordability challenges across the US. The housing market just posted its slowest spring selling season in more than a decade, and sales of previously owned homes fell to a nine-month low in June. Among 20 major cities, New York had the largest annual price gain at 7.4%, followed by Chicago and Detroit with jumps of 6.1% and 4.9%, respectively. Those three cities also had the biggest increases last month. Prices fell in four metro areas, compared with two last month. The largest drop was in Tampa at 2.4%, with Dallas, San Francisco and Denver posting slight dips. Despite prices dropping in some areas, high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty will continue to weigh on the housing market, according to Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. \u201cThe housing market is stuck, with both prospective buyers and sellers increasingly concerned about the economy and their own personal financial situations,\u201d she said",

Delinquencies on such debts from those making at least $150,000 annually have jumped almost 20% over the last two years, faster than for middle- and lower-income borrowers, according to the credit-scoring firm VantageScore. A recent Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis study found the share of people making late card payments in the highest-income zip codes has risen twice as much over the last year as in the lowest-income ones. The mounting liabilities coincide with a slowdown in hiring that has hit white-collar workers especially hard, raising the stakes for an economy that has come to rely more and more on consumer spending from top earners to power continued expansion. \u201cFinancial stress is evident from the lowest-income household to the highest-income household,\u201d said Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics. With the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates high and pandemic-era student loan forbearance programs now over, \u201cit\u2019s just become very difficult to juggle all of that,\u201d he said. Borrowing costs have become a central issue in American politics this year as President Donald Trump has blasted the Fed almost daily and repeatedly threatened to fire its chair, Jerome Powell, for refusing to cut them. The central bank is widely expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged again at its July 29-30 policy meeting. In a monthly New York Fed survey, the perceived probability of finding a new job has been sliding among respondents making $100,000 or more since 2023, and is now only a little better than a 50-50 proposition. The latest reading in June was still below any point between mid-2014 and the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Spending in the first quarter was the weakest since the onset of the pandemic, and more recent numbers for April and May indicated ongoing caution in discretionary categories like recreation services, air transportation and accommodations \u2014 all of which have registered outright declines this year. The good news is that, despite signs of rising stress, overall debt levels have come down in recent years relative to the size of the economy. The amount of household debt outstanding in the first quarter of 2025 was about 68% of gross domestic product, versus a record 98% in 2008. But that deleveraging only brings debt-to-GDP ratios back to levels that prevailed at the end of the 1990s, after consumer balance sheets had already been transformed by two decades of high interest rates and muted wage growth. In 1979, by comparison, household debt was just 48% of GDP. Meanwhile one category of household debt which has seen significantly less deleveraging since 2008 than others is student loans \u2014 and a recent resumption of payments on federal student loans with the wind-down of pandemic-era forbearance programs is adding to consumer stress. In the first three months of the year, the percentage of balances on such debts that were at least 90 days delinquent surged to 7.7%, according to the latest New York Fed data. More in the article",

This is the SoFi story I was reading about yesterday. Turns out if you just say \"HENRY\" when loaning money it's like saying \"AI\" when talking about a publicly traded company. It doesn't have to mean anything, you just get another few quarters to make it work! I don't know equities, so it's been a wild ride reading just how fucked I think companies like JP Morgan are with their asset sheets.

The mid to late 70s was a period of economic pain, stagflation and OPEC and all dat, in the US. I was alive for the decade up to 08. A lot of it has gone down the memory hole, but it also stunk, just for young folks, tho. The dot com bubble in 2000 followed by a huge slowdown for new employees and expansion after 9/11. So, lower end of the economy hurt, old people made out fine (same as it ever was). So, I guess my takeaway is \"personal debt to GDP isn't a good % to predict pain, but people not paying their debts sure seems to be?\"",

Rents typically get a boost in the spring because that\u2019s when people are most likely to move. But the increase this year was minimal at just 0.7 percent.* *\u201cThis increase is less than half of the typical increase during the second quarter over the past 20 years because vacancy remains elevated,\u201d said Cary Bruteig, a researcher with research firm Apartment Insights, a coauthor of the report.* *The vacancy rate in the metro Denver region was 6.4 percent, down from 7 percent in the first quarter. Studios have the highest vacancy rate, with 8.4 percent going unused.* *On a more granular level, Boulder, Broomfield and Jefferson County were tied for the lowest vacancy rate at 5.2 percent.

Those discounts don\u2019t show up in rent calculations.*** *Meanwhile, the pipeline of new apartment buildings is drying up. The number of properties under construction is down by roughly one-third from the peak in 2023, the report found.

                "raw_content": "US job openings fell in June after jumping in each of the prior two months, hovering at a level that indicates generally stable demand for workers. Available positions decreased to 7.44 million from a revised 7.71 million reading in May, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data published Tuesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 7.5 million openings. The pullback in openings was broad, driven by accommodation and food services, health care as well as finance and insurance. Tuesday\u2019s report supports characterizations of a cooling labor market, but only gradually. Job openings remain above average levels seen prior to the pandemic, suggesting there is still a relatively healthy demand for workers. However, hiring has slowed and it is taking unemployed people longer to secure a new position. The state of the labor market will be a major topic during the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting that concludes Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell has described the labor market as \u201csolid\u201d and cited uncertainty around the inflationary impact of tariffs as justification for holding interest rates steady. Officials widely are expected to do so again this time around, but there could be dissents from some policymakers who want to bolster the slowing labor market. That may become more evident in the July jobs report due Friday, which is forecast to show moderating job growth and higher unemployment. June\u2019s hiring rate slowed to 3.3%, the lowest since November, according to the JOLTS report. Layoffs were little changed at a subdued level, while few workers voluntarily quit their jobs. This suggests people are less confident in their ability to find a new position than they were last year. The number of vacancies per unemployed worker, a ratio Fed officials watch closely as a proxy of the balance between labor demand and supply, held at 1.1. At its peak in 2022, the ratio was 2 to 1. Some economists have questioned the validity of the JOLTS data, in part due to the survey\u2019s low response rate and heavy revisions. A similar index by job-posting site Indeed, which is reported on a daily basis, showed openings ticked down in June, extending a steady downward streak throughout this year.",

The 10-City Composite saw an annual increase of 3.4%, down from a 4.1% annual increase in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a year-over-year increase of 2.8%, down from a 3.4% increase in the previous month. New York again reported the highest annual gain among the 20 cities with a 7.4% increase in May, followed by Chicago and Detroit with annual increases of 6.1% and 4.9%, respectively. Tampa posted the lowest return, falling 2.4%. MONTH-OVER-MONTH The pre-seasonally adjusted U.S. National Index saw slight upward trends in May, posting gains of 0.4%. The 10-City Composite and 20-City Composite Indices both reported gains of 0.4%. After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a decrease of -0.3%. Both the 10-City Composite and the 20-City Composite Indices saw a -0.3% decrease, as well. ANALYSIS \u201cMay\u2019s data continued the year\u2019s slow unwind of price momentum, with annual gains narrowing for a fourth consecutive month,\u201d said Nicholas Godec, CFA, CAIA, CIPM, Head of Fixed Income Tradables & Commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cNational home prices were just 2.3% higher than a year ago, the smallest increase since July 2023, and nearly all of that gain occurred in the most recent six months. The spring market lifted prices modestly, but not enough to suggest sustained acceleration. \u201cThe National Composite Index rose 2.3% year-over-year in May, down from 2.7% in April. The 20-City Composite gained 2.8%, while the 10-City rose 3.4%, both down from the prior month. \u201cRegional results reflected the same narrowing pattern, but with stark geographic divergence. New York retained the top spot with a 7.4% annual gain, followed by Chicago (6.1%) and Detroit (4.9%), continuing the Midwest and Northeast leadership that has defined 2025. At the other end of the spectrum, Tampa declined 2.4% year over year, marking its seventh consecutive month of annual declines. Several Western markets posted minimal or negative gains: Los Angeles rose just 1.1%, San Diego 0.4%, Phoenix 0.9%, and San Francisco turned negative at -0.6%, reflecting persistent weakness in markets that experienced the sharpest pandemic-era run-ups. \u201cMonthly trends also signaled broad-based fatigue. All three headline indices rose just 0.4% on a nonseasonally adjusted basis, the slowest monthly gain since January. After seasonal adjustment, each declined 0.3%, marking the third consecutive month of seasonally adjusted declines for the National Composite. Only four cities \u2013 Cleveland, Minneapolis, Charlotte, and Tampa \u2013 showed month-overmonth acceleration, pointing to waning momentum breadth even as most cities still registered nominal gains. \u201cSeasonal momentum is proving weaker than usual, and the slowdown is now more than just a story of higher mortgage rates,\u201d Godec concluded. \u201cIt reflects a market recalibrating around tighter financial conditions, subdued transaction volumes, and increasingly local dynamics. With affordability still stretched and inventory constrained, national home prices are holding steady, but barely.\" https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20250729-1479094/1479094_cshomeprice-release-0729.pdf",

Fort Lauderdale, FL recorded the biggest drop (-17.4%). Sales of starter homes rose 3.9% year over year in June to the highest level in two years, a bright spot in an otherwise sluggish housing market where sales fell across other price tiers. This is according to a Redfin analysis where we divide U.S. homes into tiers based on the prices of homes sold over a rolling 12-month period. This report is focused on homes whose sale price fell into the 5th-35th percentile, which we define as starter homes. Our price-tier data is calculated in rolling three-month periods, with this report focusing on April-June. Data is subject to revision. June was the 10th consecutive month in which home sales rose year over year, indicating that first-time homebuyers are jumping into the market. In comparison, sales of mid-priced homes (35th-65th percentile of the market by sale price) fell 0.9% year over year in July, while high-price homes (65th-95th percentile) fell even more, down 3.6%. Pending sales of starter homes are also rising, up 3.1% year over year in June, a sign that closed sales are likely to continue increasing in the coming months. In comparison, pending sales of mid- and high-price homes fell 0.7% and 2.7% year over year in June, respectively. \u201cIn a market where it\u2019s difficult for most Americans to afford a dream home, many are turning toward starter homes,\u201d said Redfin Senior Economist Sheharyar Bokhari. \u201cThey\u2019re typically smaller and more modest, but starter homes remain within reach for some buyers who have been priced out of higher tiers. First-time buyers are especially apt to go for starter homes, as they don\u2019t have equity from a previous home sale to help with their payments. Even starter homes are too expensive for a large number of Americans, who are often forced to rent or live with family\u2014especially in metros like San Francisco where the median price of a starter home is nearly $1 million. U.S. homebuyers need to earn $112,131 per year to afford the median priced home for sale, while the typical U.S. household earns an estimated $86,258. \u201cWith prices rising and mortgage rates elevated, some first-time buyers may be pushed out of the market by move-up buyers who aren\u2019t able to afford the next tier themselves\u201d said Bokhari. **Starter home prices hit record as inventory rises to pre-pandemic levels** **The typical U.S. starter home sold for a record $260,000 in June, up 3.1% year over year.** In comparison, prices of mid-price homes rose 2.1% to $370,784 from a year earlier, while high-price homes rose 2.7% to $577,177. Both were just shy of price records set in previous months. While prices of starter homes remain at a record high, price growth has been slowing for six consecutive months. June\u2019s 3.1% pace was the slowest in a year. A big reason for slowing price growth in the starter-home segment\u2014and another reason why sales are rising\u2014is soaring inventory, with the number of active listings rising 19% year over year to the highest level for June since 2017. That was the fastest growth among the price tiers. Listings of middle-priced listings rose 15.1% year over year, while upper-priced homes grew 13.2% More starter homes for sale is good news for first-time homebuyers, according to Redfin agents. \u201cFirst-time buyers definitely have more opportunities now. Not only are there more lower-priced homes available, but there\u2019s less demand. The buyers who are out there are no longer in competition with 10 other offers, or all-cash buyers,\u201d said Kathy Scott, a Redfin Premier agent in Phoenix, where active listings of starter homes are up more than 40% from a year ago. \u201cWith so many starter homes on the market, buyers have an opportunity to take their time looking for houses that fit their needs. Some are waiting for prices to go down\u2014and they might\u2014but if your plan is to stay in the home for five to 10 years, you will build equity in your home.\u201d **Metro-Level Starter Home Highlights: June 2025** Redfin\u2019s metro-level starter home data includes the 50 most populous U.S. metros. Some metros are removed from time to time, to ensure data accuracy. All changes noted below are year-over-year changes. * Prices: The median sale price of starter homes rose most in Milwaukee (15.3% to $212,918), Detroit (13.6% to $93,140) and Newark, NJ (11.6% to $394,487). The largest falls were in San Antonio (-5.5% to $218,631), Austin, TX (-3.8% to $326,440), and Dallas (-1.2% to $297,079). * Sales: Starter home sales increased most in San Diego (18%), Providence, RI (17.4%) and Sacramento (14.3%). They decreased most in Fort Lauderdale, FL (-17.5%), Miami (-17.4%) and San Antonio (-9.6%). * Active listings: The total number of starter homes for sale increased most in Las Vegas (53.6%), San Diego (44.1%) and Phoenix (43.1%). Only one metro\u2014San Antonio\u2014saw a fall in active listings (-2.2%). * New listings: New listings of starter homes increased most in St. Louis (23.6%), Las Vegas (19.5%) and Newark (16.4%). New listings fell most in San Antonio (-13.8%), San Jose, CA (-13.4%) and Tampa, FL (-10.9%). * Speed of sales: Starter homes sold fastest in Seattle with a median of nine days, followed by Montgomery County, PA (15 days) and Indianapolis (17 days). They sold slowest in Fort Lauderdale, FL (99 days), West Palm Beach, FL (91 days) and Miami (83 days).",

Based on a recent internal poll, only 45% of our engineers are using AI on a regular basis and much smaller number was doing anything remotely autonomous. Most of that usage is AI powered code completion in IDEs using something like Q. I've talked to some friends at other FAANG or near FAANG sized companies and they have similar metrics. About 50% of people are using AI at some level and only about 10-20% are doing some amount of autonomous work. I have friends in fintech and medical device companies who aren't allowed to use AI at all for coding yet. The idea that 90% of code is written by AI or even that 90% coding projects use AI in any consequential way is fundamentally disconnected from reality. Outside of a few startups and early adopters who are leaning into vibe coding, I think most code is still written by people. I'm not trying to shit on AI, because it is amazing technology that makes my life easier, but let's be realistic and accept that there are about 4.5 million people in the US and there's no way that 90% of them fundamentally changed how they work in the last couple of years.",

In the 1990s, the North Atlantic cod fishery collapsed. Everyone knew the fish stocks were dwindling, but each fishing company kept pushing harder, hoping to outcompete the rest and survive. Instead, the whole ecosystem and the industry with it died. AI-driven layoffs feel eerily similar. Every company is racing to slash labor costs before competitors do. But in the process, we might be destroying the very thing that keeps the economy alive, purchasing power of consumers. Mass layoffs don\u2019t just hurt workers. They shrink demand. If millions lose income, spending drops. The economy stalls. No matter how efficient a company is, it still needs people who can afford its products. We\u2019re cutting costs in ways that could lead to mass unemployment, lower consumer spending, and eventually, corporate collapse. It\u2019s short-term quarterly based thinking hyped up as innovation. Some of the ultra-wealthy might think they\u2019ll ride out the storm at the top of a techno-feudal hierarchy. They own the platforms, hoard capital, and influence policy. But history says otherwise. When inequality becomes extreme, revolts tend to follow. No one is safe in a collapsing system. The people who profited the most often have the most to lose when things break. And let\u2019s say the working class really does become obsolete. AI and robotics can do it all. If we create superintelligent AI, why assume it\u2019ll stay loyal to the people in charge? If it sees them as inefficient or parasitic, it might phase them out.

You don't have to rely on a single scrap of good will for us to throw ourselves into a situation where the government is forced to support the common people in some fashion, and I'd wager, in a pretty damn nice fashion at that. [I'll give a recap here but here's my longer form argument. It's written much better over here than I will below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1lqu2e5/comment/n15mr7h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I address things like robots here in greater detail. -------- AI corporations will continue to work on AI, and in order to justify their funding, they will release models the very second they are considered safe to be turned loose. For the sake of this argument, let's assume they do it - they succeed, and AGI is revealed. It does everything you could hope for and more, but it isn't quite a magical ASI. If you are a business owner, especially in a field that is predominantly work that can be done behind a computer/\"remote,\" you are going to soon start feeling the pressure to adopt this AGI-agent in order to remain competitive. If you're in a noncompetitive market, the siren song of MORE PROFIT WIDER MARGINS MORE PROFIT will get louder with every month that passes as more and more businesses report success with the new agent. This, however, puts us in a dilemma. Any job that 'can' be automated will be automated, due to aforementioned competitive pressures. ...but (as I talk more about in my linked comment chain above), the ability to massively automate physical labor is still years away at best. Decades at worst. But you're laying off all your white collar workers RIGHT NOW. White collar workers make up the majority of consumer spending; the top 2/5ths of households make up 2/3rds of consumer spending, and those households are predominantly white collar. So, what does this leave us? Consumer spending is tanking, productivity should be either level (1:1 person to agent) or increasing (AI that is more efficient on a per-person basis). This explodes the economy. There's no \"waiting it out.\" If you are an oligarch and want to finish automating the economy, you NEED the economy to keep running long enough to replace everybody, but there will be years to decades of time where you can only replace some people while the other people MUST continue to work. No economy, means zero work, means everybody loses. Okay. That won't happen, obviously. The government will step in, right? I think that's a fair assessment - just like during Covid (though that would be peanuts compared to this), it will suddenly be in the best interest of 'everybody' to redistribute wealth enough to prop up consumer spending. You can be maximally greedy and still arrive at this conclusion. **You cannot exploit an economy that does not exist.** ...which, here's the kicker. Once a system like this is in place, the dynamic changes. Suppose you're a politician - a greedy, soul sucking politician - the single easiest way to garner more votes from your base is to promise more UBI/social support. Unlike today, where you must skim off of the productivity of other humans...in this new world, you're skimming off the top of AI. AI that does not vote, needs only a fraction as many resources as people (on a unit basis, bear with me here), and won't firebomb your datacenters if it goes hungry. Greedy AI companies opened the door. Greedy businesses painted themselves/the economy into a corner. Greedy politicians keep us well fed and furnished for their own gain after we've gotten out of the bind. Furthermore, as the economy grows faster and faster as AI continues to improve, the percentage of the whole that is required to support humans grows at the speed of humans, not the speed of GPU forges. Pretty soon, the struggle necessary to reclaim the rapidly dwindling sliver of productivity required to let every human live in luxury is just not worth the squeeze. Why bother? It becomes more profitable every year to put what you 'would' have used to reclaim that sliver into just...making more productivity. A positive outcome overall, I'd say. It will **absolutely not be perfect**, but it's a long way from being left out to starve. I'm okay with living in a world like this, I think. There's obviously a lot of fine details that could make it better or worse for people, but on the whole, \"we need to redistribute enough wealth to make up for the automation of the top 2/5ths of household income and their consumer spending, also we have exploding productivity that we can skim off the top of, good luck!\" seems fine to me? Happy to debate/discuss. I had to truncate a lot of points to fit into a single comment, so, I know there's holes.

You see, that girl from earlier genuinely used it to learn, not to cheat, and got great results. BUT she did not have a paid version of ChatGPT. In fact, she didn't even have an account. For math, the difference between base models and thinking models is insane. I describe it as a FAR bigger jump in capabilities than GPT3 to GPT4 was. My concern for her was even if she had good intentions, she was using the wrong model for the job. Getting 4o and 4o-mini to teach her how to do math questions? Oh no... It would've been so easy for the models to give her wrong information. I've since pointed her to Gemini 2.5 Pro since she can use that for free. I've prompted Gemini 2.5 Pro for some students to get something similar to this study mode (because students don't know how or why this is important). The issue with using AI to learn is when it gets something wrong - and you don't realize because you're not an expert. This improves with smarter models of course. Which means for free users, I wouldn't rely on ChatGPT at all for this - until GPT 5 releases at least.",

However, I don't think this breakthrough will initially come through advanced humanoid robots, as they're still too expensive and not yet practical enough for most households. Instead, our first widespread AI interactions are likely to be with affordable and approachable social robots like this one. **Disclaimer:** I'm an engineer at Pollen Robotics (recently acquired by Hugging Face), working on this open-source robot called **Reachy Mini**. ## Discussion I have mixed feelings about AGI and technological progress in general. While it's exciting to witness and contribute to these advancements, history shows that we (humans) typically struggle to predict their long-term impacts on society. For instance, it's now surprisingly straightforward to grant large language models like ChatGPT physical presence through controllable cameras, microphones, and speakers. There's a strong chance this type of interaction becomes common, as it feels more natural, allows robots to understand their environment, and helps us spend less time tethered to screens. Since technological progress seems inevitable, I strongly believe that open-source approaches offer our best chance of responsibly managing this future, as they distribute control among the community rather than concentrating power. I'm curious about your thoughts on this. ## Technical Explanation This early demo uses a simple pipeline: 1. We recorded about 80 different emotions (each combining motion and sound). 2. GPT-4 listens to my voice in real-time, interprets the speech, and selects the best-fitting emotion for the robot to express. There's still plenty of room for improvement, but major technological barriers seem to be behind us.",

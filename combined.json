After months of planning, weeks of building, and hours of hard work- I\u2019m happy to share this ASUS ProArt build. This is truly my best work to date and it genuinely changed how you view computer build configuration you see today. There\u2019s something special about building something with your hands \u2014 especially when it\u2019s not just a PC, but a piece of art. I designed and built this chassis out of solid black walnut, every panel cut, sanded, and oiled by hand. The goal wasn\u2019t just to make a computer \u2014 it was to create a functional sculpture that reflects how I work: intentional, refined, and built to last. And at the center of it all \u2014 the ASUS X870E-CREATOR ProArt motherboard. That board instantly felt like the perfect heart for a handmade machine. It\u2019s not just powerful \u2014 it\u2019s precise, elegant, and thoughtfully engineered in a way that mirrors craftsmanship itself. When the walnut meets the matte black of the ProArt board, there\u2019s this perfect contrast \u2014 natural grain meeting engineered precision with added silver bronze to truly mimic the finish of the ProArt line. It feels alive. It\u2019s feels organic. It feels mine. The X870E isn\u2019t just a motherboard. It\u2019s the creative core that brings this handmade chassis to life \u2014 a bridge between craftsmanship and technology. My experience and what I changed/optimized and why it helped on my level. First, I enabled the EXPO 1 for memory @ 6400 M/Ts for my sweet spot in gaming. Second, set the AI- over locking to my profile then went in to fine tune with manually tweaks. The performance and temps are excellent playing games such as Battlefield 6 and Borderlands 4. Having the GPU-Q Release was a breeze with the amount of times I had to connect and disconnect the GPU when building. Yes, this build was sponsored by ASUS and I love that I get to work with them on such an amazing build using their products. I get that it\u2019s an expensive board but you\u2019re paying for \u201cPro\u201d features such as 40gb, USB4, multi Gen 5 M.2\u2019s and PCIe slots, and WiFi 7, it pays back quickly in time saved and that to me is most important. Thanks for viewing, commenting and taking time out of your day to share my work.",

Many paragraphs of text feel a bit chatgpt-y, though. Damn that\u2019s a lot of praise for a motherboard lol.",

Or hated it, we all have opinions lol. There's a lot of animations that I wanted in the pilot, trailer, and intro, but with the current nature of AI, there's a lot of things that CAN be done, and there are a lot of things that CANT be done. Midjourney, Vidu, Veo3, etc. is still in its early days so there were a lot of limitations, but part of that breeds creativity. The main takeaway from this intro is that it is a proof of concept to show that we're reaching a time where single content creation is almost possible, whether its good or bad. This also shows why actual animators and creative visions are still important. I'm open to all kinds of feedback and questions about the project because it's still in its infancy as well. I can do my best to clarify anything if you're curious. Thanks again!",

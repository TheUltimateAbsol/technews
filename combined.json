When it comes to image quality, PSSR 2 and FSR 4 seems to trade blows against each other and i found that very interesting as i thought before PSSR 2 is going to be a lesser version of FSR 4 FP8 on PC RDNA 4 due to it being ran on INT 8 version of it, which is equivalent to the leaked unofficial version of FSR 4 that runs on RDNA 2 - 3. But here with PSSR2 that doesn't seem to be the case, both are nearly as good or sometimes even better depending on certain scenarios. As for direct comparison with DLSS 4.5 Preset L though yeah obviously Nvidia DLSS is still ahead and looks noticeably sharper, has more details and is more stable making it the still best Upscaler on the market right now. That said though, PSSR2 is still impressive usable upscaler. I just wish that the base PS5 got access to it which is stuck with FSR 1 rather than it being limited to PS5 Pro only. This makes the PS5 Pro version genuinely look a lot better than the base PS5 version. But the hardware limitation that Base PS5 which doesn't even have INT8 AI accelerator pretty much locks them out from having access to PSSR 2 / FSR 4.",

Will talk about it more tonight Many understandably interpreted this as Max having insider info about the situation due to how he phrased it, however he went on stream tonight and only referenced the previous public interviews with/ related to Miyazaki that have been going around today on social media (The Shuhei interview, and the two Miyazaki interviews about Demon's Souls Remake), as well as one personal interaction he had with people working on Soul Caliber unrelated to anything about Miyazaki's personal opinions on Demon's Souls Remake, so he doesn't seem to have any actual insider info related to Miyazaki's opinions. Max before pulling up the old interviews: >Before we get into it, and I pulled up a couple of old articles that go back like 4-5 years -theres one that I need to try to find- um..**Nobody has direct communication with Miyazaki**, whos like an executive lead at FromSoft, right? And who has been there for a very long time. **Nobody has direct communication with this dude, with his thoughts, his wants, his desires and his needs. We just dont. Unless, he gets into interviews and starts talking about shit. AND HE HAS! He legit has!** And then he proceeds to go into the old interviews that we've all seen today In terms of the Soul Caliber part (it seems this is what was being referenced earlier when people were saying that he was saying he has insider knowledge), It's kind of hard to hear who he describes he was talking to (it sounds like people working on a Soul Caliber game who were looking for input) but basically he talks about how he was expressing his hype about the possiblity of Bloodborne crossing over with Soul Caliber at one point in time and was told thats never going to happen because they \"wouldn't dare ask them(Fromsoft) for that\". So basically Max is citing this interaction as knowledge that informs his speculation on how the industry interacts with FromSoft/Miyazaki in general, but he doesn't appear to have any firsthand knowldege related to the Demon's Souls Remake situation. He was just thinking back to that situation to add to how he is speculating about how the industry handles things with FromSoft Max talking about Miyazaki in reference to old interviews: >\"He has acknowledged he has wanted Bloodborne to show up on modern hardware in some way, so the weird thing is like why is everything off the books now? Why is everything now suddenly different? **I don't know!** I don't know if his feelings have suddenly changed, other than him just being busy. \" \\- >\"So, what changed I wonder? **This is all speculative my dude, this is all completely speculative**\" And then he goes on to speculate why he believes the situation changed. So to sum it up, he appears to be just as in the dark as everyone else and is just speculating, rather than having any sort of actual insider knowledge on Miyazaki or even hearing anything from insiders about Miyazaki's thoughts on Bloodborne/Demon's Souls Remake. It's just his personal opinion he formed from reading the past interviews You can watch where he starts talking about it here about 3 mins in (Can't time stamp because of it being a livestream): [https://www.youtube.com/live/9kkYbkJd7hA?si=hbo94J0n8z0OtRNx](https://www.youtube.com/live/9kkYbkJd7hA?si=hbo94J0n8z0OtRNx)",

        "comments": [
            {
                "raw_content": "* 21% of U.S. mortgaged homeowners have a rate of 6% or higher, the highest share in a decade. 20% have a rate under 3%, the lowest share in 5 years. * The shift in mortgage-rate distribution reflects the fact that rates have been above 6% for nearly 4 years. * Redfin economists say this could be an opportune time to refinance: Rates are now below 6% for the first time in three and a half years. * For home sellers, the lock-in effect is fading. But some homeowners still feel locked in: 16% of homeowners are staying put rather than moving because they don\u2019t want to give up their low rate, per a Redfin survey. For the first time in five years, more U.S. homeowners have a mortgage rate above 6% than a rate below 3%. More than one in five (21.2%) mortgaged U.S. homeowners had a 6%-plus rate in the third quarter, up from 17.1% a year earlier and the highest share since 2015. A slightly lower share (20%) of mortgaged homeowners have a rate under 3%, the smallest share since the end of 2021. That\u2019s the second quarter in a row 6%-plus rates overtook sub-3% rates: In Q2 2025, 20.3% of homeowners had a 6%-plus rate, versus 20.2% who had rates under 3%. This marks a reversal from the pandemic and its immediate aftermath; the last time more homeowners had high rates than ultra-low rates was the third quarter of 2020, when rates were plummeting during the pandemic. This is according to a Redfin analysis of data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency\u2019s National Mortgage Database through the third quarter of 2025, the most recent period for which data is available. To look at the data another way, 78.8% of homeowners have a rate under 6%, the lowest share since 2015. The Shift Reflects How Long Rates Have Been Elevated The share of homeowners with a 6%-plus rate is rising because until this week, when they dropped to 5.98%, mortgage rates had been sitting above 6% since September 2022. The longer rates stay high, the more people have high rates. On the other end of the spectrum, the share of homeowners with 3% or lower rates surged at the start of the pandemic, when mortgage rates plummeted to record lows. That prompted many homebuyers to move, taking on a new, low mortgage rate, and prompted many homeowners to refinance into a low rate. But now that four years have passed since sub-3% mortgage rates were available, they\u2019re less common. People who are buying homes are taking on higher rates. For Homeowners With a 6%-Plus Rate, Refinancing May Save Money The weekly average mortgage rate is 5.98%, down from 6.76% a year ago and down from a two-decade high of 7.79% in October 2023. Refinancing isn\u2019t as popular as it was in 2020 and 2021, when homeowners could get a record-low rate. But for some homeowners\u2013the 21% of them who currently have rates above 6%\u2013refinancing at today\u2019s rates may make financial sense. \u201cFor homeowners with a rate north of 6%, this is a moment to run the numbers,\u201d said Chen Zhao, Redfin\u2019s head of economics research. \u201cWith average rates hovering at or just below 6%, some borrowers may be able to lower their monthly payment or their long-term interest costs by refinancing. It\u2019s not the once-in-a-generation opportunity we saw in 2020, but it could provide meaningful savings.\u201d A lot of homeowners are getting the memo: Refinance applications are up 150% year over year. Redfin economists expect more and more Americans to refinance as the year goes on, especially if rates stay around 6% or drop lower. The best time to refinance a home loan depends both on personal circumstances and mortgage market conditions; here\u2019s advice from Rocket Mortgage on determining the best time to refinance. The Lock-In Effect Is Fading The spread in mortgage rates shifting toward the higher end of the spectrum is also meaningful for homeowners thinking of selling. For the last several years, many Americans have felt locked in by their low mortgage rates, unwilling or unable to give up their 3% rate to move and take on a higher one. But now that rates have been above 6% for much longer than they were under 3%, many people have grown accustomed to high rates and decided to move on, which is reflected in the rise in new listings over the last year. And with rates at their lowest level in nearly four years\u2013albeit still double pandemic-era lows\u2013the math has improved enough for some homeowners to make a move. Redfin agents in some parts of the country say some homeowners have given up on waiting for mortgage rates to come down significantly; many people who have been considering moving decided to go for it with rates closer to 6% than 7%. But some homeowners are still feeling locked in. Roughly one in six (16%) U.S. homeowners say they\u2019re staying put in their current home rather than moving because they don\u2019t want to give up their low mortgage rate. That\u2019s from a November 2025 Redfin survey fielded by Ipsos; the question asked respondents who said they don\u2019t plan on selling their homes soon why they intend to stay put. Of the 12 options, \u201cI don\u2019t want to give up my low mortgage rate\u201d was the fifth-most commonly cited, after \u201cI just like my home and have no reason to move\u201d, \u201cMy home is almost or completely paid off\u201d, \u201cHome prices are now too high,\u201d and \u201cMy children or other family members are still living in my home.\u201d Here\u2019s the full breakdown of where today\u2019s homeowners fall on the mortgage-rate spectrum: * 6% or above: 21.1% of mortgaged U.S. homeowners have a rate below 6%, down from a record low of 7.3 in the second quarter of 2022 * 5%-5.99%: 10.2%, the highest share since the third quarter of 2020 (except Q2 2025, when it was 10.3%) * 4%-4.99%: 17.1%, the lowest share on record (before the pandemic, this was the most common mortgage-rate bucket) * 3%-3.99%: 31.5%, the lowest share since Q2 2016 * Below 3%: 20%, the lowest share since Q1 2021",

The average rate has been hovering close to 6% this year. This latest dip, its third decline in a row, brings it to its lowest level since Sept. 8, 2022, when it was 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.

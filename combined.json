A couple of days ago, I tried to post about concerns regarding a backdoor vulnerability in a decentralized hardware VPN router project developed by a Chinese team. I checked the \"rumor\" category and included supporting evidence, news reports, and discussions from others. You deleted it without giving me any reason. When I asked you about it, you told me the \"content was inappropriate\" (which was quite arbitrary and vague). Only after I pressed you further did you tell me that VPNs are software, not hardware. I then clearly explained to you that it was a hardware project and provided a link, but received no response, and you directly banned me for three days. I want to say that I have no ill intent, but your reasoning is incorrect. I wasn't focusing on politics, but rather on the potential backdoors in this hardware product itself. In short, perhaps I need an explanation, any explanation, such as why you don't allow content from China to be included, or why you don't allow hardware-based VPN products, etc. I look forward to your reply.",

Just classic, core game-design, like it stepped out from 2005. Right down to the collection of diffuse magical keys. Especially the Ice Belt reminds me of Snowpeak Ruins in Twilight Princess. Or Flare Pool, the Fire Temple in Ocarina of Time. The HDR-effects are absolutely beautiful and the soundtrack could become iconic. Samus silent confidence as she explores combined with the bangers is such a haunting mix. The thunderous rain in Volt Forge is a slam-dunk in atmosphere. Even the desert being empty doesn't really bother me, it's obviously not meant to be an open-world, more like a classic overworld similar to the ocean in Wind Waker or even the map in Mario. One thing I do agree with the critics regarding is Miles, who's quippy handholding is a bad fit for Metroid. People have likened him to the Marvel-movies, but I don't think that's quite it. I think he's rather a leftover from the Wii-era when Nintendo tried to branch out to casuals and needed to be sure **everyone** was having fun. But other than that, seriously Nintendo & Retro - thanks for this. Games like this makes me believe gaming didn't actually peak in 2007 and that there are still content out there for us who prefer artefacts, mini-bosses and powers-ups over microtransactions and battle passes.

I have none of the issues people complain about with S2 on my 4 year old Bravia. Did you have issues on other Nintendo games for 2? The biggest different for me is MKW and Bananza don't have much going on HDR-wise. It's just not used much and I think people think it's their TV when it's the game.

This lets it **climb the structure it is currently building** to reach higher levels. * **Scale:** They are also demonstrating tasks like welding panels, changing rover tires and excavating regolith. This is the **missing link** for colonization. Before humans arrive on Mars or the Moon, fleets of autonomous units like these will need to land first to build the habitat, solar array and comms tower. **The Goal:** GITAI aims to reduce space labor costs by **100x** and remove the risk of EVA (spacewalks) for simple assembly tasks.

In this universe when it comes to a level of general intelligence that's useful to us we have a single data point, n = 1, us. Other animals would be called weak general intelligence at absolute best. So idk why more isn't done to replicate how our general intelligence came about, artificially, to get AGI. Isn't relying on troves of data putting the cart before the horse and/or a crutch? lots of knowledge definitely can be a substitute for intelligence, especially with an ability to chain/blend knowledge together. but it's not AGI as we know. If humans could evolve general intelligence sufficient to drive a car long before inventing writing, then why does training AGI require reading more than a billion times what the most well read person? imo, it doesn't. imo with enough compute we can probably get there with a sufficiently crafted simulation. as for the details of such a simulation, I'm definitely not qualified, all I am sure about is obviously computing individual atoms, molecules, even cells (except maybe neurons) is a waste of compute. it doesn't need physics identical to ours because just like we can adapt to a VR game with wacky physics super easily, they would be able to adapt to our physics super easily provided it was remotely similar. but it probably can't be done in an environment too simplified, idk if an \"AGI\" evolved from a minecraft world could ever generalise to our world sufficiently, it'd be like humans trying to work in 4D I think, probably impossible. use visual, auditory, smell, taste, and tactile input: not converting things to text and feeding them into an LLM. obviously an evolutionary \"algorithm\" worked for us, but we could probably make it more efficient. obviously most species didn't evolve to our level of intelligence, in fact like >99.999% didn't. so the simulation should definitely be guided by a supervisor/manager. creating an environment where intelligence is more rewarded than on earth, and other evolutionary approaches like rabbits breeding and hiding are not rewarded past an early point (where hiding might be the most intelligent behaviour seen so far). honestly it'd probably be slow enough that a person could be watching for milestones and pressing the next stage button. since we're basically starting from 700 million years ago, if the simulation was ran fast enough to complete the goal of AGI in 1 year from start, that'd mean that each 6 minutes in real time would be equivalent to 7990 years of our evolution -> 700000000years/(24h*365)/10 = 7990 which isn't that long, obviously if you believed in this working you could leave a couple humans on shift 24/7 for a full year with no gaps. the compute is the hard part. simulating skyrim in real time with it's grossly simplified physics is fine, but simulating a complex world with ideally as many AGI candidates as you can, millions of them at a time ideally, at 700mil times real time? not so easy! well as I say, we would try and make evolution go a bit faster, rely on luck less, reward intelligence more, focus less on things like evolving sweat glands and crap so maybe we could get 70x more efficient than irl evolution, ofc that's a number pulled out of my arse, but you get the idea. still hard to simulate. anyway, I've rambled more than enough. the fact the world leading experts apparently don't agree probably means I'm wrong, seen zero of them calling for anything remotely similar, but personally I figure stick with what works. this problem has been solved exactly once that we know of and instead of trying to use the first solution as even inspiration they're trying to solve it in a completely different and novel way and that just seems wrong to me.",

It has different strengths and different weaknesses. However, pretty much every lab is trying to develop something more general, something that can fidure out things on its own. This has been a theme for a while, pointing out that humans can learn from a small fraction of the data than an LLM.",

        "text_content": "Hey everyone! \ud83d\udc4b Just wanted to share a tool I built to save on API costs. I noticed MCP servers often return *huge* JSON payloads with data I don't need (like avatar links), which wastes a ton of tokens. So I built a \"learning adapter\" that sits in the middle. It automatically figures out which fields are important and filters out the rest. It actually cut my token usage by about **80%**. It's open source, and I'd really love for you to try it. If it helps you, maybe we can share the optimized schemas to help everyone save money together.

Why is there no Switch 2 Version to support 120hz, a norm for modern rhythm games on every other plattform?

Why is a new Katamari comming that just like the previous games runs not so well on the Switch 1 but there is no Switch 2 version announced? I mean, we are speaking about Bandai Namco and Taito, I would asume that they already have a Switch 2 dev kit, so what is stopping companys from doing a native Switch 2 version?

There are several developers when interviewed about porting their game to Switch 2 their immediate comment is \u201cwe don\u2019t have dev kits\u201d. Warframe developers at Digital Extremes were recently interviewed and they said that yes a Switch 2 version would be coming, but they don\u2019t have dev kits yet. The other factor is cost. If it requires any level of programming and testing that costs money for the developer to do. If Nintendo is not paying for it and the publisher is not paying for it then a developer likely isn\u2019t going to just work on an upgrade for free. Yes they can sell an upgrade pack, but I\u2019m sure many developers and publishers are collecting data surrounding how profitable that is before assigning resources to creating an upgrade pack/patch.",

        "text_content": "Personally, I will FOREVER love Nintendo\u2019s attachment to gimmicky control schemes and weird quirky ideas for games. It\u2019s when their \u201csurprise and delight\u201d personality really comes through. I think most people kinda shrugged off this game when it was shown in the switch 2 direct (and admittedly I was kinda there with them) because it was basically just \u201cthe two mouse mode\u201d game. And I can definitely understand it from the perspective of the Switch 2 being the beefier \u201cmore hardcore\u201d gaming console which in turn lends itself into better more graphical more intense immersive \u201cpure gaming\u201d experiences. So perhaps seeing this title put them off a bit in the midst of that \u201cfoundation\u201d of thinking. But the more I see of it, and Nintendo advertises it, the more I think they really got something pretty special here. All the cool tricks and stunts you can pull, all the different game modes and even class weights that keep it interesting, and by FAR the probably saving grace of a game of this caliber, the price ONLY being 20 dollars. If variable pricing truly means we\u2019re getting smaller titles for smaller prices, sign me up. But that\u2019s just my personal take as a Wii Sports/ Nintendogs enjoyer. What\u2019s the concensus?

In the May Case-Shiller house price index released yesterday, the seasonally adjusted National Index (SA), was reported as being 77% above the bubble peak in 2006. However, in real terms, the National index (SA) is about 10.5% above the bubble peak (and historically there has been an upward slope to real house prices). The composite 20, in real terms, is 1.9% above the bubble peak. People usually graph nominal house prices, but it is also important to look at prices in real terms. As an example, if a house price was $300,000 in January 2010, the price would be $442,000 today adjusted for inflation (47% increase). That is why the second graph below is important - this shows \"real\" prices. The third graph shows the price-to-rent ratio, and the fourth graph is the affordability index. The last graph shows the 5-year real return based on the Case-Shiller National Index. Nominal House Prices The first graph shows the monthly Case-Shiller National Index SA, and the monthly Case-Shiller Composite 20 SA in nominal terms as reported. In nominal terms, the Case-Shiller National index (SA) and the Case-Shiller Composite 20 index (SA) both declined in May, and both are about 0.9% below the all-time highs set in February 2025. Real House Prices The second graph shows the same two indexes in real terms (adjusted for inflation using CPI). In real terms (using CPI), the National index is 2.0% below the recent peak, and the Composite 20 index is 2.2% below the recent peak in 2022. Both the real National index and the Comp-20 index decreased in May. It has now been 36 months since the real peak in house prices. Typically, after a sharp increase in prices, it takes a number of years for real prices to reach new highs (see House Prices: 7 Years in Purgatory). There is nothing magic about \u201c7 years\u201d, it just made a good post title! My initial guess on house prices was \u201cmostly flat prices nationally in 2025\u201d which would suggest a slight decline in real prices. In real terms, national house prices are 10.5% above the bubble peak levels. There is an upward slope to real house prices, and it has been 19 years since the bubble peak, but real prices are historically high.",

That process essentially involves tasking an LLM with the job of checking and grading another model\u2019s answers by using various sources to research them. After an OpenAI model won a tough math competition earlier this summer, Alexander Wei, a senior researcher at the company, said on X that the RL approach it has been using was \u201cgeneral purpose,\u201d implying it could verify the quality of answers in more-subjective categories as well. Such advances appear to have helped OpenAI with developing GPT-5, which showed improvements both in more easily verifiable domains like software programming\u2014where correct answers can be easily checked\u2014and in more subjective areas such as creative writing. The rest of the industry, including xAI and Google, has also doubled down on RL as a promising technique for improving AI models, and Tworek, who leads OpenAI\u2019s RL, recently made a public comment agreeing with the idea that the RL system behind OpenAI\u2019s models is in fact what constitutes AGI.",

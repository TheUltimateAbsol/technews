Mexican was yelling at anybody, actin fake tough since Scaleybark. Person behind me checked him then dreadhead checked him. Like stfu its kids on here, plus nobody tryna hear that. Few stops go by. By 9th St, he took a swig of his Beatbox then walked up to dreadhead, they stand off then he pulled out a hunting knife. Stabbed him. Dreahead rush to the opposite end of train. People gave help and alerted the driver to stop. We all wait 7 mins for police. He dropped his knife, asked us to hold it then picked it up, left his bike and grabbed the emergency latch to runaway. Victim was throwing up, bleeding heavy when he got stretchered. Cops caught stabber on the other side of the apts. He was asking people for rides. So completely ironic that it ended up being a hispanic dude, probably an ilegal, a week after DHS wrapped up major operations in Charlotte - the whole week of which r/Charlotte fucking absolutely went apeshit about how it was terrible to oppress so many spics. CMPD released stats about 10 years ago that they had arrested 400 illegal aliens for DUI in the prior year. That's over 1 per day of DUI on the roadways in Charlotte, and that was 10 fucking years ago. I'm sure it's worse now, the streets are flooded with cars with no plates, and basically every accident is caused by someone with no insurance, no driver's license, and no plates. This shit is out of control and Charlotte's Web was a drop in the fucking bucket.",

        "text_content": "Hello friends, I\u2019m back with another Denver market update! Lets take a look at how November wrapped up: **Month-over-Month:** Closed listings fell 21% from October. This slowdown is normal going into the holiday season. The median closed price slipped just 1% month over month, showing that sellers are still holding value. Homes averaged 38 days on the market, three days longer than in October. For buyers, there is less competition and more time to decide. For sellers, pricing with intention remains key. **Year-over-Year:** Homes are taking longer to sell, averaging 38 days on the market compared to 29 days last November. At the same time, inventory has grown by 14%, so buyers have more choices. Closed sales were down 11% compared to last year, which is a sign that buyer activity has cooled. Prices, however, held steady. The median rose 1% to $584,000. Attached homes (like condos and townhomes) saw a price dip, down 8% to $400,000. Single\u2011family homes stayed nearly unchanged at an average of $635,000. **Rental Market:** Rents slightly decreased in November, with the average down 1% to $2,650. Rentals stayed on the market longer \u2014 41 days on average, up 10 from last year \u2014 giving tenants more time to compare. Even so, leased properties rose 16% year over year. Landlords should keep pricing sharp and make listings stand out. **Overall:** November brought slower activity, but still solid stability. Buyers are gaining options, sellers are still holding value, and both sides have opportunities! source: reColorado",

All this proves is that at max brightness, every panel type fails in a relatively short period. I run my Sony 65\" A95K QD-OLED TV at \"20/50\" brightness (probably around 150-200 nits max) and that will most likely prolong its lifespan. I wonder if manufacturers knowingly push the max brightness level to \"dangerous\" *(in quotes because the worst thing that can happen is the TV stops working)* levels, as most reviewers focus on how bright a TV can get. It's all about the brightness wars nowadays. Now we have TVs advertising 2000+ nits which is insanity.",

Other than the raytracing performance which does seem to exceed Mediatek's claims, the rest of the benchmark suite don't come close to Mediatek's claims. Going claim by claim, the 32% higher ST performance seems to be a complete lie. In GB6 ST, the score is 23% faster (primarily due to supporting SME2). In SPEC2017, the results are extremely disappointing. We are looking at 10% faster perf in integer and 20% faster in floating point while seemingly using 25-30% more power on average compared to last year's X925. None of the figures, be it SPECint, SPECfp or GB6 indicate a 32% higher performance figure. It also seems that the microarchitecture has grown in area. It could explain why the middle performance curves of the X925 and C1 Ultra basically overlap till the 5W range before we see actual gains. Remember Zen 4 vs Zen 5? The C1 Premium and Pro are both lacklustre. Zero P/W improvements. I'm assuming that the primary focus of these two was to improve PPA over the old X4 and A725, because otherwise, they are practically identical in performance and efficiency. The combination of no gains in the middle of the V/f curve and the lack of improvement on the rest of the CPU cores barring the Ultra explain the poor MT performance figures. In GB6 despite being aided by the new SME2 which should give good gains, it offers a 15% jump compared to the 23% jump seen in ST. This makes it just on par with the 8 Elite from a year ago and lacking behind the A19 Pro. From the chart it seems that the 9500 uses nearly 18W than the 12W of the A19 Pro (nearly 50% more power), yet is falls short of the A19 pro in MT perf. The GPU side of things are more in line with the claims. Raster perf is up by 26% (albeit using way more power yet again). At iso power, performance seems to be up by around 15-20% which is a decent gain. D9400 already had a small lead over Qualcomm and Apple in this department. The new GPU beats the A19 Pro despite the latter's massive 40%+ gen on gen improvements. It also beats has an amazing RT performance uplift (219%) in Solar Bay Extreme and beats A19 Pro by 7% there as well. (Albeit using somewhat more power). The CPU bound nature of mobile games seems to shine through, since comparing it with 8 Elite and A19 Pro with obvious GPU prowess advantages or parity, it seems to just match or lag behind these two in P/W in gaming tests, exceeding them in only one scenario.

Kudos to Apple for restraint at 12W\u2014I don't know what's happening in the Android world. The curves are clearly **flattening** after 10W. Before anyone @ me \"so what peak power? Race to idle is important in mobile!\" like in the A19 thread: Without a power vs time graph or energy (joules) measured, I'm always hesistant to confirm \"race to idle\" is actually working. It is not guaranteed. Race to idle is a *concept* of energy savings. It is not some immutable law and especially not at the flat part of the curve. The only way to prove race to idle has worked is to count Joules, like AnandTech did. The Apple A15 was a good example.

I usually look over at [https://github.com/lhl/strix-halo-testing/tree/main/llm-bench](https://github.com/lhl/strix-halo-testing/tree/main/llm-bench) To find such cases but it's hasn't been updated for ROCm 7. Not only that comparing across HW is usually tough and you really go by it through other users.

Most of things he says have already been said but there's some new info. REO has also said that he may or may not have heard similar things from his sources. You can see Dusk's message around 2:04 Anyway here's what DuskGolem said: - Leon will be unshaven and will have greying hair. He wears a black jacket - Leon's sections are not open world but larger that Grace's. He will use a vehicle to move during a level (similar to the boat section in RE4R) - his gameplay is action but more horror than re4 or re8. There aren't silly things like the possessed statues/armours of re4 or the mecha fight in re8. There is less camp overall. He expects that people will compare it to Tlou2's gameplay - he expects that Leon will be revealed at TGS - the image of Leon wearing an eyepatch is fake. ROE says that his sources have confirmed it, too - Here's the most interesting part: Dusk says that he's heard that Leon's story takes place mostly in 2020, while most (but not all) of Grace's in 2028. They're not two different campaigns but one large cohesive and interconnected story. Edit: the resetera link now works.",

Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x. In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores. This solves NONE of intel\u2019s structural issues - they need, in this order 1. Major foundry customers 2. Regain server market share 3.

Has some strengths over XeSS but also worse with RT particularly shadows (easy test spot: your apartment building boxing area), very stable image overall. Ofc big performance hit but probably worth it at least for some scenarios (rx6800 here). Look forward to official support but reverted game version (had 2.2 modded already) & drivers, not such a big difference to be worth the extra hassle. Given that it can maintain 30 fps w/ PT and look quite good at ~~4K (perf mode)~~ (later edit: kept switching resos & ratios, double checked and it was actually 2560x1080 not 4K for PT, apologies; still fine for consoles, but ofc not 21:9) on my rdna 2 card I wonder why they don't do a similar mode for ps5 pro and sell a lot more copies.",

Key features: * **State-of-the-art across modalities**: Early text-first pretraining and mixed multimodal training provide native multimodal support. While achieving strong audio and audio-video results, unimodal text and image performance does not regress. Reaches SOTA on 22 of 36 audio/video benchmarks and open-source SOTA on 32 of 36; ASR, audio understanding, and voice conversation performance is comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. * **Multilingual**: Supports 119 text languages, 19 speech input languages, and 10 speech output languages. * **Speech Input**: English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, German, Russian, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Malay, Dutch, Indonesian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Arabic, Urdu. * **Speech Output**: English, Chinese, French, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean. * **Novel Architecture**: MoE-based Thinker\u2013Talker design with AuT pretraining for strong general representations, plus a multi-codebook design that drives latency to a minimum. * **Real-time Audio/Video Interaction**: Low-latency streaming with natural turn-taking and immediate text or speech responses. * **Flexible Control**: Customize behavior via system prompts for fine-grained control and easy adaptation. * **Detailed Audio Captioner**: Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner is now open source: a general-purpose, highly detailed, low-hallucination audio captioning model that fills a critical gap in the open-source community.",

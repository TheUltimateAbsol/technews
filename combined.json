It will also better support non-x86 CPU architectures such as ARM, RISC-V, and LoongArch, the first major Chinese operating system. Personally I don't expect to see much changes to the x86/x64 world as that is tied to the very few vendors that makes the CPU and chipset. Having a standardized BIOS backed by the country that make a lot of the non-x86/x64 architectures SBC would help a lot. Unlike a PC, the onboard peripherals are all over the place as they were initially designed for embedded. Hence there is a need for Device Tree for describing the hardware configuration and to decouple the board from the drivers. There is also a mess of different ways of booting up a non-x86 SBC (Single Board Computer) as they don't all use the same standard BIOS. These problems makes installing Linux difficult.",

Crazy to think I'll be able to play that, and its 2 follow-ups in the palm of my hands, portably. And that it'll probably look even better than it did on my old TV lol. Side note as well, just thinking out loud, it would be legendary and so wickedly cool if they dropped 2, 3, and 4 Remake on the same day at the end of 2026, right before the holidays and right on time for Halloween. 6 fancy big RE games on Switch 2 in a single year would be a dream come true. I'd have the whole collection up on my shelf in the span of the year. That'd be fantastic.",

        "score": 1406,
        "text_content": "\"Microsoft Corp. is asking its Xbox gaming division to produce profit margins that are well above the industry average, ratcheting up pressure on its video-game makers during a difficult time for the field at large. Over the past two years, executives at the Seattle-based software giant have set an across-the-board goal of 30% \"accountability margins,\" a term Microsoft uses in lieu of profit margins, according to people familiar with the business. The gaming division, which includes dozens of studios, has responded by canceling products, raising prices and slashing thousands of jobs, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information.\" \"The new goal, which hasn't been previously reported, is at the outer range of what a gaming studio can typically reach in a boom year, said Neil Barbour, an analyst with S&P Global. \"A 30% or better margin is usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it,\" Barbour said. In the past, game makers at Xbox weren't asked to hit specific numerical targets, said the people, and were largely told to focus on making the best games possible without worrying too much about finances. The new target was implemented in fall 2023 by Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood, whose team has taken a larger role in the gaming business in recent years.\" \"The change has impacted strategies under Microsoft gaming chief Phil Spencer as the division has looked for new ways to cut costs and boost profits. In 2024, Xbox announced that it would begin releasing the majority of its games on consoles from rivals Nintendo Co. and Sony Group Corp. for the first time. Earlier this year, Xbox decided to cancel a number of costly projects, including Everwild, Perfect Dark and Project Blackbird, all of which had been in development for more than seven years. Not every project is expected to hit the 30% profit threshold, said the people, but many Xbox developers and groups have been presented with the new target. Moving forward, games that are either cheap to make or deemed more likely to generate significant revenue windfalls may take priority over riskier bets, said the people, while Xbox's floundering hardware division may face a significant rethinking. In a recent interview with Mashable, Xbox President Sarah Bond said the company's next console will be \"a very premium, very high-end curated experience,\" suggesting a departure from previous Xbox iterations.\" Read more at the source for information: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&leadSource=uverify%20wall",

Sales of previously owned homes rose 1.5% in September from August to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 4.06 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is slightly less than the analysts were forecasting, but the highest pace in seven months. Sales were 4.1% higher compared with September of last year. Regionally, on an annual basis, sales were strongest in the South and Northeast. From August, sales were strongest in the West and actually fell slightly in the Midwest, the only region to see a monthly decline. This count is based on closings, so people signing contracts likely in July and August, when mortgage rates were coming down but were not as low as they are now. The average rate on the 30-year fixed started July at 6.67% and is now at 6.17%, according to Mortgage News Daily. \u201cAs anticipated, falling mortgage rates are lifting home sales,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist. \u201cImproving housing affordability is also contributing to the increase in sales.\u201d Inventory continued to make gains, up 14% from a year ago to 1.55 million units for sale at the end of September. That is still lean historically. At the current sales pace, there is a 4.6-month supply of homes for sale. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller. \u201cInventory is matching a five-year high, though it remains below pre-Covid levels,\u201d Yun added. \u201cMany homeowners are financially comfortable, resulting in very few distressed properties and forced sales. Home prices continue to rise in most parts of the country, further contributing to overall household wealth.\u201d Still tight supply continues to pressure prices. The median price of a home sold in September was $415,200, up 2.1% year over year and the 27th consecutive month of annual gains. Prices are 53% higher than pre-Covid levels. Sales continue to see the biggest gains on the high end of the market, likely because of more supply in those tiers. Sales of home priced above $1 million rose 20% from the year before, while sales of homes priced below $100,000 were up just under 3%. First-time homebuyers are making some gains, likely due to falling mortgage rates. They made up 30% of September sales, up from 26% the year before. About 30% of sales were made all in cash. Homes are sitting on the market longer, an average 33 days, up from 28 a year ago.",

Here\u2019s a quick recap. In **2022**, Opendoor was accused of **overstating the accuracy of its iBuying technology** and **concealing that much of its pricing was still done manually**. The company also allegedly failed to warn that its profit margins were heavily dependent on favorable housing conditions. After this news came out and reports revealed financial losses and regulatory issues, **$OPEN dropped nearly 90%**, and investors filed a lawsuit for their losses. The good news is that the company recently agreed to settle **$39 million** with them, and the **court has already approved this settlement**. So, if you invested in **$OPEN** when all of this happened, you can check the details and file your claim [here](https://11th.com/cases/opendoor-investor-settlement). Anyway, has anyone here invested in **$OPEN** at that time? How much were your losses, if so?",

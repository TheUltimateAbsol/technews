It has a purpose - to make you demand to give up your liberty, for the illusion of safety. It doesn't have to be like this. All the poverty. All the drugs. All the violent crime. All the murders. It's all intentional. Democrats destroyed our cities on purpose. Our cities can be fixed with certain changes. Those changes are known. Democrats and the Uniparty will try to fight those changes and call them names like \"racist\", and pretend that they don't know how to fix it, but they are only fighting to keep their parasitical system in place. They have bigger plans. If you think Democrat run cities are like this because the people running them are stupid, you're missing the big picture. You're thinking exactly what the media wants you to think. Our cities have been ruined intentionally.",

                "raw_content": "Abstract: > SSDs are hardware and software systems whose design involves complex and undocumented trade-offs between cost, energy consumption and performance. This complexity is hidden behind standard interfaces and a few headline specifications, such as capacity, sequential, and random performance. As a result, database system designers often assume that SSDs are interchangeable commodities and regularly use a single SSD model to evaluate database performance. Does it matter which SSD model is provisioned for a database system? If yes, how to choose the right one? These are the questions we address in this paper. We study the performance characteristics of commercial data center SSDs, highlighting the limitations of current standard metrics in capturing their true behavior. We conduct experiments on nine SSDs from major vendors, revealing significant differences in performance despite similar headline specifications. We show that the choice of SSD matters for database system performance. We propose a new benchmark, SSD-iq, which introduces four additional metrics to better characterize SSD performance, particularly for write-intensive workloads. Incidentally, our work should encourage vendors to optimize SSD controllers using more comprehensive and transparent performance criteria. Choosing an SSD: Implications for DBMS > Let us compare the Samsung PM9A3 (s) and Micron 7450 PRO (m) SSDs in more detail. These two models have similar specifications, the same capacity (960 GB), and, at the time of writing, similar prices. In terms of sequential throughput, m is slightly better for reads, while s is slightly better for writes. For random I/O, m performs better on writes, whereas s is better for reads. From the specifications alone, it is impossible to make an informed decision regarding which SSD to choose for a database workload. SSD-iq shows two very significant differences between these SSDs: (1) write latency under load degrades by two orders of magnitude for m, while it remains stable for s; (2) WAF is 25% higher for s than for m (WAF is between 4.2 and 4.4 for s, while it is between 3.2 and 3.5 for m). According to SSD-iq, the choice between these two SSDs matters and it is a trade-off between performance under load (s is better) and write amplification, i.e., lifetime (m is better). Conclusions (fragment): > We evaluated SSD-iq on nine commercial SSDs and showed that the choice of SSD matters for database performance. SSD-iq is well-suited to inform this choice. Our findings also unveil fundamental inefficiencies in existing SSDs when handling write-intensive workloads. In particular, most of the SSDs we tested behave as if they implement a simple, greedy garbage collection algorithm, which negatively impacts write amplification.

The only real drawback is its weight: at 1.46kg it\u2019s significantly heavier than the LG Gram 16 (1.2kg).

Trade-offs: * Reduced key travel vs classic ThinkPads * No TrackPoint (\u201cred dot\u201d) for the first time in decades of ThinkPad history But when you factor the price (\u00a510,999 subsidized for the Ultra 7 + 32GB/1TB model), it\u2019s killer value. You\u2019re getting double the RAM (32GB vs 16GB) and larger SSD compared to a MacBook Air, at a lower effective price. Unless you have an unlimited budget, the Ultra 7 version is the sweet spot \u2014 the Ultra 9 model offers no meaningful benefit for typical Lunar Lake ultrabook workloads. **Verdict:** Among large-screen ultrabooks, the X9-15 is a **GOAT contender**: long battery, sleek design, ThinkPad pedigree.

But there are some problems, either big or small Pros: -Is super fast, both to open and to use -Is well integrated with the UI, for example you can wishlist directly from the news app -Video autoplay is a game changer for me. Is nice to see how the game is without having to click on it -The \"for you\" section is pretty usefull and fun -Better integration of friends, and a better search system -It looks simple but is clean and nice -Black theme is supported -Nice sounds -Overall great layout Cons: -It slows down a bit when you pass on the \"for you\" section, but is almost just there -Lack of music, but that is not that important in the end. Still it would be nice -They moved the button to see all the publisher's games to be bottom of the game page -Still a lot of shitty AI games, that's the biggest problem.",

        "score": 402,
        "text_content": "In short, I went to Gamescom for 1 day (Thursday) and had the chance to play* 6 of the games that were being Demoed: Elden Ring, FFVII, Silksong*, Metroid Prime 4, Borderlands 4, Cyberpunk 2077*, Glaciered. Here are my notes, starting with Elden Ring: Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition Booth (No filming allowed) - Had to wait about 45 min - They were given 6 Switch2s (5 handheld, 1 docked) - Played on Docked Mode! - First Impressions: The game is playable. - How it looks: It looks really good, the graphics really look amazing. - How it runs: It runs like a toaster, not always though. In caves it seems to run really well, the problem is in the open spaces, and when you have too many enemies around. The enemies that are closer to you run well, but the ones in the back look like their running on 10fps and are made out of cardboard. It looks like it prioritizes the smoothness of the enemies the closer they are to you. The camera though, if you pan like crazy to see everything it feels like the game slows down to 20fps. Final Fantasy VII Remake Booth: - Waited about 25 min - They were given 8 Switch2s (4 Handheld, 4 Docked) - Played on Docked Mode - First Impressions: I was Blown away by how good it looks and how smooth it runs. - How it looks: I can only say that, if they would've told me that it was running on a PS5 or XBox Series X, I would have believed them. Damn it looks beautiful! - How it runs: It runs smoothly, I wasn't able to see any framedrops (docked). It ran like it owned the Switch2. Incredible work. Don't know if it's because the place wasn't really big, you are always inside the train stations. There was never more than 3 enemies at one given moment. So I don't know how it would run in a more open space and with many enemies around you. Hollow Knight: Silksong Booth (I recorded it) - For some dumb reason, they were not letting people play the game or even wait in line. They were telling people that if they didn't have a specific ticket \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f, they couldn't get in, everyone was so confused. Suddenly, around 14:00 hrs they took out a sign that said \"No More Silksong today, come back tomorrow\" which was baffling. It really got people angry, it was so inconsistent also, because even though they had the sign up, you could still see people being able to either bribe the guys that were letting people in, or just begging enough to let them in. Terrible management, to be honest. - I wasn't able to play, but I was granted the chance to just stand beside someone who was playing the demo and just watch the full demo. (I even recorded like 2 min of the demo with their permission). - First Impressions: AMAZING! - How it looks: The game looks Beautiful in both Handheld and Docked. - How it runs: It runs like a dream, no hiccups, no frame drops, nada. Feels like it is utilizing the Switch2 specs the most optimal way possible. I asked the guy who was standing in guard if he knew if it was running in 60 or 120 fps, he answered with: \"Legally I can say that it's running in 120 hz, I can't say fps\". Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Booth (Recorded 10 min of the demo with the approval of the staff) - Waited for 2 hrs 18 min - They had 14 Switch2s, all Docked. - First Impressions: I can't WAIT for the game to come out, I need to experience the game NOW! - How it looks: It looks unreal, this game was born to be played on the Switch 2, it will leave everyone blown away by it. - How it runs: Buttery smooth, no problems, not a single one! It is incredible. Also, I didn't know until I played it but there are actually 3 ways to aim in MP4: Using the Mouse controls (which it really is instant, it takes milliseconds to register that you're using the mouse), Using the rights stick, and then using giro-aiming like a Wii controller. - Observation: I found it tricky to play in mouse mode, not because it doesn't work, but it's because I couldn't find a comfortable way to be able to grab the joycon 2 in a way that I could controll the mouse and be able to press the buttons without loosing or changing the grip. I ended up using a mix of the r-stick and the giro-aiming to fight the boss. Borderlands 4 Booth: (No filming allowed) - Waited for 55 min in a line of 12 people. - They were given 4 Switch2s (2 Docked, 2 handheld) - Played on Docked Mode - First Impressions: Awful, definitely the worst demo by far. - How it looks: I don't know if Borderlands is just like that but for me it looked terrible. It really looked like how fortnite looked on the switch. I am so disappointed, and I didn't really have any expectations. - How it runs: It runs terrible also, it is not at a constant frame rate, it drops consistently making it very hard to even keep on playing, trying to aim while the frames keep dropping was very infuriating. This was the only demo that I actually had to put pause and just stop playing. Really a terrible first impression. - Observation: It was truly a terrible experience, I had to check and see how borderlands 4 looks like in PS5 gameplay trailers and it definitely is not the enemy designs or the art style. It is just terribly ported to the Switch2, the enemies looked like they were made out of sponges and Styrofoam. I can't really find another way to describe it. Also, while I was getting annoyed by the demo, I had people just behind me, on the same booth (it was a shared booth) playing Cyberpunk 2077 and that was running unbelievably well. All the praise that Cyberpunk has been getting, it is true! It is something to behold, very impressive. Glaciered (found on the indies area) - Didn't have to wait - One Switch2 - First Impressions: That version of the game has many glitches but I'm impressed and actually excited to check it out once it comes out. - How it looks: It looks ok, on the top right corner it did have the message saying: \"This is an in-development build. It doesn't represent the final product.\" - How it runs: Other than the glitches, it ran super smooth, I had no issues that I could see in regards to frame drops. If you have questions, share them below and would be happy to share my experience and thoughts on the games I was able to play and/or watch very closely!",

I mean, from Nintendo's perspective, pushing a large scale flood of PS4 era ports into year two of Switch 2's life may be beneficial. Nintendo is apparently confident that they can sell the first 15-20 million units on the back of Mario Kart World, DK Bananza and Switch 2 Edition games. By delaying the flood of ports, this allows the Switch 2 to have a userbase large enough for those games to have a real chance to sell. Pumping out 100+ titles on a userbase of 10 million would result in a lot of publishers expressing disappointment in their games sales success on Switch 2. The majority of games that developers want to put on Switch 2 will ultimately come and by having development studios receiving development kits at different times, it basically guarantees a steady flow of titles from third parties for the next couple of years. Nate's reply: > When partners are planning their fiscal year and want to include SW2 on the roadmap but can't due to Nintendo being silent... yes, it's less than ideal.",

This system of using rings to connect L3 slices is called a **ring bus** (On Sandy Bridge, the 4 rings consist of a data ring, request ring, acknowledge ring, and a snoop ring) P and E core clusters have been spaced together since ARL due to thermal hot spot issues on the previous L3 Topology, as seen in the i9 13900K: P--P--P--P--P--P--E--E P--P--P--P--P--P--E--E The L3 topology for H484 likely looks like: P--E--P P--E--P The L3 ring bus had a clock speed of 3.8Ghz on Arrow Lake and 4.5Ghz on Lunar Lake.

A decrease in the mortgage spread can cause mortgage rates to fall, even without the Fed cutting interest rates. That\u2019s good news for house hunters and homeowners looking to refinance because, setting aside Fed policy, it means mortgage lenders are offering lower rates. The mortgage spread fell to around 1.5 percentage points\u2013lower than usual\u2013in 2021, when mortgage rates were sitting at record lows. It doubled in 2022 and 2023 to levels usually seen during financial turmoil because mortgage rates increased, markets became more uncertain, and lenders were trying to hedge their risks by charging more interest. Now, the spread is slowly falling but it has more room to fall before returning to more typical levels, around 1.5-2 percentage points. That means there\u2019s more potential for mortgage rates to fall more than treasury yields. \u201cThink of the spread like a restaurant meal,\u201d said Chen Zhao, Redfin\u2019s head of economics research. \u201cThe treasury yield is the cost of raw ingredients, the mortgage rate is the price of the meal on the table, and the spread is the restaurant\u2019s markup, which covers the cost of the chef, rent on the restaurant, profit margin, etc. Regardless of the cost of raw ingredients, if the restaurant has a lower markup, that lowers the customer\u2019s bill. Similarly, regardless of the Fed\u2019s actions, a lower mortgage spread helps lower mortgage rates.\u201d Why the Mortgage Spread Dropping Matters For Homebuyers and Homeowners A lower mortgage spread equals lower mortgage rates. If the spread continues to decline, mortgage rates could fall more than they already have. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that if the Fed cuts interest rates as expected in September\u2013or more than expected\u2013mortgage rates may fall more than anticipated because the spread is also falling,\u201d Zhao said. It\u2019s also worth noting that we\u2019re in a buyer\u2019s market, with many sellers open to negotiations, including lowering their price, because many homes have been sitting on the market for a long time. Combined with lower rates, now may be a good time to lock in a lower monthly housing payment. A homebuyer on a $3,000 monthly budget can afford a $439,000 home with a 6.55% mortgage rate, roughly today\u2019s average. That means that homebuyer has gained roughly $20,000 in purchasing power since May, when rates hit a recent peak of 7.08%. Redfin agents in some parts of the country have reported that homebuyers started responding to lower mortgage rates over the weekend. The gap between 10-year treasury yields and mortgage rates (known as the mortgage spread) has dropped to its lowest level in over three years, allowing mortgage rates to fall more than treasury yields. The spread was 2.26 percentage points as of August 22, down from about 2.5 at the start of summer and 2.68 a year earlier.",

                "raw_content": "High mortgage rates, rising construction costs and economic uncertainty continue to deter many potential home buyers during this summer season. Sales of newly built single-family homes edged 0.6% lower in July, falling to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 652,000 from an upwardly revised reading in June, according to newly released data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census Bureau. The pace of new home sales is down 8.2% from a year earlier. A new home sale occurs when a sales contract is signed, or a deposit is accepted. The home can be in any stage of construction: not yet started, under construction or completed. In addition to adjusting for seasonal effects, the July reading of 652,000 units is the number of homes that would sell if this pace continued for the next 12 months. New single-family home inventory held steady at 499,000 residences marketed for sale as of July. This is 0.6% lower than the previous month, and 7.3% higher than a year ago. At the current sales pace, the months\u2019 supply for new homes remained elevated at 9.2 compared to 7.9 a year ago. A measure near a six months\u2019 supply is considered balanced. On a year-to-date basis, new home sales are 4.0% lower thus far in 2025. As a result of slowing home sales conditions, inventory remained elevated in July at a 9.2 months\u2019 supply. As estimated by NAHB, total months\u2019 supply, defined as a combination of current new and resale single-family inventory, now stands at 5.2. This is the highest sales-adjusted inventory level since 2015 and will place downward pressure on housing construction starts in the months ahead. A year ago, there were 99,000 completed, ready-to-occupy homes available for sale (not seasonally adjusted). By the end of July 2025, that number increased 19.2% to 118,000. However, completed, ready-to-occupy inventory remains just 23% of total inventory, while homes under construction account for 54%. The remaining 22% of new homes for-sale in July were homes that had not started construction when the sales contract was signed.",

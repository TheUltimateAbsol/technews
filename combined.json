DLSS4.0-4.5 is a far messier transition than DLSS3-4.0, there's highly variable frametime cost depending on not just input/output res but GPU architecture as well, the per-game image quality improvements/regressions compared to DLSS4.0 seem wildly inconsistent, there's that odd pseudo-oversharpening artifact especially noticeable at 1080p, it's all rather unintuitive now compared to the rather simple duality of DLSS3CNN vs DLSS4-T.

About Age of empires and XBOX's efforts on Real time strategy Games. i don't know a great deal but i will say this \" i think it's being developed on Unreal Engine because one of the big issues they had with Age Of Empires 4, from what i heard, was Relic's Engine and this engine and development pipeline was very difficult for them to work with and to adapt to the Age of empires, what people expect from Age of Empires. So they (World's Edge) are moving to something more proprietary built on Unreal Engine though. Something more custom and things like that. i don't know who's building it but at least the bones are being made by World's Edge Studios. I would presume they're going to partner with another developer on it\". Again \"\"Age of Empires remains one of Microsoft's most prolifics IPs and they've really cornered that niche, the whikw real tielme Strategy that it doesn't have the same popularity that it did back in the day. But as Xbox moves deeper into PC gaming i do think like Age of Empires and games like it are definitely going to be a Major part of their purview. And another thing i'll say by the ways, is that they are interested in also bringing StarCraft back as an RTS altough the next StarCraft i expect will be the third person shooter wich i've actually seen gameplay footage of the next StarCraft and it looks stunning. if you enjoy games like Space Marine , the StarCraft fans are going to gave a lo look forward to. But they want to bring back StarCraft as an RTS as well. Microsoft obviously wants to continue cornering the RTS audience. Age of Empires is still a big deal for Microsoft and it's going to back in a big way\".",

Total housing starts were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.246 million in October, down 4.6% from September and 7.8% less than a year earlier, the U.S. Census Bureau reported on Friday. The October figure, delayed by several months due to the shutdown, was the lowest level for housing starts since May 2020, during the heart of COVID-19 lockdowns. https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/current/index.html The decline was driven by a sharp decrease in multifamily construction, with starts on buildings with five units or more falling almost 25% on the month to a five-month low. Single-family starts, on the other hand, rose 5.4% on the month to an annualized 874,000 pace, though they remained near their lowest level in two years. \"All told, this delayed but much anticipated data release paints a bit of a gloomy picture for home construction that is driven by builders\u2019 lack of confidence in their ability to sell homes at a price that makes it economically viable for them,\" says Realtor.com\u00ae senior economist Joel Berner. \"What\u2019s plaguing the market in 2025 is uncertainty.\" Homebuilder sentiment remains low despite recent rate cuts at the Federal Reserve, with builders reporting headwinds from high materials costs and weak demand from buyers who are struggling with affordability and uncertain about the economy. Overall builder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes remained low at 39 last month, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. Any reading below 50 reflects negative sentiment about the market. \"The housing market is struggling with trepidatious buyers, leading to an inventory glut and rising time on market, especially in the South and West, where a majority of new homes are built,\" says Berner. \"Builders, in response, are pulling back.\" In recent days, President Donald Trump has renewed his vow to tackle the housing affordability crisis, proposing a ban on institutional investor ownership of single-family homes. Trump also said on Thursday night that he had directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, a move intended to bring mortgage rates lower. \"This will drive mortgage rates down, monthly payments down, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he promised on his Truth Social site. \"It is one of my many steps in restoring affordability, something that the Biden administration absolutely destroyed.\" Permits rise off August low, offering hope of a rebound The new census report, delayed by several months due to the government shutdown, is the first reading on residential construction activity since August, and includes combined results for September and October. The report shows that permits, a sign of future construction activity, rose 6.4% in September from the five-year low reached in August. Permit activity was little changed in October, down just 0.2% from the September level. The September uptick breaks a five-month streak of declines that marked the longest stretch of falling permit activity since late 2008, when the housing crash and Great Recession all but halted new building activity. Permits rose in September for both single-family homes (+2.6%) and multifamily buildings with five units or more (+14%). In a positive sign, the strongest permitting gains for all project types were in the inventory-strapped Northeast, where they were up 5.8% year over year. \"This is an encouraging sign that builders are responding to price signals that show new-home demand is the strongest in that region,\" says Berner. Meanwhile, the sharpest decline in permits was among single-family homes in the West, where inventory now exceeds pre-pandemic levels, and the price premium on new-construction homes compared with existing homes is low. \"Again, we see the market working as intended, attracting builders to parts of the country where housing is most needed and their profits can be higher,\" says Berner.",

        "score": 14,
        "text_content": "I recently started a discussion in a UK subreddit about the housing crisis called: *\u201cIs the supply/demand narrative masking a historic debt problem as the cause of high house prices?\u201d* [https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1q78luh/comment/nytv7sd/?context=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1q78luh/comment/nytv7sd/?context=1) Reddit suggested I share it here too. I\u2019m not sure if this counts as a re-post, so I\u2019ll just link it for context. The discussion includes references to a BBC Money Programme undercover investigation from 2003 and a thread debate on the topic. I've given the links to the BBC programme below, in case you want to access it quickly. There are striking parallels between the housing situation in the UK and the US today, and with the sub-prime era of the 90s/00s. My suspicion is that a portion of the high house prices in the US, as in the UK, reflects equity that was never \u201ccleared\u201d after 2009. Instead, it remained in the system and has compounded over the last couple of decades. This equity was originally due to borrowers lying about their incomes on Stated-income mortgage forms (\"liar loans\") which required no income verification. 'Stated-income mortgage' was the equivalent of 'Self-certification' in the UK. It would be interesting to hear whether US homeowners and economists see similar structural leverage driving prices, beyond simple supply-and-demand explanations. **(1) BBC Money programme - \"Mortgage Madness\" (29/10/2003)** (1/3) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1UnGS91BY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1UnGS91BY) (2/3) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGbd95Ac1D4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGbd95Ac1D4) (3/3) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_OAc6JRb3Bg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAc6JRb3Bg)",

The deals involve **Oklo**, **TerraPower** and **Vistra** covering both new advanced reactors and upgrades to existing plants. Meta says the goal is to secure **24/7 carbon free firm power** to meet the massive energy demands of large scale AI systems without relying on intermittent sources.",

        "text_content": "A few days ago I came across this: [AI tutoring outperforms in-class active learning: an RCT introducing a novel research-based design in an authentic educational setting](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12179260/), and it made me slightly sad because, upon reflection, I realized that I didn't suddenly become 10x smarter, but rather that AI has been supercharging my learning. Aside from the obvious stuff, like being able to search for information far quicker or generate custom-made explanations, there's another point I'd like to touch upon. All throughout my education I suffered from terrible anxiety and a \u201ccompetency complex\u201d. This made it very difficult for me to ask questions for fear of appearing \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201chopeless\u201d. This extended into my first job too and eventually resulted in me being fired because I was \u201cthat guy\u201d who\u2019d rather spend hours trying to self-teach rather than just asking. Since then I\u2019ve forced myself to act in spite of this fear, but the terror has not gone away. I regularly entertain negative scenarios where whoever I asked has now written me off as an idiot with zero common sense and no capacity to think for themselves. I love to learn, I want to grow, I absolutely despise asking. This, as you might imagine, has made it hard for me to study things in my leisure time. At work it\u2019s a lose-lose situation: either I ask and look stupid, or I don\u2019t ask, underperform, and then look stupid anyway. Outside of work it\u2019s different. I don\u2019t need to ask questions online and risk being humiliated; I can just make up untested assumptions about the things I don\u2019t know or understand yet and carry on bumbling through whatever I\u2019m trying to learn. Sure, I should probably ask someone, but that\u2019s scary, why would I do that? When these assumptions collapse, I can just give up, doomscroll, and repeat the cycle a few months later. And this is why I really appreciate AI as a study aide. I\u2019m never scared interacting with it. It\u2019s not going to tell my coworkers that I\u2019m secretly a fraud, nor is it ever going to call me an idiot and instruct me to give up on studying. Instead, it writes everything out, encourages me to ask more questions, precisely analyzes my mistakes, gives me sources for all of its information if I ask, never calls my questions stupid, and works at exactly my pace. This is priceless. AI is the best tutor (well, the only one. I\u2019ve always been too scared of real ones) I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019m genuinely envious of those who have access to this tool whilst still in their education. Now, that being said, they\u2019re not perfect. Occasionally GPT-5.2 will make a mistake here or there, but I think I\u2019ve spotted all the contradictions that have appeared so far. After all, I\u2019ve been blazing through textbooks and acing the practice questions. My performance at work has skyrocketed. Not because I\u2019m blindly following instructions, but because my AI-assisted self-study outside of work has been paying dividends. I even have debates with AI about the news. This is in stark contrast to how people typically deride LLMs as a tool to outsource thinking. For me, it\u2019s the opposite. I\u2019ve never been able to accomplish so much.",

I have the same experience, LLM's are amazing for fact-checking, researching new topics and learning in general. I'm learning heaps more just because the barrier of entry is so low. Can learn about an interesting topic in 5 minutes instead of 20.",

And sure, when people perceive education as a system they must pass through to get a degree, they'll use any available means to get to that end goal. But for folks who enjoy learning for the sake of learning (or who need to actually understand things to perform a job), it's an entirely different story, which usually doesn't get told.

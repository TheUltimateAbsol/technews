That said it is a better product than the Snapdragon X and X2 Elites. Why? Because the hardware may be broken but the software support is there. By the time the consumer devices ship, currently set for announcement after CES and availability in June-ish, things will be better. Qualcomm has lost the entire dev community to Nvidia, squandered a decade lead. No sane developer will engage with Qualcomm over Nvidia at this point, their antagonism over the past 18 months has ensured that. X2 Elite may have the better CPU, but Nvidia has the better GPU and great software ecosystem. In this age of heterogeneous computing, that is very important. The M4 in the fanless Macbook Air completely thrashes the X Elite in many productivity workloads (that happens to make use of the GPU). Adreno X1 GPU hardware is mediocre, and the the situation with drivers is abysmal. > All of this is built on a TSMC 3nm process, exact variant unspecified, which means it should be pretty efficient. The die size wasn\u2019t officially disclosed but they did give us a sample as a keepsake. As you can see above, there is a bit of epoxy on the edges but the die is about 220mm^2. Interesting. [HotHardware corroborates](https://hothardware.com/reviews/qualcomm-snapdragon-x2-elite-architecture-deep-dive#:~:text=Snapdragon%20X2%20Elite%20High%2DLevel,to%20my%20trusty%20digital%20calipers.); \"The chip is manufactured on TSMC\u2019s N3 process node, and is composed of approximately 31B transistors. Its die size measures about 13.3mm x 16.5mm (219.5mm\u00b2) according to my trusty digital calipers.\" X1 Elite was 169 mm\u00b2 N4P. So X2 Elite is about 30% larger with a node shrink. For that, you get a 6 more CPU cores, a 33% bigger GPU, a 50% bigger memory bus, etc... Is the die size of Apple M5 known? > Raytracing seems to be the focus of many GPU makers this season and Qualcomm is no exception. The RT unit has been heavily update this time around with bounding box tree traversals now done in hardware which is a tremendous speedup, not to mention power savings. Am I reading this right? Adreno X2 GPU has proper RT cores like Apple/Intel/Nvidia, and not the AMD approach? If so, this represents a significant divergence from the mobile hardware (8 Elite Gen 5), which doesn't have it. > X2 uses ACPI which will lessen a big pain point of the X1 but that is about it. Better Linux support? > Toss in Microsoft\u2019s software incomptence and you have something that should be avoided. What a travesty. Perhaps the partnership with Google will go better? https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-on-pc-qualcomm-snapdragon-summit-3600612/ People are tired of Microsoft's shenanigans and the steady deterioration of Windows. They have clearly given up even pretending to care about the user experience. For example, Google has been much more responsible with how they have integrated AI to Android, compared to Microsoft's Copilot disaster on Windows. If this upcoming Aluminium OS functions like proper Linux, while also being user friendly for the 'Linux noobs', and integrates deeply with our Android phones (like Mac and iPhone)... this could be a hit.",

After a lot of testing, here is what worked best to get a crisp image with vivid colors: \u200b1.

In handheld mode using quality mode, when you move the camera, the scrolling will be somewhat choppy. With stuttering images. They showed that in the video. But in performance mode, the scrolling becomes smoother and it stutters less. That's another setting that is useful. EDIT: Since some people are doubting what Digital Foundry said, here's the video in question where they clearly state that in handheld mode, they recommend Performance over Quality mode. And they explain why (starts at 15:30) https://youtu.be/C7fExZx1QyU",

There is this mindset amongst those on Reddit, that if there is housing for sale, people should just buy that housing. The reality....For the decades I've been following real estate data, potential home buyers will not purchase homes that do not fit their needs. If pending home sales have recently dropped, this could be a sign that the most desirable homes have already sold, leaving undesired housing. This could be a sign that the housing market is actually strong as home sales for Fall were actually better than expected. A small example is where I live....homes left for sale are on busy streets... or have no garages...or are too expensive at $3.5 million. Desired homes sell in Spring, Summer and Fall, while leaving junk for Winter.",

The clip at 5:57 is also clearly copied from one of Spanish streamer Kostyxd's old Omegle streams on YouTube. Kostyxd added Spanish subtitles to all of his English streams since his viewers were mostly from Spain at the time. Why else would this fake influencer randomly add Spanish subtitles to a conversation he's clearly having in English, and only for this one clip out of all the clips he posted in that video?

We see this recently with Cursor able to get many GPT-5.2 agents to build a browser within a week. And now with Anthropic utilizing multi-turn conversations to squeeze out gains. The methodology is different from METR of having the agent run once.

With AI models getting better and better every 3 to 7 months, and hardware improving every year, will we be able to just \"vibecode\" our own Photoshop on demand? The new SaaS will kinda be the AIs token usages. Like, I played a table game with friends, but it was kinda expensive for me to acquire, so I just spun up Antigravity with Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 and completely vibecoded the complete game in half a day with a local connection so everyone could play on their phone browser and a nice virtual board and controls and rules enforcements (wich could be turned off for more dynamic play) while the PC served as a local host. What do you guys think about this? SaaS = Software as a service.

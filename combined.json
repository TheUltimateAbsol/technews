        "score": 65,
        "text_content": "**(To Mod/Disclaimer)** Everything written here is reporting and selective analysis of patent filings. The implications are hypothetical not finalized so please don't take any of it as fact. No one knows how many of these patent filings will end up in RDNA 5/UDNA or later architectures. But as with my previous post looking through patent filings can reveal the priorities of AMD R&D and signal possible shifts ahead. After all lots of them do end up in finalized silicon and shipping products. This isn't an exhaustive indication of the possible changes that lie ahead so as we near EoY 2025 and enter 2026 more filings are certain to surface leading up to the launch of AMD's nextgen GPU architecture. This post was made in response to the patent filings shared by u/Kepler_L2 in the NeoGAF forums a yesterday and complete lack of proper coverage of the patents by the tech media. I am no expert so take everything with a grain of salt and be critical. I you find any mistakes please let me know. # Dense Geometry Format (DGF) Kepler\\_L2 called this basically HW level nanite, but IDK how accurate that description is. This is the [AMD patent filing for DGF](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250131639-dense-geometry-format.html), that they announced in February [via GPUOpen](https://gpuopen.com/learn/problem_increasing_triangle_density/). The Dense Geometry Format is all about making the BVH footprint as small as possible while reducing redundant memory transactions as per the blog: *\"DGF is engineered to meet the needs of hardware by packing as many triangles as possible into a cache aligned structure. This enables a triangle to be retrieved using one memory transaction, which is an essential property for ray tracing, and also highly desirable for rasterization.\"* It'll be supported in hardware by future AMD GPU architectures. RDNA 4 hasn't mentioned support so this is reserved for nextgen. [Another patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250131640-intersection-testing-dense-geometry-data-triangle.html) adresses RT issues with BW use by adding a low precision prefiltering stage where bulk processing of primitive packets are done by default for prefiltering nodes (an alternative route to DGF) and only for inconclusive results are full precision intersection tests required. Both DGF and Prefilter nodes have major benefits in terms of lowering the area required (low precision), eliminating redundant duplicative data, reducing node data fetching, and increase compute-to-memory ratio of ray tracing. Here is the full quote from the paper: *\"In the implementations described herein, parallel rejection testing of large groups of triangles enables a ray tracing circuitry to perform many ray-triangle intersections without fetching additional node data (since the data can be simply decoded from the DGF node, without the need of duplicating data at multiple memory locations). This improves the compute-to-bandwidth ratio of ray traversal and provides a corresponding speedup. These methods further reduce the area required for bulk ray-triangle intersection by using cheap low-precision pipelines to filter data ahead of the more expensive full-precision pipeline.\"* In conclusion the prefilter and DGF nodes allow a massively reduced load on the memory subsystem while permitting fast low precision bulk processing of triangles resulting in a speedup. All this while having an even lower area cost. # Multiple Ray Tracing Patents Filings I won't repeat all the patents from the previous post I made months ago so this is only the patent filings shared by Kepler\\_L2. [One about](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250182377-configurable-rayedge-testing-convex-polygon-groups.html) configurable convex polygon ray/edge testing which allows sharing of results from edges between polygons eliminating duplicative intersection tests. This has the following benefit: *\"By efficiently sharing edge test results among polygons with shared edges, inside/outside testing for groups of polygons can be made more efficient.\"* It can be implemented via full or reduced precision and makes ray tracing more cost-effective. Three other patent filings leverage displaced micro-meshes (DMMs) and a accelerator unit (AU) that creates them. [The first patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250200890-prism-volumes-displaced-subdivided-triangles.html) introduces prism volumes for displaced subdivided triangles (inferred from DMM). AU creates an bounding volume around DMM mesh, it then adds more bounding volumes thereby creating a prism (3D triangle) shape around the base triangle corresponding to the three corners and the low and high of interpolated DMM normals. The AUs then *\"...determine whether a ray intersects the prism volume bounding the first base triangle of the DMM\"* [The second patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250200865-ray-tracing-displaced-micro-meshes-bounding-prism-hierarchy.html) concerns ray tracing of DMMs using a bounding prism hierarchy. A base mesh is used which can be broken down into micro-meshes which can be adjusted with displacement to accurately showcase the scene detail. Method for intersection described same as in the other filings, except this one also mentions prisms at the sub base triangle level together making one big prism in accordance with first filing. [The third](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250218104-systems-methods-detecting-ray-intersections-displaced.html) talks about the specific method for detecting ray intersections with DMMs. This method is as follows: *\"Instead of detecting intersection with the bilinear patches directly, tetrahedrons that circumscribe the bilinear patches can be used instead. The two bases and the three tetrahedra make fourteen triangles. The device tests for potential intersection with the displaced micro-mesh by testing for an intersection with any of the fourteen triangles. Various other methods and systems are also disclosed.\"* I cannot figure out how this DMM implementation differs from NVIDIA's now deprecated DMM implementation in Ada Lovelace, but it sounds very similar although some differences are probably to be expected. IDK what benefits are to be expected here except perhaps lower BVH build cost and size. # Streaming Wave Coalescer (SWC) [The Streaming Wave Coalescer ](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250068429-streaming-wave-coalescer-circuit.html)implements thread coherency sorting similar to Intel's TSU and NVIDIA's SER implementations. It does this by using sorting bins and hard keys to sort divergent threads across waves following the same instruction path, thereby coalescing the threads into new waves. The [spill-after programming model](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250130811-spill-after-programming-model-streaming-wave-coalescer.html) offers developers granular control over when and how thread state is spilled to memory when reordering executions to different lanes. This helps avoid excessive cache usage and memory access operations resulting in large increases in latency and costly front-end stalls when leveraging SWC. Just like SER the SWC would help boost path tracing performance, although the implementation looks different and enabled by default. # Local Launchers and Work Graph Scheduler [One patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250217195-local-launch-workgroup-processors.html) mentions that each Workgroup Processer (WGP) can now use local launchers generate work/start shader threads independent of the Shader Program Interface (SPI). They maintain their own queues and ressource management but ask for help via SPI and lease ressources for each shader thread. Scheduling and dispatching work locally results in reduced latency, more dynamic work launches and reduced GPU frontend bottlenecks. [This patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20240111574-work-graph-scheduler-implementation.html) introduces a hierarchical scheduler made out of a global scheduler and one or more local schedulers called Work Graph Schedulers (WGS) located within each Shader Engine. Tasks are stored in a global mailbox/shared cache fed by the global scheduler and when a task (work item) is ready it then notifies one WGS to fetch it. Meanwhile scheduling and management of the work queue is offloaded to the local WGS. Each WGS independently schedules and maintains its own work queue for the WGPs and has its own private local cache. This resulting in quicker accesses and lower latency scheduling while at the same time enabling much better core scaling especially in larger designs as explained here: *\"In an implementation, the WGS* ***306*** *is configured to directly access the local cache* ***310***\\*, thereby avoiding the need to communicate through higher levels of the scheduling hierarchy. In this manner, scheduling latencies are reduced and a finer grained scheduling can be achieved. That is, WGS\\* ***306*** *can schedule work items faster to the one or more WGP* ***308*** *and on a more local basis. Further, the structure of the shader engine* ***304*** *is such that a single WGS* ***306*** *is available per shader* ***304***\\*, thereby making the shader engine\\* ***304*** *more easily scalable. For example, because each of the shader engines* ***304*** *is configured to perform local scheduling, additional shader engines can readily be added to the processor.\"* En essence each SE becomes its own pseudo-autonomous GPU that handles scheduling and work queue independently of the global scheduler. Instead of the orchestrating everything and micromanaging, the global scheduler can simply provide work via the global mailbox thereby offloading scheduling of that work to each Shader Engine. The patent filing also mentions that WGS may communicate with each other and that WGPs can assist in scheduling. The implementation is such that the WGS schedules work and sends a work schedule to the Asynchronous Dispatch Controller (one per Shader Engine). The ADC builds waves and launches work for the WGPs in the Shader Engines. When a WGS is underutilized it can communicate that to the global scheduler and request more work. When it's being overloaded work items are exported to an external global cache. This helps with load balancing and keeping Shader Engines fed. It's possible that a local scheduler might become overburdened, but AMD has another [patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250068464-hierarchical-work-scheduling.html) adressing this by allowing each WGS to offload work items to the global scheduler if they overwhelm its scheduling capabilities. These are redistributed to one or more other WGS residing within different scheduling domains/Shader Engines. # A Few Important Patents Filings The [RECONFIGURABLE VIRTUAL GRAPHICS AND COMPUTE PROCESSOR PIPELINE](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250131640-intersection-testing-dense-geometry-data-triangle.html) patent filing allows shaders (general purpose) to emulate fixed function HW and take over when a fixed function bottleneck is happening. Another patent filing talking about [ACCELERATED DRAW INDIRECT FETCHING](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20240192994-accelerated-draw-indirect-fetching.html) leverages fixed function hardware (Accelerator) to speed up indiret fetching resulting in a lowered computational latency and allows *\"...different types of aligned or unaligned data structures are usable with equivalent or nearly equivalent performance.\"*",

                "raw_content": "> The Streaming Wave Coalescer implements comprehensive out-of-order execution (RDNA 4 only has OoO memory requests). It does this by using sorting bins and hard keys to sort divergent threads across waves following the same instruction path, thereby coalescing the threads into new waves. This isn't really \"out of order execution\" as you'd see in a CPU. GPUs already switch to other waves to avoid the pipeline stalling an in-order CPU working on a single thread sees. This patent is more about divergence within a wave - if there's a conditional (like an \"if\" block) in a shader and the entire wave (32/64 threads depending on mode) doesn't end up taking *exactly* the same path, all paths need to be executed and the results simply ignored on the paths it \"shouldn't\" have run in. The same with loops - the entire wave takes as long as the largest iteration count of any single shader. So in cases where you're traversing through data structures that might have significant, unpredictable divergence at runtime (such as, for example, ray tracing BVH nodes) you can end up paying a *lot* for the long tail of shaders that happen to need a large number of node iterations, as they pin the entire wave they are are submitted with onto the GPU, even if much of the time they're executing is on things that will simply be ignored and wasted. Now this would be OK if you could, say, collect all the \"long running\" shader instances together into the same wave, so the \"quick\" instances can be completed without the longer running examples slowing it down. *That* seems to be what the particular patent is about, not really \"out of order\" execution. Similar to Nvidia's SER at a high level, but likely with implementation specifics differing and pos (RDNA4 already has some level of ability to resort and reorder shaders, but it's limited and requires a fair bit of \"software\" handholding, it looks to me like this patent is bringing more of the logic into hardware, presumably to make it more flexible and less costly) And I'm not sure calling DGF \"Hardware Nanite\" really makes sense - it's \"simply\" a more compact geometry representation, \"nanite\" is more about geometry virtualisation - so while GDF *could* be used in this path, it seems more like it's just side effect of \"Smaller geometry formats mean lower memory use, less bandwidth, and takes less cache space\" rather than anything directly related to virtualisation. It'll also benefit any other geometry users, as less memory use is always good.",

These look like the types of changes that might roll out over the course of a few generations before being all checked off, but massive scheduling and RT overhauls are pretty much what I expect for a supposedly brand-new architecture like UDNA. The distributed scheduling thing is very interesting in the context of a potential chiplet GPU. They call out lower latency and the ability to pass things up to a higher scheduler. That strikes me as maybe each chiplet having it's own scheduler, and a master center die hosting maybe I/O, memory controllers, and global scheduling.",

It plans to strengthen partnerships with local research institutes and precision equipment firms to establish a self-reliant domestic supply chain for advanced chipmaking tools. > The shipment of the PL-SR marks the first commercial deployment of a China-developed step-and-repeat NIL system. Industry insiders see it as a significant shift from lab prototype to practical manufacturing tool. > Founded in 2017, Pulin has focused on core R&D and holds over 50 invention patents. Its NIL platform spans equipment, materials, and processing, placing it among the few globally with end-to-end capabilities in this space. > Over 300 Chinese players engaged in advanced lithography R&D China's progress in lithography was on display at the 2025 Advanced Lithography Technology Symposium in Suzhou, which drew participation from more than 300 domestic research institutes and companies. The event focused on next-gen lithography processes, equipment R&D, and materials innovation, reflecting China's broader push for self-sufficiency in chipmaking. > Key academic participants included Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Fudan University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Domestic equipment makers like AMIES Technology and Hefei Haoyu Xinguang Technology presented progress in EUV laser components, multi-beam lithography, and packaging tools. > With global semiconductor supply chains growing more fragmented, China's push to build indigenous exposure and processing equipment could reshape the global competitive landscape. > Although China still trails global leaders like ASML and Canon in lithography, companies like Pulin are emerging as credible challengers with the potential to replace foreign tools in select applications.",

        "text_content": "So , I've been SUPER confused as to what you get with the switch 2 version of jamboree. I was under the impressions from reviews and other reddit posts , that , if you want to play the classic mario party boards , you had to play the switch 1 version of the game on the cartridge , with no graphic upgrades , which was a bummer , and if you wanted all the new tacked on stuff , then you had to go over to the jamboree TV side and play those with the 1440p upgrades. I almost just bought a used copy of jamboree for switch 1 but said screw it , and just took the plunge and got the switch 2 version. To my surprise , you can totally play all of the original Mario party jamboree boards just like you would on the switch 1 version but through the TV side, and you DO get the 1440p graphics upgrade that way . The only difference is , you cant earn the boards yourself , everything is just already unlocked. which..... fine . lol So it almost begs to question.... why even keep the old switch 1 game attached to it ? It just made things super confusing and it really doesn't serve much of purpose, unless you really like the flight school or something . Anyway, i didn't know this , most of you probably did , but for those that don't , YES you can play full Mario party jamboree boards in 1440p if you buy the switch 2 version of the game . Its just weird how you have to do it . Mainly just archiving this for googles search people to run across in the future. Because Nintendo made this as confusing as humanly possible.",

Yes i prefer full physical games any day over game key cards or eshop only downloads. But Game Key Cards are way better then code in a box/eshop only stuff. Its basically a ps4/ps5 disk with the difference you need a internet connection to download it once. Thats it. The Key card can still be given to a friend or sold and they can still use it since its tied to the card not to a Nintendo account. Don't get me wrong i prefer if 3rd Partys release their games in full on card (like cyberpunk 2077) but until there are more Storage sizes available (which are supposedly being worked on) i vastly prefer a game key card release over a code in a box or eshop only releases. Maybe they should have reused the old switch 1 cards and used them as a install card or something like that so that it doesn't need internet. In short Physical>Game Key Cards>eshop only>Code in a box",

                "raw_content": "On the surface, the housing market looks inhospitable for both buyers and sellers. But under the hood, economists are closely watching the data for signs of a shift. Shifting to what, exactly, is unclear: if certain movements are more than a blip, that could foreshadow a housing correction in the form of lower prices as buyers continue to balk, while other changes could usher in a sales pickup. \u201cThere are a few things that we have seen that have been kind of out of whack lately,\u201d says Joel Berner, a senior economist at Realtor.com. Here are three housing data points to follow closely in the coming months: Days on the Market It wasn\u2019t long ago that houses couldn\u2019t stay on the market long enough to be counted accurately in monthly data collection. Now, they\u2019re sitting for longer than before the pandemic, according to recent Realtor.com data. (Barron\u2019s and Realtor.com operator Move are both owned by News Corp). In July, homes spent a median 58 days on the market, Realtor.com\u2019s data show, the most for any July since 2017. It could be a blip, but the stat is \u201csomething we\u2019re keeping a really close eye on,\u201d says Berner. \u201cIf they get much slower than they were prepandemic, then we might be seeing something that looks like a\u2014not to use an ugly word\u2014but like a correction,\u201d he says. A correction may be an ugly word to sellers and homeowners\u2014but not buyers. Prospective buyers shopping for deals might find them in places where homes are sitting longer. About a fourth of the 100 largest metropolitan areas had their slowest July since at least 2016, Realtor.com data show, including Los Angeles, Dallas, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Seattle. But buyers can only benefit from lower prices if sellers keep their houses on the market. Delistings have recently gone up, Bermer notes. \u201cPeople who have the option are looking at the market and deciding, you know, now is not the right time for us,\u201d Berner says. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough demand in some of these markets to keep up with the number of listings that are on the market, and so people are deciding to delist,\u201d he says. Construction Data New homes represent just a sliver of the overall housing market\u2014but changes in data related to home building carries broader implications. Data show single-family home builders slammed on the brakes in recent months. In June, builders started construction on new homes at the slowest seasonally adjusted pace in about a year, Census data show. Authorizations to build new homes dropped to their slowest level since March 2023, foreshadowing a steeper slowdown to come. \u201cBuilders are extremely good at forecasting future housing demand,\u201d says Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist at Zillow. \u201cThey are increasingly wary of rising input costs in a falling price environment.\u201d It should concern buyers who planned to look to the new home market in search of lower mortgage rates or other perks. While the typical homeowner might be unwilling to shoulder costs to lower a buyer\u2019s mortgage rate or upgrade their countertops, builders often do to keep homes selling, even at the expense of their margins. In July, 62% of builders responding to an industry survey said they offered some sort of sales incentive, the National Association of Home Builders said last month. A pullback in housing starts could be a sign that the days are numbered for widespread discounts on new homes. That could be a plus for investors, but presents more hurdles for buyers. \u201cThe recent builder pullback does not bode well for closing large persistent housing deficits,\u201d Divounguy said. Employment and Inflation Data President Donald Trump might not be happy with the latest jobs report. But it gave those shopping for a lower mortgage rate reason to celebrate. July\u2019s weaker than anticipated jobs report and prior months\u2019 revisions shocked markets\u2014and dragged down mortgage rates in the process. Mortgage rates tend to move with the 10-year Treasury yield, which dropped in the wake of the employment report. On Tuesday, the yield was at its lowest level since April 30. The decline looks to have shaved nearly 0.2 percentage point off mortgage rates, according to Mortgage News Daily readings. The website\u2019s survey was showing a 30 year fixed rate of 6.58% on Tuesday, down from 6.75% on Thursday. Because of the close connection between home financing costs and economic indicators, employment and inflation data bears watching from here. Signs of a strong economy and rising prices, such as hotter-than-expected inflation data or strong jobs numbers, could send mortgage rates back up. But weak readings, like last week\u2019s employment data, could drive them lower. It could take time\u2014and sustained declines\u2014to dramatically change demand. Mortgage applications during the week ended last Friday rose a seasonally adjusted 2% from the week prior. \u201cSmall movements have not unleashed the pent-up demand,\u201d notes Jessica Lautz, the National Association of Realtors\u2019 deputy chief economist. But \u201cif mortgage rates dropped, there would be a considerable increase in housing demand,\u201d she says.",

Also, buying an already overpriced house and putting money in it to flip it above what the neighborhood will actually support seems like a game people lost at before, this time the banks won\u2019t get their hands dirty. In my area, nobody will build anything because of the timeline.

            {
                "raw_content": "* The majority of America\u2019s most resilient housing markets are located in the Rust Belt and are seeing an increase in home sales and prices. * The fastest-cooling U.S. markets are concentrated in Sun Belt states, where soaring inventory is causing prices to fall in some places. The U.S. housing market has been losing steam due to high homebuying costs and economic uncertainty, but some areas\u2014particularly the Rust Belt\u2014 are proving more resilient than others. Milwaukee is holding up better than any other major U.S. housing market, with home sales up 12% year over year, prices up 8.2%, and the typical seller fetching more than their list price. It\u2019s followed by another Midwest hub: Chicago, which in addition to rising prices and sales is seeing a drop in inventory and an uptick in market speed\u2014also signs of a resilient market. Rounding out the top 10 list are Philadelphia, Minneapolis, New York, Cincinnati, Detroit, Newark, NJ, Pittsburgh, and Virginia Beach, VA. Rust Belt Housing Markets Are Holding Up Best This is according to a Redfin analysis that ranks U.S. metropolitan areas based on year-over-year changes in the following metrics as of June 2025: homes sold, median sale price per square foot, share of homes that went under contract within two weeks, average sale-to-original-list price ratio, median days on market and inventory. Redfin analyzed the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas and included in this analysis the 49 with sufficient data (Kansas City, MO is the metro excluded). Here are a few traits the metros holding up best have in common: * Location: Six of the 10 metros holding up best are in the Rust Belt, whereas the fastest-cooling metros\u2014which we focus on in the final section of this report\u2014are concentrated in the Sun Belt. The Rust Belt, a once-booming steel manufacturing region that grappled with decades of economic decline, is experiencing less out-migration than it has in recent years as the pandemic-era population shift to the South slows. * Affordability: Home prices are up 5.9% year over year on average across these 10 metros holding up best, compared with a nationwide gain of just 0.5%. Still, most of these metros have prices lower than the national median. Affordability often begets home-price growth because buyers are drawn to affordable places when housing costs are elevated. That said, affordability is relative; many locals have been priced out of Rust Belt markets and would no longer consider these places affordable. * Rising demand, relatively small gains in supply: Home sales are up 6.4% year over year on average in these 10 metros versus a nationwide gain of 3.8%. Inventory is up 7.3%, compared with a nationwide gain of 11.8%. While supply is rising, it\u2019s still historically low in many of these metros. Limited supply paired with solid demand can fuel homebuyer competition and buoy prices. In general, the housing markets holding up best are markets where sellers likely have the upper hand, while the markets cooling fastest are more likely to be buyer\u2019s markets where sellers may be open to negotiation. Milwaukee Homes Are Attracting Bidding Wars, Selling for Above the Asking Price \u201cIs our market white hot? No. But is it red hot? Yes,\u201d said W.J. Eulberg, a Redfin Premier real estate agent in Milwaukee. \u201cUnlike much of the country, Milwaukee is not a buyer\u2019s market. While homes no longer get 15 offers and sell for $80,000 over the asking price like they did during the pandemic, they still get snapped up quickly because we continue to face an inventory shortage.\u201d Eulberg recently had a listing in South Milwaukee that went live on a Thursday and got an offer within three hours. By Saturday, the seller had seven offers. The home ended up selling for about $50,000 over the $256,000 list price because it was fairly priced, in good shape and in a decent location, he said, adding that Milwaukee\u2019s proximity to Chicago is a selling point for many buyers. Milwaukee\u2019s inventory shortage is being driven by a variety of factors. Many homeowners are hesitant to put their houses on the market because they don\u2019t want to lose the ultra-low mortgage rate they scored during the pandemic\u2014a trend that rings true across the country. The Midwest (and Northeast) have also been building fewer homes than the South and West, which are now seeing home prices fall in some areas amid a pileup of inventory. There\u2019s not much room left to build in Milwaukee proper, Eulberg said, and many of the homes that have been built in the area recently aren\u2019t priced for the typical first-time buyer. Las Vegas Is the Fastest-Cooling U.S. Housing Market Las Vegas is cooling faster than any other major U.S. housing market, with home sales down 10.2% year over year and inventory up a whopping 44.8%\u2014the largest gain among the metros Redfin analyzed. Prices in the pandemic boomtown are unchanged from last year, but the typical home fetches roughly 4% less than its list price. It also takes 51 days to sell\u201415 days slower than last year. By comparison, the typical U.S. home takes 40 days to sell\u2014just six days slower than last year. \u201cBuyers have more inventory to choose from than they\u2019ve had in years, so they feel like they can take their time. Even when they find a home they really like, they often wait to find something better,\u201d said Cherra Bergman, a Redfin Premier real estate agent in Las Vegas. \u201cHouse hunters are cost-conscious because mortgage rates are high, so many are opting for new-construction homes since builders here are offering great incentives like mortgage-rate buydowns and money toward closing costs in order to offload inventory.\u201d Sacramento, CA is the second-fastest-cooling housing market, followed by Denver, Fort Lauderdale, FL, Orlando, FL, San Diego, Miami, Seattle, Washington, D.C. and Oakland, CA. Many of these metros are home to Sun Belt cities that exploded in popularity during the pandemic, and in turn experienced a surge in home prices and homebuilding. Now, these markets are slowing because the number of homes for sale is rising but there are fewer people who can afford to buy them. This narrative is especially strong in Florida, which is also grappling with increasing natural disasters and soaring insurance and HOA costs. Three of the 10 metros cooling fastest are in Florida, and three are in California, which faces an especially intense housing affordability crisis. Prices are now declining in a handful of the fastest cooling markets, down 4.6% year over year in Oakland, and down roughly 1%-2% in Denver, San Diego, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. In most of these metros, inventory is posting double-digit increases, which causes homes to sit on the market and empowers buyers to negotiate. On average, less than one-third (30.3%) of homes in the 10 metros cooling fastest sell within two weeks, compared with 38% nationwide.",

It\u2019s really simple economics. Supply won\u2019t turn on again until rents move up to make development economically feasible - high construction costs plus tariffs coupled with higher rates on debt and higher equity return hurdles will keep supply low until the numerator (rents) increases.",

                "raw_content": "The U.S. apartment market saw occupancy and rent growth continue to hold steady in July, motivated by falling supply and mounting demand. For the second consecutive month, U.S. apartment occupancy registered at 95.5%, according to July data from RealPage Market Analytics. That was down just a shade from the peak of 95.6% from April and May, and just a shade above the market\u2019s five-year average of 95.4%. Year-over-year, occupancy was up 140 basis points (bps). Effective asking rents were up 0.2% year-over-year across the U.S. While any rent growth at all after the historic supply wave the country just came through is impressive, this was the market\u2019s lowest annual price increase in 10 months. Thus, operators continue to preserve occupancy at the expense of pushing prices. Aiding in the ability to preserve occupancy, apartment demand keeps hitting new highs. The nation recorded record absorption of over 794,000 units in the year-ending 2nd quarter, topping the peaks from 2021 and 2022. While supply volumes remain robust in historic terms, they are declining rapidly. Over 535,000 units were completed across the U.S. in the year-ending 2nd quarter. While that volume easily stands above the nation\u2019s long-term average, it came in below the all-time high recorded just two quarters ago. Ongoing construction volumes have come down every quarter since peaking in early 2023 and, as of 2nd quarter, hit a decade low. At the same time, multifamily permitting has waned. Moving forward, this could help firm up occupancy and inspire the return of rent growth. The Northeast and Midwest remain the nation\u2019s occupancy leaders, with rates of 96.8% and 96.4%, respectively. The West region is holding tight at 95.5% alongside the nation overall, while the South \u2013 where supply volumes have been the most extreme \u2013 has the most vacancies, with occupancy at 94.8%. Markets with the Most Rent Growth Tech-heavy coastal markets like San Francisco, New York and San Jose were among the largest 50 apartment markets with the most rent growth, with prices climbing 3% to 7% in the year-ending July. Other markets with big rent growth in the past year include Chicago, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. Tourism Markets See Weakness Meanwhile, markets that saw the deepest rent cuts in the past year were those that depend on tourism, such as Orlando, Nashville and Las Vegas. Softness in tourism-dependent markets can be an early sign of economic weakness as consumers tighten discretionary spending on travel. Other markets that continue to see deep rent cuts are supply-heavy areas like Austin, Denver, Phoenix and San Antonio.

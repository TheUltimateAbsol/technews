He is a red pill factory.He\u2019s never shied away from controversial issues and he\u2019s so intelligent and good hearted he can cut through the leftist propaganda effortlessly, just like Charlie. Been saying this for years. Vance is the best politician behind Trump. A country boy. A red blooded American. A marine. A rags to riches American Dream story personified. Trump couldn\u2019t have made a better VP choice. Vance was loyal all throughout Trump\u2019s first admin. Never faltered when so many other people started betraying Trump in 2020 and 2021. Close friends with Donald Trump Jr. May was well be part of the Trump family. There\u2019s actually a possibility of Vance 2028 and 2032 being better than Trump\u2019s two administrations. Trump revolutionized politics, discredited the media, and broke the Overton Window but Vance does some things better than Trump. Vance isn\u2019t as funny or compelling when he speaks but he is sharp as a tack, extremely polite, and he can appeal to moderates and independents in a way that Trump never could.

There was a man who chose faith over fear. There was a child born not into power or comfort, but into humility. No palaces, no armies, just obedience, trust, and love.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s the miracle we\u2019re about to witness once again this season.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to feel disheartened right now. The world seems loud, fractured, and unstable. Trolls and stormfags abound, and truth is often mocked. Faith is treated like a relic, conviction is labeled cruelty, and humility is mistaken for weakness. However, Christmas reminds us that God accomplishes His greatest work in unexpected places, through ordinary individuals, in moments that may appear insignificant at the time.</p> <p>Christ didn\u2019t come to validate the world as it was. He came to redeem it.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t arrive with force but through sacrifice. He didn\u2019t seek to rule through fear but to save through love. This doesn\u2019t mean truth became weaker; it means it became flesh\u2014lived, walked out among us.</p> <p>This season calls us back to that example.</p> <p>We must stand firm without becoming cruel. We must speak truth without losing compassion. We must hold our ground while remembering the significance of that ground.</p> <p>Christmas is not about escaping hardship; it\u2019s about God joining us in it.</p> <p>So, if things feel broken, weary, or confusing, you\u2019re closer to the manger than you realize.</p> <p>Take time this season to be still, pray, read the story again, spend time with your family, extend grace wherever possible, and remember that light shines brightest in the darkness not because the darkness is powerful, but because it cannot overpower the light.</p> <p>\u201cGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\u201d</p> <p>May that peace rest on your homes, your hearts, and your faith this Christmas.</p> <p>I apologize for my preaching tone, but I genuinely wish you all a very Merry Christmas.</p> <p>Merry Christmas</p>",

Sun et al. explored the strain dynamics in lithium-ion battery cathodes and **identified substantial heterogeneity in the states of charge among electrode particles at the onset of operation**, which induces local strain. Using optical flow mapping and grain-resolved synchrotron x-ray diffraction, the authors tracked particle behavior and revealed an intriguing coupling between charge transfer and particle motion.

All the while you're treated to an audiovisual spectacle, truly some of the best pixel art I've ever seen. Computer background material. I adored the game when it first dropped on PC and I am honestly glad for Switch/Switch 2 owners that they get a console exclusive (for now) like this. It's like someone realized we all get a kick out of the fishing minigame from every open world game ever, and made a game like that. It's not a grand adventure, it's trying to scratch the fishing minigame itch and absolutely succeeding. going for the vibes and they are immaculate. Fishing mechanics are really solid, which separates this game from your average indie pixel art game. it's just cast n chill. If you cough up a few extra pesos you can also get a cute pixel doggie and a kitty for your boat as a deluxe bonus, purely aesthetic and absolutely works. It won't be anyone's favorite game of all time, but a great small game to keep installed for a quick run maybe forever",

        "score": 53,
        "text_content": "It has been a significant amount of time since the widespread instability controversy surrounding the 13th and 14th Gen processors peaked, yet the long-term verdict on the flagship i9-14900KS remains a polarizing topic that requires a brutally honest reassessment in late 2025. Following the deployment of Intel\u2019s critical microcode updates, specifically the 0x129 and the finalized 0x12B patches intended to address the root cause of the Vmin shift instability, the narrative has largely shifted from active crisis management to a quiet acceptance, but I am looking to cut through the noise to understand the actual technical reality of daily driving this silicon today. I am specifically asking current owners to detail whether their systems have truly achieved complete stability without compromising the advertised performance metrics, or if the \"fix\" has simply masked underlying degradation issues that are now manifesting as occasional decompression errors, shader compilation stutters, or unexplained application crashes under heavy load. It is crucial to distinguish between a processor that is genuinely stable at stock Intel parameters and one that is only functioning because it has been manually downclocked or power-limited to avoid the voltage spikes that previously killed these chips. I am not interested in speculative defenses of the architecture; I need concrete feedback from users who have pushed this chip for months post-patch to determine if the 14900KS is finally a reliable workstation component or if it remains a silicon lottery gamble where degradation is still a looming threat despite the software mitigations. If you have had to RMA your unit recently or are noticing that your voltage requirements are creeping up to maintain the same frequencies, that is the kind of data point that defines the true state of this platform right now.",

I'd exclude physical tasks there, even though it gets sometimes fuzzy. For example it has to be able to pick up a random new game on steam and play it about as good as a teenager. I can come up with a LOT more examples but that's not the point. A lot things right now are simply not possible or very difficult with LLM's. The issue with hallucinations are way more prominent if used in real world scenarios. The issue that the systems are easily and consistently trickable (even by a dedicated ten year old) show up everywhere. You can trick a 16 year old once who's working their first job at McDonalds. Maybe twice. But if you put in an LLM and someone finds an exploit (which there are basically infinite of) you can consistently use this exploit. Ten thousand times if you want to. Until this issue is fixed and the next is found. And someone has to actively look at it and fix it. That's exactly what happened in reality. We consistently underestimate the complexity of mundane every day tasks while overestimating intellectual work. I don't like this sentiment that the average human is \"so dumb\". We are not. The amount of information we need to have to learn new things is ridiculously low. The issues even popped up with AlphaGo already, as there are very simple strategies which breaks the Ai consistently. Every ten year old can beat AlphaGo with those \"hacks\". With AlphaStar it was even more clear. Thats why they quietly buried it. And most other architectures based on any form of neural nets suffer the same issue, including LLM's. They are consistently breakable. It all comes down to continues learning with very limited data (like maybe ten sentences and a video). Context is not learning. The weights have to be adjusted somehow. That's what the big names realized sooner or later. YanLecun, Hassabis, Sudskever and so on. Scaling is not enough anymore if you don't solve continuous learning. Maybe it's just another research step, maybe needs a lot more work. Who knows? And about the tests? No idea how to test the gigantic real world application space you can teach an average 16 year old. But I think if we get to it, it will be pretty obvious that it's actually intelligent. The question is only asked if it's not obviously fluidly intelligent.",

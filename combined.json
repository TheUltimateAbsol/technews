There is massive amount of products on the market that use BOE displays. For products using off-the-shelf displays (for example many laptops), there might not be enough production from competitor displaymakers to get replacement display stock from, as these makers might need time to ramp up production. Then some products use a tailor-made display ordered from BOE. Getting replacement display stock from competitor displaymakers for these kind of displays will be really slow.",

Their current line of CPLDs is 15 years old. In that time they've not bothered even doing a die shrink of existing designs. It's a shame. Their Quartus development tools are relatively good (or less terrible) compared to the competition and I love the simplicity of the single-rail Max 10 parts; hook up 3.3v power and JTAG and you're in business.

The more friends you want to play with the worse it is as you need free slots and leads to desync issues where some always need to wait for others. Knockout tour is a good example. It is straight up impossible to play it with even just one friend because the mode requires simultaneous start from everyone and it is impossible to sync multiplex people that way. Splatoon 2 shows even more glaring flaws. It is a team VS team game and without the pregame lobby holding people together I'm randomly playing with or against my friends, making teamwork pretty much impossible.

        "score": 474,
        "text_content": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-08-13/americans-are-getting-priced-out-of-homeownership-at-record-rates For six glorious years, Paul Woods and Nora Stout owned a home in the Los Angeles suburb of Altadena. They grew lemons and oranges and hosted rollicking parties around a backyard pool facing the purple San Gabriel Mountains. After years of renting, the couple had realized their dream of homeownership and, they thought, were on track for long-term financial security. You can probably guess where this is going: up in flames. After the house was destroyed in LA\u2019s catastrophic January wildfires, Woods and Stout sold their burned-out lot for $540,000, 20% less than they paid for the house in 2018 and about half of the home\u2019s peak value right before the fire. They ruled out rebuilding, which would cost too much and take too long in a place that won\u2019t ever be the same. So they\u2019re back to renting\u2014for now, in a one-bedroom apartment in Orange County, 40 miles from Altadena. These days, though, it doesn\u2019t take a fire\u2014or even living in a famously in-demand coastal city\u2014for the math of homeownership not to add up. Across the US, the costs of purchasing a home are compounding from a lack of new construction since the 2008 financial crisis, the lock-in effect of homeowners unwilling to relinquish low-rate mortgages, plus government policies that make buying and building more expensive. Combine that with mounting losses from climate-change-fueled disasters and other burdens of ownership, and more residents are finding themselves on the losing end of what was for years a solid bet on economic stability and wealth creation. As home sales fall to near-record lows, one of the cornerstones of the American dream is crumbling\u2014and there\u2019s no clear plan for fixing it. It\u2019s no surprise that home purchasing costs have soared, with mortgage rates hovering near two-decade highs and property prices breaking records. What\u2019s shocking is how quickly prices have ballooned out of reach. The annual income needed to afford monthly payments on a median-priced home in the US was $126,670 in 2024\u2014a 60% jump from $79,330 in 2021, according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Meanwhile the US median household income was $80,610 in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available, up just 1.3% from three years earlier. \u201cThere\u2019s no rush to be a homeowner given that differential,\u201d says Laurie Goodman, founder of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute. For decades part of the logic for buying a house was that, after the down payment, mortgage payments were generally cheaper than renting. Ultrapricey cities such as New York and San Francisco were the exception. Well, no more: As of June, renting was on average $908 a month cheaper than buying a starter home, and the cost of owning was higher in 49 of the 50 largest US metro areas, according to Realtor.com. Pittsburgh is the last major city where owning is cheaper than renting. In 2021, when mortgage rates were at rock bottom, buying was still as cheap or cheaper than renting in 21 markets, including Atlanta, Cleveland, Philadelphia and Tampa, Florida. The costs associated with homeownership are all spiraling upward, particularly as climate change exacts its toll. The average insurance bill has jumped 74% across the US since 2010, thanks to the growing prevalence of floods, wildfires and other disasters, according to Cotality, a real estate data service. From 1980 to 2024, Texas\u2014one of the country\u2019s hottest housing markets, with vast stores of land and few rules around development\u2014has led the country in annual disasters exceeding $1 billion in damage. It had 20 such events in 2024, up from five in 2014. That was before July\u2019s flash floods killed at least 135 people in an area with tens of thousands of buildings. As home prices soar, so do assessments; in Florida, for example, property tax bills rose almost 50% from 2019 through 2024, according to Cotality. Property taxes jumped 33% in Dallas and 32% in Clark County, Nevada\u2014home to Las Vegas\u2014over the same period. Building or buying a new house costs even more than purchasing an existing home, and President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are making the materials more expensive. Another cost pressure: Immigrant workers\u2014the majority of plasterers, drywall installers, roofers and painters\u2014are going into hiding as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids terrorize their communities. Homeownership has long been a prime symbol of having \u201cmade it\u201d in American society. The Founding Fathers saw it as a prerequisite for the right to vote. After World War II, tax benefits and appreciating values turned homes into a kind of passive savings account that owners could pass on to descendants. But in some ways the dream of the \u201cownership society,\u201d as George W. Bush said as president in calling for his vision of all Americans owning homes, is responsible for its own death. In the early 2000s, US homeownership reached a record high as lenders offered so-called Ninja loans, mortgages that required virtually no income, job or assets to obtain. By 2008 millions of families found themselves unable to pay or refinance, triggering the biggest wave of foreclosures since the Great Depression. Builders have held back on construction ever since. The US housing deficit grew to about 4.7 million units in 2023 as household formation outpaced new construction. That shortage is keeping home prices high even when demand goes soft. Low supply has juiced home equity for existing owners, but it\u2019s one more factor in shutting out others. What does it mean that the American dream is increasingly unavailable? For one thing, there are fewer chances for families to step onto the wealth ladder. The median net worth of a homeowner in the US is 43 times that of a renter, according to a 2025 estimate from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances. And though rents may be cheaper than owning in large swaths of the country, they\u2019re still damn high\u2014so high they\u2019re preventing would-be buyers from saving for a house that would then let them build equity. Other factors are also making it hard to conserve. \u201cStudent loan debt forgiveness going away and the increased cost of living\u2014there\u2019s less savings for a lot of reasons,\u201d says Joel Berner, a senior economist for Realtor.com. Younger generations, especially those who grew up in renter households, face some of the steepest barriers to entry. In 2024 the median age of first-time buyers climbed to 38, from 28 in 1991. Also last year, the share of first-time buyers in the housing market crashed to 24% from 32% in 2023, the lowest in records dating to 1981, according to the National Association of Realtors. About a quarter of first-time buyers rely on down-payment assistance from family or friends; these gifts or loans tend to be less available for people whose parents didn\u2019t own. In this era of uncertainty, perhaps ownership is no longer all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Some people may be better off without a mortgage that anchors them in one place and limits mobility. Not plunking down for a house lets people do things they might care more about; 83% of Generation Z renters say they\u2019d rather invest in experiences such as travel and career growth than save for a home, according to a survey by Entrata, a property management software provider. Buyers with a disproportionate share of their assets in a home are also the most vulnerable to volatility in the housing market. In fact, some experts are advising homeowners to cash in their equity and reduce their exposure. These days even older owners with smaller, low-interest mortgages should consider trading in for a rental, says Daryl Fairweather, an economist for Redfin. \u201cI think they overvalue staying in a home,\u201d she says. \u201cHomes are expensive.\u201d America as a society of renters might not be all bad",

Total mortgage application volume rose 10.9% from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased to 6.67% from 6.77%, with points increasing to 0.64 from 0.59, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate is 13 basis points higher than it was the same week one year ago. The average contract interest rate for 5/1 ARMs (adjustable-rate mortgages) decreased to 5.80% from 6.06%. ARM loans are generally fixed for a term but then adjust to market rates, making them riskier products. Applications to refinance a home loan jumped 23% for the week and were 8% higher than the same week one year ago. That was the strongest week for refinancing since last April. The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 46.5% of total applications from 41.5% the previous week. \u201cAs seen in other recent refinance bursts, the average loan size grew significantly to $366,400. Borrowers with larger loan sizes continue to be more sensitive to rate movements,\u201d said Joel Kan, an MBA economist in a release. \u201cGiven the relative attractiveness of ARM rates compared to fixed rate loans, ARM applications increased 25 percent to their highest level since 2022, and the ARM share of all applications was almost 10 percent.\u201d",

        "text_content": "For context, I went down this rabbit hole because I wanted to use PTM7950 instead of thermal paste for my laptop, and the overwhelming consensus on Reddit seemed to be that \"there are lots of fakes online\" and that \"I had to make sure I was getting the 0.25mm version since that's the only thickness PTM7950 is manufactured in.\" This might have been the case at some point, since there are old documents from Honeywell showing that they only manufacture PTM7950 at 0.25mm, but currently, [the spec sheet on their website ](https://advancedmaterials.honeywell.com/content/dam/advancedmaterials/en/documents/document-lists/electronic-materials/technical/hon-ess-ais-semiconductor-materials-application-note-tims.pdf)clearly states that they manufacture it at any thickness between 0.2mm and 0.5mm. The idea that 0.2mm PTM7950s are fake seems to come from the original [Framework Forum post](https://community.frame.work/t/honeywell-ptm7950-phase-change-thermal-pads-sheets-application-tips-and-results/20245), the [LTT video that references that post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BhKx0iQ4K8), and [the igor'sLAB test](https://www.igorslab.de/en/5-phasenwechsel-pads-im-test-honeywell-ptm7950-ptm7950sp-vs-pcm5000-pcm8500-und-thermalright-heilos/), but none of these sources actually show a fake 0.2mm PTM7950! [The original Framework forum post ](https://community.frame.work/t/honeywell-ptm7950-phase-change-thermal-pads-sheets-application-tips-and-results/20245)says they \"think\" 0.2mm from Aliexpress is fake because of those Honeywell documents that only show the 0.25mm version. But OP has actually edited the post saying their 0.2mm Aliexpress version actually performs the same, and that it's probably an original. I think [the LTT video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BhKx0iQ4K8)claims that their Aliexpress version is fake simply because they are repeating what's been said on the Framework forum post. But if Linus had stopped reading the script for a second and looked at his own charts, he would've realized that their \"fake\" 0.2mm Aliexpress one and the \"original\" eBuy7 0.25mm one perform just about the same on the GPU tests. Moreover, on their CPU tests, the \"fake\" 0.2mm performs about the same as liquid metal, while the \"original\" 0.25mm performs slightly better than liquid metal?? Considering they used power consumption as the metric and cut off the charts before they stabilized, I wouldn't really trust their CPU tests. Plus, they apply them to the CPU lid instead of the die. Finally, there is [the igor'sLAB's test](https://www.igorslab.de/en/5-phasenwechsel-pads-im-test-honeywell-ptm7950-ptm7950sp-vs-pcm5000-pcm8500-und-thermalright-heilos/). That one seems to be the most \"robust\" test, and it's clear that the original PTM7950 is much better according to his results. But, crucially, he is not comparing \"fake\" 0.2mm PTM7950s from Aliexpress against the original here. He compares PCM5000 and PCM8500 against PTM7950, claiming that the 0.2mm PTM7950s on Aliexpress are actually PCM5000 and PCM8500 since they are 0.2mm too. However, there is no proof of this claim at all in his test. The image of his PCM5000 clearly shows \"PCM5000\" on the label, so that one is not branded as \"PTM7950\". And while he doesn't give his source for the PCM8500, if he bought that as \"PTM7950\" from Aliexpress, how would he know that it's actually PCM8500? My guess is that he simply bought PCM5000 and PCM8500 from reputable sellers that were branded as what they are: PCM5000 and PCM8500. I'm not saying that any random purchase on Aliexpress or eBay will be an original PTM7950. But it seems like the abundance of fake PTM7950s is greatly exaggerated by these reviews and Reddit. If you are having difficulty finding a non-overpriced reputable seller, it might be worth giving a \"fake\" cheap PTM7950 a shot.",

        "text_content": "Replaying Forgotten land with 60 fps has been bliss. I\u2019ve always loved this game, and now one of the worst parts about it has been fixed. As I play it, I keep thinking about how well this game continues to deliver on its atmosphere and gameplay. Kirby, a pink puff of pure joy and whimsy, is such a contrast to the decrepit buildings and overgrown worlds that you explore in the game. It\u2019s so unusual, but that\u2019s what makes it good. The strangeness, the absurdity, that\u2019s what makes the Forgotten Land such a fun setting. It\u2019s like Kirby is a flashlight in the dark; he illuminates what otherwise is a gloomy world which would be quite sad to inhabit. The final boss is where this dichotomy reaches its peak. Kirby finds Elfilin and fights a decently fun but kinda standard boss fight against Leongar, the leader of the beast pack. You save Elfilin, and then the strange corrupt beast frees behind Leon itself and consumes everything in sight. Already, it\u2019s unusual. The collage of faces in a strange goo that chases Kirby down a hallway is such a cool moment, it feels like the metaphorical darkness is trying to suppress the flashlight. After the specimen consumes Elfilin and two halves have become whole again, the fight on the ceiling is truly spectacular. It\u2019s a pretty large difficulty jump from the rest of the game (though still easy, it\u2019s Kirby after all), and the stakes feel so insanely high. When you finally free Elfilin, Elfilis takes the little power he has left to doom both the Forgotten Land AND Planet Popstar, Kirby\u2019s home planet. At this point, the adrenaline is pumping. Though it\u2019s not hard to do anything the game requires you to do, it still manages to make this final encounter feel powerful and encourage you to try your best. Just when you think it can\u2019t get any crazier, a 18 wheeler gets thrown to Kirby. Yeah, you\u2019re going to kill a God by ramming into him with a truck. An incredible remix of the invincibility theme plays as you drive across floating buildings being pulled by Popstar\u2019s gravity. It ends in a final confrontation with Elfilis where you just have to mash a button. Normally, I dislike when a game just has you mash a button instead of having some kind of interesting mechanic. But here is different. Here is different because all I really wanna do is mash. I\u2019m putting all my energy into this one specific action, music blaring in the background encouraging me to do this one thing. And you do it. It\u2019s ridiculous, it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s strange, it\u2019s encouraging, it\u2019s\u2026 beautiful. I don\u2019t think any other finale in any other 3D platformer has felt so insane yet whimsical. As much as I love games like Odyssey and Bananza, especially their final moments, they don\u2019t have the same allure as Kirby. Such a good game.",

Following is a chart of the Fed funds rate since the 1950\u2019s. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/fedfunds As far back as the [1980\u2019s S&L crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis), housing corrections have lagged Fed funds rate hikes. As an example of this I have documented the 2008 housing bubble. * 07/2004 - The Fed begins hiking rates in July of 2004. * 12/2004 - There were no reports of a housing crisis in 2004. * 01/2005 - One of the very first people to recognize a problem was brewing in housing was Michael Burry and [he didn\u2019t begin to focus on it until 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry#Investment_career). At that time he predicted the bubble would collapse as early as 2007. * 01/2006 - The Fed continues to raise rates throughout 2005 and part of 2006. * 07/2006 - The Fed funds rate peaks in July of 2006. * 06/2007 - The first sign of a full blown crisis appears when [Bear Stearns bails out one of its own CDO funds.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns#Start_of_the_crisis_%E2%80%93_two_subprime_mortgage_funds_fail) * 08/2007 - The Fed holds rates steady until August of 2007 at which time they begin lowering rates. * 12/2007 - The Fed continues lowering rates throughout the remainder of 2007 and into 2008. * 01/2008 - The largest U.S. home loan provider, [Countrywide collapses and is forced to sell itself to Bank of America](https://archive.ph/0gaE6) for a fraction of what it was worth just months prior. * 03/2008 - [Bear Stearns collapses and is sold to JP Morgan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns#Fed_bailout_and_sale_to_JPMorgan_Chase) * 09/2008 - [Lehman Brothers collapses and files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers#Bankruptcy_filing) As can be seen, there was a lag of 3 years between the time the Fed began raising rates before the first sign of a collapse in the housing market. Even then the signs weren\u2019t obvious. No one outside of the most in-tune people working in the financial industry and privy to the most detailed information were aware of what was happening at Bear Stearns in mid 2007. The first sign us plebs saw, and most didn\u2019t recognize it, was much later in early 2008, 4 years from when the Fed began raising rates, when Countrywide and Bear Stearns were forced to sell themselves off to the highest bidders. The collapse wasn\u2019t evident to everyone until the Lehman collapse in September of 2008. That was plastered all over the news. So given the 2008 collapse we should anticipate a correction in housing to occur about 4 years after the Fed begins raising the Fed Funds rate. That\u2019s not a perfect metric, not all bubbles collapse in that time frame but it is a good rule of thumb, I believe. The Fed began raising rates in February of 2022. Given that, we should be expecting a real correction to occur sometime around Feb of 2026. Five months from now. In other words a correction is likely already well underway at this point but it isn\u2019t in our faces yet to the point where it is impossible to deny.",

There\u2019s a saying from somewhere (Ferriss, maybe?) that essentially says \u201cif you\u2019re not addicted to something, you just haven\u2019t found your molecule yet.\u201d We\u2019ve all got a molecule, and AI stands to serve up an infinite number of them. Sure it can be porn, but it can also be a music genre that stopped being popular decades ago that you love, Star Wars novels that pick up where you wished they would, bringing childhood pictures to life in immersive video\u2026 every single one of us probably has a thing that AI will be able to produce, and it\u2019ll be hard to turn away. There\u2019s an excellent argument to be made that our brutal conquering of boredom is a serious problem. I love AI, but I don\u2019t see how that problem doesn\u2019t get exponentially worse.",

I tried Suno 1 year ago and it sucked. Now I think it's already better than at least 50% of musicians already and I think it will be better than 99% of human music by the end of 2026. I used Gemini to create the prompt and style for Suno. I'm not a professional musician or anything btw so don't roast my prompt too hard haha. Here was the prompt to generate the lyrics: *\"You are Steve Jobs. Write a song about the most emotional, important, and interesting parts of your life. Your goal is to evoke emotion from the listener through hyper contrast hyper rhyming. Make the lyrics hyper rhymed hyper contrasting, especially the verses, with lots of intersentence rhyming. Make the lyrics hyper stylized with lots of singing flair like \"APAAAAAAAART\" for emphasis. Use the most intense variations of words such as Sterile instead of clean etc. Embed this hyper stylization throughout the lyrics. Every sentence should look like the following example in terms of style: \"****MY. OWN. \\[swear word\\] HERESY.*** *that left the* ***DEEPEST SCAAAAAAAAAR.*** *Start with the chorus. Make the chorus only 4 lines. 1st person\"\"* Style: Dark, cinematic hip hop, soulful sample beat meant to evoke emotion out of the listener, hyper dramatic singing. Confessional Singing. Emotional. Intense. Take inspiration from the most famous singers who sing in this style.",

They *where* still better then chance (my sample was very small, both in people and in songs), it was about 60/40, but with the speed this is going, it's basically a done deal this year. Try it out yourself. Grab random music in a genre and generate music with the latest model in the same genre. Go ahead and cherrypick, we are not saying *every* ai generated song will pass the Turing test yet. Make a small playlist. Randomly shuffle the music and let people listen and guess. Depending on your prompting technique your milage may very, but it's somewhat fun (and horrible) to see their faces sink when they realise how difficult of a task this is becoming. Also have tissues on hand. One of my relatives had a bit of a crisis as she was thinking of a young friend who is trying to become a musician.",

We present GEMORNA, a generative RNA model that utilizes Transformer architectures tailored for mRNA coding sequences (CDSs) and untranslated regions (UTRs), to design novel mRNAs with enhanced expression and stability. GEMORNA-designed full-length mRNAs exhibited up to a 41-fold increase in firefly luciferase expression compared to an optimized benchmark in vitro. GEMORNA-generated therapeutic mRNAs achieved up to a 15-fold enhancement in human erythropoietin (EPO) expression and substantially elicited antibody titers of COVID vaccine in mice. Additionally, GEMORNA\u2019s versatility extends to circular RNA, substantially enhancing circular EPO expression and boosting anti-tumor cytotoxicity in CAR-T cells.

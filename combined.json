I felt like I was being stupid and wasteful. Future proofing is stupid and there's no immediate utility for most of what I bought. I mean... surely in the future memory prices would go down as they generally do and this was just overkill. I was doing it solely because I was really busy and the thought of upgrading RAM was nagging at my mind... I wanted to focus on more important things. At today's prices, I would not upgrade. There's no way I'd buy 160GB of RAM. There's just no value in it. So anyway I have a bunch of DDR4 RAM now that I have lying around going unused...",

If you are really going to go all the way might as well get the actual full die and tons of vram. I would rather pay 8k for the Rtx pro and a waterblock then 5k for this. As soon as the 6090 comes out this will be worth like a few hundred more than a FE 5090 but an RTX pro will still probably be worth like 5 or 6 grand just because of the vram.",

No information on when this is going live, but the [Metal Gear Solid MC patch notes website](https://metalgear.konami.net/information/mc1/mgs2/ps5/en/index.html) has a 2.1.0 patch going live on February 13th, tomorrow (EST). Whether this is for Japan or North America is unclear, but I think it'll probably go live soon nonetheless. EDIT: Updates are now available! UPDATE: Confirmed that Metal Gear Solid 3 and 2 now run at 60FPS on Switch 2! They also have the same new resolution options that PS4 got in the November 2024 update! It can run at 1080p60 in FHD mode, or 720p60 in Original mode. While the game warns of a performance hit, I did not observe this in the Virtuous Mission segment of MGS3 and sincerely doubt it drops at all from running at 1080p60 on the Switch 2. MGS3 is way more demanding than MGS2 so don't worry about frame drops there. Unfortunately, the UHD (1440p) or 4K options available on other consoles are not available on Switch 2.",

The stream revealed new characters representing the *Unbreakable X-Men* team - In addition to Storm, **Wolverine**, **Magik** and **Danger** join the roster * For those who don't know, Danger was introduced in Joss Whedon and John Cassaday's *Astonishing X-Men* and is literally the Danger Room. After it was destroyed by Colossus under the influence of the Shadow King, Charles has the facility upgraded using technology from the alien Shi'ar race, but its newfound sentience was hidden as a secret from the rest of the team until it came to life, seeking revenge against Xavier for their seclusion. It tried to kill the X-Men for a whole arc where it trapped everyone inside the Mansion, it was kind of the start of the comics portraying Xavier in the more morally ambiguous light associated with his modern characterization. It later became a warden to the X-Brig, which was a high-security prison for some of the X-Men's enemies on Utopia, a chunk of San Francisco overseen by Cyclops as a mutant safe haven during his schism with Wolverine, and later a team member on X-Factor * A **single-player story mode** was teased called \"Episode Mode,\" with cutscenes mimicing motion-comics using illustrations from numerous artists and writing from an unannounced Marvel Comics collaborator * **Pre-order information** revealed: * **Standard edition** (physical release also available) * **Digital Deluxe edition** w/ Year One season pass (4 post-launch characters + one stage), Howard the Duck lobby avatar and Cosmo the Spacedog lobby pet * **Ultimate Edition** w/ Digital Deluxe bonuses, animated chromatic costume alt unlocks for the whole roster, and 5 additional character colors: * **Advanced Suit 2.0 Spider-Man** (the Insomniac suit) * **Punk Rock Storm** (that time she was a raging mohawk-sporting bisexual in the Claremont run) * **Classic Iron Man** (based on the original red-gold armor from the *Tales to Astonish* comics) * **Classic Captain America** (self-explanatory) * **Supreme Ruler Doctor Doom** (I think this might be game-original?

                "raw_content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. (February 12, 2026) \u2014 The delinquency rate for mortgage loans on one-to-four-unit residential properties increased to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.26 percent of all loans outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s (MBA) National Delinquency Survey. The delinquency rate was up 27 basis points from the third quarter of 2025 and up 28 basis points from one year ago. The percentage of loans on which foreclosure actions were started in the fourth quarter remained unchanged at 0.20 percent. \u201cMortgage delinquencies increased across all three major loan types \u2013 Conventional, FHA, and VA \u2013 in the last three months of the year,\u201d said Marina Walsh, CMB, MBA\u2019s Vice President of Industry Analysis. \u201cThe most pronounced uptick was with FHA loans, which reached a delinquency rate of 11.52 percent, the highest level since the second quarter of 2021. While earlier-stage FHA delinquencies remained relatively flat compared to the previous quarter, later-stage, 90+ day delinquencies increased by 76 basis points. The FHA foreclosure inventory rate also grew to the highest level since the first quarter of 2020.\u201d Added Walsh, \u201cThe fourth quarter results may have been impacted by the expiration of pandemic-era, FHA relief options as well as disparities in the labor market \u2013 a key determinant of mortgage delinquency levels.\u201d Walsh noted that serious delinquencies \u2013 which include loans 90+ days delinquent and in foreclosure \u2013 vary by year of origination. For FHA loans, the vintage years 2020 and 2021 are performing better than the vintage years 2022 and 2023, when mortgage rates rose and affordability was especially stretched. With FHA volume increasing, mortgage rates moderating, and borrower credit characteristics improving on newer FHA originations, the performance of recent cohorts may temper stress on overall FHA portfolios. - Compared to last quarter, the seasonally adjusted mortgage delinquency rate increased for all loans outstanding. By stage, the 30-day delinquency rate decreased 5 basis points to 2.07 percent, the 60-day delinquency rate increased 16 basis points to 0.92 percent, and the 90-day delinquency bucket increased 16 basis points to 1.27 percent. - By loan type, the total seasonally adjusted delinquency rate for conventional loans increased 27 basis points to 2.89 percent over the previous quarter. The total FHA seasonally adjusted delinquency rate increased 74 basis points to 11.52 percent, and the total VA seasonally adjusted delinquency rate increased 10 basis points to 4.60 percent. - On a year-over-year basis, total mortgage delinquencies increased for all loans outstanding. The delinquency rate increased 27 basis points for conventional loans, increased 49 basis points for FHA loans and decreased 10 basis points for VA loans from the previous year. - The delinquency rate includes loans that are at least one payment past due but does not include loans in the process of foreclosure. The percentage of loans in the foreclosure process at the end of the fourth quarter was 0.53 percent, up 3 basis points from the third quarter of 2025 and 8 basis points higher than one year ago. - The non-seasonally adjusted seriously delinquent rate, the percentage of loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure, was 1.85 percent. It increased 24 basis points from last quarter and increased 17 basis points from last year. The seriously delinquent rate increased 9 basis points for conventional loans, increased 106 basis points for FHA loans, and increased 28 basis points for VA loans from the previous quarter. Compared to a year ago, the seriously delinquent rate remained unchanged for conventional loans, increased 104 basis points for FHA loans and remained unchanged for VA loans. - The five states with the largest quarterly increases in their overall delinquency rate were: Mississippi (109 basis points), Louisiana (89 basis points), Maryland (87 basis points), Oklahoma (86 basis points), and Indiana (86 basis points).

Products, policies, and other choices affecting millions of people are too often entrusted to intuition, experience, and luck. What if we all had the capability to simulate the results of our decisions, to preview the effect before triggering the cause? At Simile, we have built the first AI simulation of society, populated by agents based on real humans. Our research pioneered the field of AI-based simulation, creating generative agents to prove that it is possible to simulate real people with high accuracy. We are now developing a foundation model that predicts human behavior in any situation, at any scale. In response to market demand, we combined research with application. Today, leading companies use Simile to rehearse earnings calls, model litigation outcomes, and test policy changes. Soon, we envision simulating entire worlds: trillions of interacting decisions across individuals, organizations, cultures, and states. We are backed by $100M in funding led by Index Ventures, with participation from Hanabi, A*, Bain Capital Ventures, Andrej Karpathy, Fei\u2011Fei Li, Adam D\u2019Angelo, Guillermo Rauch, Scott Belsky, and others.

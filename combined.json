He is comparing the X2E 88 (18C, nearly highest X2E clocks) vs the X1E 78 (12C, slowest X1E SKU, **no Turbo**). I do not know why this problem affects many laptop reviewers. Desktop reviews usually get it. Nobody would test a **9900X** (12C, nearly highest 1T clocks) vs a **7600X** (6C, slowest 1T clocks) and then claim (3:45): \"*Let's be honest, this kind of performance uplift in a single generation is huge*.\" Mate, you are not comparing a single generation leap. We also jumped like 5+ CPUs up in the product stack. The appropriate comparison does (or rather will) exist: the X2E 78 exists, another 12C, low-tier SKU. We saw the same with the X9 388H (PTL) being compared to then mid-tier CPUs. // Laptop reviewers seem notorious for no clocks / cores on each CPU in the charts: it'd be beneficial, with the alphabet soup AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm use, for more clarity what SKU is what. On desktop, we can match by price. ***If*** the X2E 88 *is* found in all the cheaper laptops that housed the X1E 78, it makes more sense. But until then, just match the SKUs or provide that context for users. // Also, it seems like this has slower perf / GHz 1T on CB2024? Some quick maths: X1E 78 (108 pts / 3.4 GHz): 31.8 Pts / GHz X2E 88 (146 pts / 4.7 GHz): 31.0 Pts / GHz I would for more optimizations, but ASUS specifically said the Cinebench numbers were in line, so it is weird. However, it *may* be like Geekerwan's 8EG5 results, where the CPU actually notably throttles at 1T boost, so it can't hold the 4.7 GHz clock (thus dividing by 4.7 GHz is not accurate).",

If there were still a u/TwelveSilverSwords around, I'd like to see an analysis on ppa of these cores. Top of my head I don't know the sizes of PTL's compute tile and X2E's die. As for GPU, this is interesting. Just a few samples, but it's no slouch (not like before with X1).

We don't have a die shot of the X2 Elite, but based on the 8 Elite Gen 5, we can estimate the GPU area to be under 30 mm2, which is almost half the size of Arc B390 and surely smaller than M5 too. Imagine if they put 50% more cores (3072 ALUs), while dialing the clock speed back a bit. They have the bandwidth to feed it, thanks to the 192 bit memory bus.

The feel is completely different. First off, it\u2019s lighter and the build quality just screams premium. It also feels slightly smaller than the original.

I'm ideally looking for games with no downsides (other than maybe load times) when compared to a PS5 (my other owned platform). So for example, while I'm sure it is a technological marvel, from what I've seen I'd still rather play Cyberpunk on the PS5 over the Switch 2. But MIO memories in orbit on the other hand seems like a perfect port and it gets the benefit of portability. Ofc I'm ok with the game not running as well (it'd be a stupid comparison) or losing a bit here and there, but I'm mostly looking for 60fps games that look great. Indies are very welcome!",

This method **utilizes** rolling contact joints, curved surfaces that both roll and slide against each other to achieve fluid, natural motion. **Key Breakthroughs:** **99% Reduction in Misalignment:** Unlike traditional single-axis hinge joints, this design follows the real spatial motion of a human knee. In tests, it corrected painful joint misalignment by 99% compared to standard mechanisms. **Mechanical Intelligence:** The approach offloads motion control from software to the physical geometry of the joint. By optimizing the shape of rolling surfaces for specific tasks, the joint itself directs energy where it is needed. **Increased Efficiency:** Because the mechanics handle more of the work, robots can use smaller actuators and consume less power. **Enhanced Performance:** A prototype robotic gripper designed with this method held three times more weight than conventional designs using the same motor input.",

Five leading public AI companies are collectively on track to spend about **$700B** this year on large-scale projects, primarily data centers filled with powerful computer chips. This level of spending is **nearly double** what they spent in 2025 and is comparable to roughly three-quarters of the annual U.S. military budget. This type of investment is contributing to shortages of skilled labor such as electricians, rising construction costs & tighter supplies of computer chips. **Industry analysts** said this has already pushed up prices for memory chips used in smartphones and computers, with higher consumer electronics prices expected to follow. The data center construction boom is also drawing workers and resources away from other types of building projects, while smaller technology firms face declining **access** to funding as investment becomes increasingly concentrated among a small number of large AI companies. **Source:** The Washington Post (Exclusive)",

But no one should believe it's \"free\" performance\u2014and why should it be? Clocks went up significantly, only a minor node improvement, and limited IPC gains. If you want faster perf with those limitations \u2192 just rip the clocks & eat more power. // Of course, compared to Intel & AMD, Apple remains multiple *generations* ahead in perf + perf / W on 1T and perf-per-core and perf / W on nT. M5 is a smaller design (4P+6E), so it can't compete with the 12-core, 14-core, etc. CPUs, especially at its 27.5W average load. Qualcomm does quite well (expected from their Apple \u2192 NUVIA pedigree). As some were confused: Cinebench is ***one*** test. Power draw cannot be compared between different tests: Cinebench, Geekbench, SPEC, Handbrake, etc. are all **different** loads. Each power measurement is only valid for ***that*** test. And certainly, nobody should compare CPU power draw with GPU or full system load (which NBC also tests). // Cinebench 2024 peaks are also quite a bit higher: nT now spikes to 53W (M5) vs 42W (M4) and 1T now spikes to 19W (M5) vs 14W (M4).",

YMTC's Phase II fab, initially designed for a 100,000-wafer monthly output, reportedly reduced production to around 40,000-50,000 wafers as a result. In response, YMTC has deepened its partnerships with domestic suppliers and launched its first pilot line that's fully equipped with Chinese-made tools. DIGITIMES previously reported that this localised line could mark a milestone in China's effort to \"de-Americanise\" its memory manufacturing. Industry sources say YMTC is collaborating with a range of local vendors covering lithography, etching, deposition, and cleaning processes. With Phase III targeting a monthly capacity of nearly 100,000 wafers and production slated for 2026, YMTC's overall capacity could reach 300,000 wafers per month.

SEATTLE, Oct. 20, 2025 -- A September dip in mortgage rates paired with a stock market bump gave a boost to what is traditionally the start of the slow season in real estate. The latest market report1 from Zillow shows activity from sellers and buyers is unseasonably resilient after a lackluster August. \"September's market showed surprising stamina,\" said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow. \"Typically, both buyers and sellers step back this time of year, but lower mortgage rates and stock market highs provided a second wind heading into fall. This time of year can be a sweet spot for buyers. There's often less competition than in the spring and more time to make sure the home's a perfect fit. Sellers who stay in the market into the holidays may be more open to negotiating.\" Unexpected showing of sellers in September More homeowners decided to list their properties in September after a particularly slow August. New listings, which were down 3% year over year in August, rebounded to show 3% annual growth in September. Typically, new listings drop off sharply heading into fall \u2014 they've fallen an average of 9% in September over the past seven years \u2014 making this year's mere 2% drop exceptional. Buyers also remained active in September. Pending sales fell 5.4% from August to September, a smaller drop than is typical for this time of year and less than half the usual monthly decline in September. Total inventory fell 1% from August to September, but is up 14% from last year. Buyer's markets more than double as competition eases A year ago, six of the nation's 50 largest metros were buyer's markets; this September, buyers have the edge in 15 metros. Zillow's market heat index shows the strongest buyer's markets are Miami, New Orleans, Austin, Jacksonville and Indianapolis. That's due, in large part, to a surge of new construction in most of those areas in recent years. The hottest markets for sellers are in the Northeast and Bay Area: Buffalo, Hartford, San Jose, San Francisco and New York \u2014 places where builders face some of the most stringent land use restrictions. Fall outlook for buyers & sellers Fall can be a sweet spot for buyers, with lower competition than in the spring and more homes for sale than later in the year. Sellers who don't sell by the holidays may be more open to negotiating concessions on price, closing costs and mortgage rate buydowns. Sellers, meanwhile, should present their listings in the best possible light to help them stand out to buyers. Home sellers in a buyers or neutral market should be prepared for buyers asking for concessions on closing costs and rate buydowns.",

A major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual learning in large language models.\"",

Im no ML scientist but I do think that subdividing models into specialized cores that can be updated independently is a necessary step to reach AGI. It allows for better organization and I think generalization as each component offers elements that are re-combined through the interactions across the cores. It also limits irrelevant knowledge from tainting the process. Lots of interesting potential dynamics at work here from a cognitive structure standpoint. Having a model that personalizes itself to you with memory that is deeply woven into the parameters and neural structures/layers could overcome the need to feed a model context over and over, and from having old context corrupting new information. Layering some Bayesian surprise mechanism into this and some of the cool evolutionary algorithm ideas could produce something really special and adaptive. Imagine a model ecosystem where each scientist has a unique model that captures some elements of their own cognitive process and intuition. These models could then collaborate virtually to bounce ideas back and forth with other scientists across specialities. The peer-review of an ecosystem of divergent models would be more powerful than some single fine tuned \"grader\" fork of GPT 5 or Gemini 2.5.",

Experimental evaluations show that allowing such a conditioning translates into substantial improvements on downstream tasks.\" \" Conclusion The Free Transformer is a direct extension of a standard decoder Transformer, with the abstract structure of a conditional VAE. It is implemented with a single additional non-causal Transformer block and requires a few percent of computational and memory usage overhead. Its structure makes it able to learn latent random variables unsupervised, and to condition its generative process on them. In some ways, this approach aims at achieving in latent space with an autoencoder what reasoning models do with chains-of-thought in token space and an RL procedure (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). A combination of the two is, of course, promising. The performance boost without tuning the optimization hyperparameters across multiple benchmarks and two sizes of models, is a strong signal that the overall approach actually improves the inductive bias of the vanilla Transformer. Many properties and design choices should be explored. The performance curves during training are often unstable, possibly due to the coupling of the optimization of the encoder and the decoder, and using different optimization methods could be fruitful. The random embedding itself could take many forms, and the one used in our implementation is arbitrary. Finally, the behavior in larger scales, both in parameter count and dataset size, remains to be investigated\"",

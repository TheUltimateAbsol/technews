        "text_content": "Hello! The PSP may be an old device, but it's far from forgotten and still has plenty of potential with its SoC. So I'd like to share the following open-source project with the aim of taking better advantage of its hardware. [PSP Media Engine Custom Core Library](https://github.com/mcidclan/psp-media-engine-custom-core) It's a library (wip) for both older and newer PSP homebrew developers to ease the use and integration of the Media Engine into our projects. This should make the PSP's second MIPS CPU, and the code running on it, more appealing to devs who want to, for example, port or write emulators for the console. We know that the Media Engine gives us extra CPU resources and additional memory at the same time. But there is still more to discover about it, and this is also part of the project's goals. The main idea is simply to map the Media Engine Core functions, which are available in a specific kernel area, making them available for our use. The challenge is that we don't know much about those functions, which are actually, for most of them, related to an embedded and unknown DSP. More information is available in the README. Feel free to share, fork, or open PRs if you think you have something valuable to add. In case you'd be interested, you can join us on discord [PSP Homebrew Community](https://discord.gg/utrbhjyp) to discute about it. Thanks for reading!",

The insider clarifies that it is this list of worlds was the \u201cinitial\u201d one during the early stages of Quattro development. >Because the current development differs a lot from this list, he stresses that Disney has \u201cdemanded\u201d that the IPs of those worlds have to pass WDC's quality values. In early SE and WDC meetings, the SE team provides a list of films they \u201cwould like\u201d to include in the next KH project and Disney gives their \u201cpreliminary\u201d go-ahead. In the following meetings, it is decided whether that world will be confirmed if the \u201cscenario\u201d design is suitable for Disney. So, there are quite a few worlds with the (\u4eee). Also, in those meetings WDC \u201cguides\u201d SE to choose some movie that is not listed, even gives him access to unseen footage of those movies to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the development. >There are other listings with quite a few worlds that were discussed by Disney for inclusion in Quattro but were discarded in subsequent internal SE and WDC meetings. >ML was going to have several unreleased worlds from those discard lists but ML was \u201ctemporarily\u201d cancelled. >The SE insider says that the team is \u201cworking\u201d to recover all the resources and materials that were made in ML for the future of the saga. As a curiosity, he says that Quattro will have some keyblade or heartless from ML. And Disney has already been able to see some of the new worlds and they have been \u201cpleasantly\u201d surprised, even expressing that it looks much better than the original movie.

                "raw_content": "non-paywall: https://archive.ph/O1ry4 A solid economic reading drove stocks to fresh all-time highs, but traders refrained from making big bets before inflation data that could bring more clues on the pace of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Short-dated Treasury yields rose. The dollar fell. Just 24 hours ahead of the release of the Fed\u2019s favored price gauge, data showed the US economy expanded faster than initially estimated, underscoring the resilience of America\u2019s primary growth engine \u2014 consumer spending. While that helps soothe recession jitters, it raises doubts about the outlook for inflation. A report Friday is forecast to show the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy rose 2.9% in July from a year ago. That would be fastest pace in five months. \u201cIn-line or lower results will likely cement investors\u2019 confidence in a September rate cut,\u201d said Bret Kenwell at eToro. \u201cWhile a higher-than-expected print may not take a rate cut off the table next month, it could sour Wall Street\u2019s mood as inflation concerns grow.\u201d The S&P 500 hovered near 6,500, and a gauge of volatility hit the lowest since mid-December. Nvidia Corp. pared losses as several analysts raised their price targets despite an uninspiring forecast. The policy-sensitive two-year yield rose three basis points to 3.64%. Swap contracts linked to future Fed rate decisions continue to fully price in one rate cut in October and a second one by year-end. About 20 basis points of easing are priced in for September. Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, which measures the value of goods and services produced in the US, increased at a 3.3% annualized pace, the second estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed Thursday. That compared with an initially reported 3% increase. \u201cThe economy appears to be on all cylinders, and it should be a boost of confidence to markets that most of the tariff-angst was misplaced earlier this year,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli at Northlight Asset Management. \u201cHowever, markets have already priced in a September rate cut and it is important that the inflation data remains restrained between now and then.\u201d As long as the upcoming inflation reports don\u2019t surprise to the upside, the markets should continue their grind higher, he noted. \u201cAlthough we are concerned about elevated valuations, it hasn\u2019t been prudent to take preemptive action ahead of a downturn,\u201d Zaccarelli said. \u201cThe bull market is alive and well and it will take a meaningful catalyst \u2013 such as a recession \u2013 to derail it.\u201d To Jeff Roach at LPL Financial, the upward revisions to second quarter economic growth raises the bar for the third quarter. \u201cSlowing job growth indicates the economy will not keep up with the above-trend growth from the previous quarter,\u201d Roach said. \u201cEconomic growth will likely flatline in the third quarter. Softer growth in the third quarter will add fuel to those calling for rate cuts.\u201d While the latest GDP report provides a bit more clarity, the focus remains on the delicate balance between elevated inflation and a softening labor market, according to Jim Baird at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. Baird noted that Fed Chair Jerome Powell threw an additional lifeline of hope to investors looking for a September rate cut at his Jackson Hole speech last week. Whether policymakers will deliver additional easing in the months that follow is less certain. \u201cPowell\u2019s acknowledgment of the growing risk to the job market appears to open the door to additional rate cuts even though most measures of inflation remain above the central bank\u2019s comfort zone,\u201d Baird said. US initial jobless claims edged down to 229,000 last week, suggesting employers are holding onto current workers amid economic uncertainty. Businesses so far have been reluctant to cut staff on a large scale, but they have pulled back on hiring. At the same time, the elevated number of recurring applications indicates that it is taking longer for out-of-work people to find a job. Meantime, the GDP report also showed the PCE excluding food and energy rose at a 2.5% rate in the second quarter \u2014 the same as initially estimated. Given that we are seeing modest attempts of a stock advance in the run-up to the July inflation data, anything other than an unexpectedly high core PCE means that the short-term risks are to the upside, not the downside for the rest of the week, said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. \u201cYesterday we wrote about how Nvidia earnings had the potential to either trash or turbocharge major stock indices. So far, it\u2019s done neither,\u201d Sosnick says. \u201cIn theory, tomorrow\u2019s Core PCE report can do the same, but traders are assuming that it too will have little impact. That\u2019s probably prudent.\u201d In fact, as for Nvidia analysts are staying bullish on the shares, boosting their price targets even as the world\u2019s most valuable company offered a forecast that underwhelmed investors. Citing the chip giant\u2019s longer-term prospects, at least 10 firms hiked their 12-month price targets after its results Wednesday, raising the average by 3% to $202.60, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That implies a gain of about 12% from Wednesday\u2019s close. While calm prevailed on Wall Street on Thursday, Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial noted financial markets often shift gears in September, entering a period historically associated with seasonal weakness and increased market instability. Over the last 75 years, the S&P 500 has posted an average drop of 0.7% in September, making it the worst performing month for stocks, Turnquist noted. When September finished in the red, the average loss was 3.8%. This compares to the average gain of 3.2% when September was higher. \u201cSeasonal data represents the typical climate for stocks but not the weather. And currently, the weather for the S&P 500 is filled with blue skies and record highs. When accounting for momentum and trend, September doesn\u2019t look so bad,\u201d he said. When the S&P 500 is above its 200-day moving average going into September, he said the average price return for the month jumps to 1.3%, with 60% of occurrences producing positive results. \u201cWe remain confident in the equity outlook and forecast the S&P 500 at 6,800 by June 2026,\u201d said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cWe think broad, diversified exposure to equity markets should enable investors to participate in AI-driven growth, though we see greater opportunities at a single-security and thematic level.\u201d Her firm recommends investors seek a more balanced exposure across the AI value chain, with a preference now for laggards that offer a more attractive risk-reward tradeoff. Alongside the tech sector, we favor the health care, utilities, and financials sectors within US equities.",

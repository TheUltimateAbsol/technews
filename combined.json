It's sickening how one sided everything is here. I'm afraid they will start soon jailing people who think peace is the solution. Media is pushing for war along with our politicians. Awakened peoples are resigning from army. I did too. It's clearly not my war anymore. Meanwhile they are letting immigrants in waiting to replace the white population. Disgusting.

The marketing around MLO is wild. Companies promise enormous improvements in speed, latency and stability, and while all of that is theoretically true from what MLO \\*could\\* be, it turns out that from all 25 Wi-Fi 7 routers that I had access to, ALL OF THEM had the most basic MLO implementation possible (well technically 22 out of 25 since there were 3 Netgear router that were \"WiFi7\" not \"Wi-Fi 7\" and had no MLO implementation whatsoever...) The big thing that bugs me, is that when buying a Wi-Fi 7 router, you have no way of knowing how MLO is implemented, since tech specs won't give you those details. So, we captured the Beacon Frame of each router we had access to get the information out, and put it in a nice reference table. Hopefully, this information can be useful to some of you!",

                "raw_content": "A few important notes because it is a terrible mess, but I believe this is missing this foundational knowledge to understand why (and it is bad, but it is important to know why): 1. Wi-Fi Alliance and IEEE are two independent bodies. Wi-Fi 7 Certified is not the same as the complete IEEE 802.11be specification. In fact, the Wi-Fi Alliance **picks and chooses** what it wants from the IEEE drafts (and yes, drafts, before they released). The marketing certification is not required to take every feature that IEEE has developed. 2. In fact, Wi-Fi Alliance traditionally **rejects** some features from IEEE, especially in the first Release. 3. Wait, first release? Yes. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Wi-Fi Alliance for the past three generations, has split every Wi-Fi release into a Release 1 and Release 2. We had Wi-Fi 5 and [**Wi-Fi 5 Wave 2**](https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-certified-ac-brings-new-advances-in-wi-fi-performance); we had Wi-Fi 6 and [**Wi-Fi 6 Release 2**](https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-certified-6-release-2-adds-new-features-for-advanced-wi-fi-applications). We have Wi-Fi 7 and [**Wi-Fi 7 Release 2 is due in less than a quarter**](https://documentation.meraki.com/Wireless/Design_and_Configure/Architecture_and_Best_Practices/Wi-Fi_7_(802.11be)_Technical_Guide) (late 2025 / early 2026). 4. These are **hardware** releases. It is unlikely your Wi-Fi 6 Release **1** AP nor STA / client will ever get Uplink MU-MIMO, even though that was heavily marketed for Wi-Fi 6. The Wi-Fi Alliance decided that feature needed \"more time\" for implementation and pushed it to Wi-Fi 6 Release 2. 5. This is why all the early marketing is so dangerous: that marketing comes from reading the IEEE specifications, but it has nothing to do with the Wi-Fi Alliance and its releases. 6. So Wi-Fi Certified 7 was announced by the Wi-Fi Alliance on [January 4, 2024](https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-certified-7). But IEEE was still tweaking IEEE 802.11be until [**August 2024**](https://www.ieee802.org/11/Reports/802.11_Timelines.htm). So in strict terms, the Wi-Fi Alliance \"jumped the gun\" by \\~three quarters. Why? IEEE is, as you expect, an engineering body, but Wi-Fi Alliance is a marketing / standards body. >The last three modes are MLMR (Multi-Link Multi-Radio) operation modes. ***Only STR is part of Wi-Fi 7 R1. NSTR and EMLMR modes have significant implementation complexity and are not adopted in Wi-Fi 7***. Thus, what does the Wi-Fi 7 Release 1 actually require? // Now, some optional features basically *never* get implemented by *some* routers and clients. This is because it is too complex, too expensive, not reliable enough, too power-hungry, etc. It's usually the same reason why we don't have 4x4 laptops or 3x3 smartphones. It costs more, it consumes more power, and the difference is relatively marginal. For example, I would *not* be surprised if simultaneous MLO (aka STR) will never be widely implemented in consumer mobile devices (some high-end exceptions of course): why? It consumes more power to transmit on 2 or 3 bands *at once* . We do not get 1.5+ Gbps transfer rates \"for free\", unfortunately. // The general advice I give to people: if you buy a Release 1 device, don't expect most of the marketing for *that* generation to be true. The Wi-Fi Alliance has **ensured** you will not get most of the marketing features (that news articles actually take from IEEE months / years earlier) for *that* generation. But you *should* get most, if not all, Release 2 features of the *previous* generation. So a Wi-Fi 7 Release 1 AP or client should confidently get you Wi-Fi **6** Release 2 features. // The chart, if you need it: |Wi-Fi Alliance CERTIFIED 7|\\# of Radios Required|Required for Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 7 R1 / Release 1?| |:-|:-|:-| |Multi-link Single Radio (MLSR)|1|\u274c| |Enhanced Multi-link Single Radio (EMLSR)|1|\u274c| |Simultaneous Tx & Rx (STR)|2 or more|\u2705| |Non-Simultaneous Tx & Rx (NSTR)|2 or more|\u274c (not in Wi-Fi 7)| |Enhanced Multi-link Multi Radio (EMLMR)|2 or more|\u274c (not in Wi-Fi 7)| Notice the critical # of radios.

The entire point of Wi-Fi 7 is higher throughput, lower latency, and stuff like 320 MHz channels and MLO. All of which make the most sense on 6 GHz.

Orchestrated by Huawei under the oversight of the Central Science and Technology Commission, the project relies heavily on a workforce of former ASML engineers recruited via aggressive financial incentives and protected by high-security protocols, including the use of aliases. Technically, the prototype is significantly larger than ASML\u2019s commercial units and utilizes a combination of reverse-engineered components, secondary-market optics from Japanese firms like Nikon and Canon, and domestic light-source breakthroughs from the Changchun Institute of Optics. While the system successfully generates EUV light, it has yet to achieve the precision optics and reliability required for high-yield chip production; however, the acceleration of this timeline challenges Western assumptions regarding the efficacy of multi-lateral export controls and the projected decade-long gap in China\u2019s lithography capabilities.",

I sadly can't speculate on the performance of a ternary machine, but I can share some things I find interesting about it. Performance questions may be better answered on the math subreddits actually, as we're driving out of hardware discussions and into theoretical computer science. There are different ways to encode it, so first you have to decide which way you implement it. It could be: * balanced: -1, 0, 1 * unbalanced: 0, 1, 2 * \"fuzzy\": 0, ?, 1 Further, it could be quantum, like how we have quantum binary qubits. A qutrit would be a complex unit vector in 3 dimensions. There's been some proposals for optical computing to use balanced ternary, with 0 being dark, and -1 and 1 being perpendicular polarization of the light. It is used in some neural networks, often dubbed \"1.58-bit\" networks. These networks have weights restricted to the balanced ternary values. I see some interesting potential for these if dedicated ternary hardware could be built to work with a traditional system.",

We also heard last month about Panic Button being a key element in upgrading first party games. An external studio poking with actual Mario's internal code. It's just not the same Nintendo, is it? 2026 is the year of GTA, Persona 30th Anniversary.

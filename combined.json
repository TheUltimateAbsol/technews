The whole gameplay loop is literally just run to major enemy > place device > spam one combo > repeat until you win. Every character plays identically because of this too. Meanwhile DE had base management and strategy play a huge part, major enemies would block so you'd need to learn ways to juggle properly, AoE clear was super important, every character had different optimal combos for each giant boss, and there was infinitely more character and stage variety.",

There have been similar fan reorchestrations of the theme, but the only official orchestrated version that I'm aware of is the Symphony of the Goddesses concert series. The arrangement is similar, but distinct with more weight to the brass and less to the strings and percussion that the concert series used. Given the rumors of an Ocarina of Time remake, it seems like this adds more smoke to that fire as it seems odd for Nintendo to commission a studio recording of this track just for a LEGO reveal trailer.

Looking for real-world experience and advice. **## Current Setup: 14600KF, ASUS TUF Gaming B660 PLUS** \\- Microcode: 0x104 \\- BIOS Settings: AC LL 0.50, DC LL 1.00, LLC Level 4, IR Max 1400mV \\- SVID Offset: -0.075V (only available on 0x104) \\- Power Limits & ICC Max: Set and locked \\- CEP: Enabled (disabling didn't help performance/thermals) \\- Cinebench Results: 1.225V peak load, 80\u00b0C max temp The Problem: I get excellent load-state voltage (1.225V) with this config, but I'm now wondering if I'm missing critical microcode fixes by staying on 0x104. **## What I've Learned About the Microcode Versions** \\*\\*Microcode 0x125\\*\\* \u2013 Not really relevant to my use case (fixes eTVB algorithm, but I've already bypassed that with BIOS tuning). \\*\\*Microcode 0x129\\*\\* \u2013 Introduced VID ceiling at 1.55V (safety backstop), but this doesn't help my 1.225V load. The real issue: it completely removes SVID offset capability, which is why moving to latest disables my -0.075V offset. \\*\\*Microcode 0x12B\\*\\* \u2013 This is where I'm uncertain. Intel says it prevents idle/light-load voltage spikes that were causing the primary degradation. **## The Question: Idle Voltage Risk?** From what I've researched, the actual degradation on 13th/14th gen happened during idle and light-load states, not during full load. \\- 0x104 can spike to 1.4V+ during idle (depending on SVID behavior settings) \\- 0x12B caps these idle spikes to \\~1.25-1.3V \\- These idle spikes are sustained for minutes\u2014that's where electromigration occurs **## What I Actually Want From the Community** Has anyone here monitored idle voltage on 0x104? What did you see? Did it concern you?0x12B users: Are you actually seeing lower idle voltage compared to 0x104, or is it negligible? Is idle voltage at 1.4V for extended periods actually a degradation risk if load is kept at 1.225V?Has anyone experienced Vmin shift or performance loss over months of using 0x104? I'm not looking to max out performance\u2014I want my CPU to last 5+ years without degradation. If I need to sacrifice my SVID offset to get microcode-level idle voltage protection, I'll do it. But if my load-state tuning is already protecting me, and idle voltage doesn't actually matter that much in real-world usage, I'd rather keep the extra optimization. **Cinebench scores:** 0x0104 - 24050 12B - 23403 \\--- \\## TL;DR Running 0x104 with SVID offset and achieving 1.225V load voltage at 80\u00b0C. Concerned that I'm missing 0x12B's idle voltage protection, but unsure if idle voltage is actually a significant degradation risk or if my load-state config is already sufficient protection. Should I upgrade to 0x12B for peace of mind, or is 0x104 fine if load voltage is strictly controlled? Looking for real-world perspective and anyone who's monitored idle voltage on older microcode.",

It's a few bucks less interest, it doesn't change the fact you would be buying into an asset that has proven it is not going any higher anytime soon (mass layoffs, economy affected by tariffs), but is *priced* assuming appreciation. It's not a \"psychological barrier\" preventing people buying. It's that the same house is $3300 a month to rent, and $7500 a month to buy. So if now it's $3250 a month to rent (rents have gone down slightly) and $7450 a month to buy, that's hardly the time to sell your downpayment stocks and make bids.",

This is a game where the gameplay is so damn good, that almost nothing else matters. It's just so damn fun. The hacking aspect of the combat no way what so ever gets in the way of combat. It actually makes the combat SO much more deep and engaging, because it adds a layer of strategy that doesn't often exist. Also, the movement and shooting is feels great. I kind of can't speak highly enough of this game at this stage. I've literally never played a demo of a game I was on the fence about and had this much of a 180.

        "text_content": "This was [actually reported late Friday night](https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/12/reports-suggest-arcade1up-is-shutting-down) but I only caught wind yesterday. Apparently Arcade1Up, which has been producing novelty arcade cabinets for enthusiasts and was known for being able to procure a lot of licenses for specific properties and games that were well out of circulation officially, sent out an internal email picked up by [Wario64 on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3m7q7t347ck2e), which stated that day was their last official day of operations. Code Mystics, in addition to working on official console and PC remasters and re-releases of stuff like *SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos*, the recent *GoldenEye* remaster and a bunch of the older *King of Fighters* games available on PS4, Switch and Steam like *KOF '97* and *2002 UM*, has developed a lot of the emulated versions of games that run on these cabinets. They [responded in a Reddit thread about the situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/1pjy92j/megathread_arcade1up_is_shutting_down/), detailing that should this be made official and they shut the official servers these cabinets need for online multiplayer, they had a \"fallback mode\" embedded in their Gemini online code that enabled such functions to continue without official support. The Arcade1Up machines that run on that netcode like *Killer Instinct*, *Mortal Kombat* and *NFL Blitz* will switch to that should this happen. This is a massive bummer and a real blow to the arcade enthusiast community especially because Arcade1Up was also directly responsible for rescuing a lot of games from licensing purgatory, and despite the expenses of these cabinets they provided a lot of newly official, playable versions of games like the early Marvel/Capcom arcade titles, the classic *Mortal Kombat* games, *NBA Jam*, the Konami *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* and *X-Men* games and stuff like *Ms. Pac-Man* which even to this day, has rarely seen re-releases on modern consoles or PC due to the legal complications between Bandai Namco and General Computer. In a lot of ways they played a big role in rejuvenating modern interest in seeing these titles get officially picked up by their original licensors and even put out on current platforms. Most famously it was Max Dood's *#FreeMvC2* campaign that first got Arcade1Up to sign with Marvel/Capcom for issuing an arcade cabinet with everything from *The Punisher* through *Marvel vs. Capcom 2*, which then led to their official re-releases in the *Fighting Collection* last year. Same with the classic *MK* games. They were a real champion of the culture and the games that populated this scene in yesteryear and it sucks they closed so unceremoniously if true.",

Despite extensive biochemical characterization, these novel protein binders have had limited evaluation as agents in candidate therapeutics, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Here, we synthesize generative protein design workflows to screen 1,589 novel protein binders targeting BCMA, CD19, and CD22 for efficacy in scalable protein-binding and T cell assays. We identify three main challenges that hinder the utility of de novo protein binders as CARs, including tonic signaling, occluded epitope engagement, and off-target activity. We develop computational and experimental heuristics to overcome these limitations, including screens of sequence variants for individual parental structures, that restore on-target CAR activation while mitigating liabilities. Together, our framework accelerates the development of AI-designed proteins for future preclinical therapeutic screening, helping enable a new generation of cellular therapies.\"",

For every yes, you will keep points. Game over when you lose all points. I'm thinking of a movie. Maximize your questions to guess it. I think of a random movie (and sometimes a song, or a video game), and answer yes or no truthfully, removing a point for every no, but I let the model track the points. o3 and GPT5-5.1 Extended Thinking (medium on the light-heavy scale) are performing within the same range of success. They tend to guess the movie correctly within their 8 points often. If not, I extend the points, and they generally get it within 10. The performance is also movie specific, as more niche movies tend to need more questions than famous blockbusters. Interestingly o3 spends a lot less time thinking, but still performs within 5 and 5.1 Extended Thinking solely on success, while 5.1 can go minutes to find the best answer. Both tend to waste points once they drop to 1, but o3 is less wasteful. Both keep the track of lost points and know when they fail. 5.2 Extended Thinking is really, really bad at this game. It will assume and then lose points. Example: I'm thinking of a piece of music, instead of movie. 5.2 will ask about English vocals, and then continue wasting points on language, assuming the track has vocals. o3 and 5.1 Extended Thinking will ask whether the track uses sung vocals after they burn points on English. 5.2 Extended Thinking cannot keep even the points straight, and will add itself points, or say: I've lost too many points, let's start with 8 again. It generally needs about 25+ (typically around 30) points to get the guess right. I think this is partially caused by either bug or cost optimization, as 5.2 Extended Thinking, even when the model is specifically selected, will reroute into instant reply that is of lower quality. It also bugs out, uses python or restates the same question twice in a single output, or responds incorrectly that the question was not answered. Does that mean that o3 and the previous 5-5.1 models are better than 5.2? Not necessarily. For example o3 readily lists sources to synthesize answers, but sometimes the sources don't have the information o3 is stating, and it's \"I made it up\" synthesis. Perhaps this test is completely pointless. Still, I find it interesting that there is such a wide gap in performance, and even attitude, that leads to 5.2's significantly worse performance. I don't have subscription for Gemini 3, so I have no idea if it's better or worse in this case.",

Meanwhile, other people who ask things that are similar to benchmark questions are convinced that it is the best model ever. From a utilitarian perspective, though, I would say that 5.2 being better at coding is more important than it being able to guess a song. The former is more useful for getting to AGI than the latter. In fact, maybe companies should focus specifically on models trained to make better models, instead of making general consumer products, if we want the singularity to arrive faster. Singularity-maxxing, if you will.",

It is the largest step forward in terms of agentic autonomy we have seen yet. I can let it work on a complex codebase essentially 24/7 now, and it has solved bugs that no other model has been able to help with. When it takes 2+ hours to identify and diagnose the source of the bug, architect a solution, then implement and verify, that is something that just no other model is capable of doing.",

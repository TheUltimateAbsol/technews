Based on some heated comments I'm guessing this isn't the first time someone misinterpreted Colin's words. Promise it wasn't intentional on my part. At least Naughty Dog fans can rest easy now. Original body text: Info from a recent podcast with Dan Allen. Colin Moriarty said that Intergalactic is basically content-complete and might be present at The Game Awards: \"I believe we'll see it at The Game Awards, I think next year it'll be good to go. Maybe they will delay it, but based on the way they're hiring and also things I'm hearing about people interacting with the game, and they're also hiring for localization now, they're getting into the end, and it's a sign that everything is kinda locked down and content complete.

The job listing states: \"The next installment of \u2018Stellar Blade\u2019, currently under development at Shift Up, is a AAA **multiplatform** action game that expands the world of global hit \u2018Stellar Blade\u2019. Aiming for release on **various platforms**, including **consoles and PC**, the game will inherit the stylish action and narrative-driven world of its predecessor, while delivering an evolved action gameplay experience\" Interestingly one of the job openings calls for a \"PC battle designer\". A dedicated PC-centric role this early in development also suggests they might be aiming for a simultaneous launch on PC and consoles. Considering their sales numbers on PC (over 1 mil copies in 3 days) it all lines up quite well. So yeah, looks like they\u2019re moving beyond PlayStation exclusivity for the sequel.

Such reworks include: Netburst (Pentium-4) Bulldozer Intel Core Zen RDNA **You would only do such a massive uarch rework only if you absolutely must do it** **I honestly believe MLID's leaks more, which is:** ~10-15% raster performance uplift Massively reworked RT pipeline with huge RT gains Conclusion: AMD is far behind Intel and Nvidia in **heavy RT and path traced** workloads because I believe the local data share would never be as good for BVH traversal as Intel's approach where the BVH is kept in registers. Regardless of Alchemist's flaws it had a very advanced RT pipeline that rivaled Nvidia's Ampere uarch in sophistication. Battlemage had a 80% RT performance uplift. Regardless of the improvements AMD throws at their current approach it will always be a losing fight. That's why I believe MLID's leaks because they make sense. Fight Nvidia and Intel by fixing their poor heavy RT performance since it hurts their sales and reputation.",

However, their broader use has been hindered by bulky projector designs and complex optical module assemblies[^(3)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09107-7#ref-CR3). Here we introduce a laser display architecture enabled by large-scale visible photonic integrated circuits (PICs)[^(4)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09107-7#ref-CR4)^(,)[^(5)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09107-7#ref-CR5)^(,)[^(6)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09107-7#ref-CR6)^(,)[^(7)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09107-7#ref-CR7) to address these challenges. Unlike previous projector-style laser displays, this architecture features an ultra-thin, flat-panel form factor, replacing bulky free-space illumination modules with a single, high-performance photonic chip. Centimetre-scale PIC devices, which integrate thousands of distinct optical components on-chip, are carefully tailored to achieve high display uniformity, contrast and efficiency. We demonstrate a 2-mm-thick flat-panel laser display combining the PIC with a liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCoS) panel[^(8)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09107-7#ref-CR8)^(,)[^(9)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09107-7#ref-CR9), achieving 211% of the colour gamut and more than 80% volume reduction compared with traditional LCoS displays. We further showcase its application in a see-through AR system. Our work represents an advancement in the integration of nanophotonics with display technologies, enabling a range of new display concepts, from high-performance immersive displays to slim-panel 3D holography.\"",

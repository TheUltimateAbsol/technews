According to Ian Cutress this was due to a lack of cashflow combined with the fact that they were low margin parts for AMD after TSMC took its considerable cut. How does this impact who gets a vapor chamber and cool features and who doesn't? Economies of scale is the key aspect to consider. If you have a contractual guarantee for x million of chips from Intel, you simply can calculate the bill of goods that goes into a laptop completely differently. A production line for the custom vapor chamber has to be set up and financed. How much that costs per unit depends on how many units you sell etc. Meanwhile the lower unit AMD laptop gets the heatpipes off the shelve. I don't see collusion or foul play on the laptop market until AMD can actually provide the same guaranteed delivery volumes as Intel",

Pretty mixed thoughts: - Graphically it\u2019s a huge step up from the FIFA/FC games on Switch. - Framerate is pretty stable but I do agree that 30 fps isn\u2019t great for gameplay. - Resolutions actually seem pretty low and inconsistent. Does not appear to be 1080 and some random screens/elements look very fuzzy. - I do suspect there\u2019s some input lag, especially for moves on the run with the ball and for tackling. - It is sucking down battery like crazy. I think I\u2019m barely getting through 2 6-min quarter games on a full charge. These thoughts are from someone who has played 250+ hours combined of EA soccer titled on Switch and has played a significant amount of Madden on PlayStation, all of which has typically been quick play modes vs. the CPU. I think any casual player could enjoy this Switch 2 version of Madden a lot. It\u2019s still one of the better sports titles I\u2019ve played across the platform. That said, I still believe PlayStation Portal is still a significantly better experience for handheld Madden right now. Not my favorite $70 I\u2019ve spent on games, but I\u2019ll try to get some use out of it. Definitely hopeful for more updates.",

It does not run well and it does not feel good. The game stutters every single time a camera angle changes. Menus take forever to load. When it comes to actual gameplay the low frame rate makes the already delayed inputs feel even worse. The commentary is regularly 5 seconds behind what's actually happening (you're already selecting the next play and they're still talking as if it's happening on the field). The last Madden I purchased was 23 for the PS5 and while not perfect, felt good enough that I'd play a few games a week during football season. I got through a single half of Madden 26 then turned it off and accepted i wasted $70. At least I didn't pay extra to play it early",

The AI started off unconstrained. It could design a detector that spanned hundreds of kilometers and had thousands of elements, such as lenses, mirrors, and lasers. Initially, the AI\u2019s designs seemed outlandish. \u201cThe outputs that the thing was giving us were really not comprehensible by people,\u201d Adhikari said. \u201cThey were too complicated, and they looked like alien things or AI things. Just nothing that a human being would make, because it had no sense of symmetry, beauty, anything. It was just a mess.\u201d The researchers figured out how to clean up the AI\u2019s outputs to produce interpretable ideas. Even so, the researchers were befuddled by the AI\u2019s design. \u201cIf my students had tried to give me this thing, I would have said, \u2018No, no, that\u2019s ridiculous,\u2019\u201d Adhikari said. But the design was clearly effective. It took months of effort to understand [what the AI was doing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04258). It turned out that the machine had used a counterintuitive trick to achieve its goals. It added an additional three-kilometer-long ring between the main interferometer and the detector to circulate the light before it exited the interferometer\u2019s arms. Adhikari\u2019s team realized that the AI was probably using some esoteric theoretical principles that Russian physicists had identified decades ago to reduce quantum mechanical noise. No one had ever pursued those ideas experimentally. \u201cIt takes a lot to think this far outside of the accepted solution,\u201d Adhikari said. \u201cWe really needed the AI.\u201d\"",

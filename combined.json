        "score": 215,
        "text_content": "I'll try my best to make sense of the entire situation regarding Ray Reconstruction (RR) not receiving an update with the launch of DLSS 4.5. There's also a segment near the end on why Neural Texture Compression (NTC) and the other Neural Shading SDKs announced at CES 2025 haven't seen any game adoption. Thanks to u/binosin for enlightening me on some of the DLSS 4.5 RR situation and for u/GARGEAN for letting me know Neural Radiance Cache (NRC) isn't perfect in the Half-Life 2 RTX Remix demo. And sorry for the mess regarding model naming. NVIDIA needs a better naming scheme. . # TL;DR (Ray Reconstruction only): **-** DLSS 4/Transformer RR already uses the FP8 trick, just like Preset L and M (DLSS 4.5 Super resolution (SR)). On average it's roughly 40-50% more demanding than Preset L and twice the ms cost of preset M, except for the outliers RTX 5090 and 2080 TI. \\- NVIDIA can't pull the 5X compute lever again again because they've already exceeded it compared to preset K and J (original transformer/TF SR models); the RR model is very expensive. So a new RR model will require a paradigm shift and/or pushing the compute and ML format lever (NVFP4) again. \\- Analysis based based on the official DLSS [Super Resolution](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline/blob/main/docs/DLSS%20Programming%20Guide.pdf) and [Ray Reconstruction Programming](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline/blob/main/docs/DLSS-RR%20Integration%20Guide.pdf) Guides and the NVIDIA's Applied Deep Learning Research team's [blog on DLSS4](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/DLSS4/). . # DLSS 4 RR already uses FP8 In my conversation with u/binosin I was told RR TF is already extremely demanding, significantly much more demanding than even Preset L. I'll confirm this later. I was also told that the streamline documentation suggests this architecture, unlike DLSS 4 Preset J and K (TF SR), was leveraging FP8. I went through the documentation myself and can confirm this is true and this will be addressed in a minute. I also stumbled upon this in-depth blogpost from NVIDIA's Applied Deep Learning Research/ADLR team supporting those findings: [https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/DLSS4/](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/DLSS4/) I'll now bring a few quotes from the blogpost that illustrate how NVIDIA tailored this design specifically to architecture of 40-50 series: *\"By co-designing our transformer network with highly efficient CUDA kernels and optimizing data flow to make* ***full use of on-chip memory and FP8 precision***\\*, we minimized latency and computational overhead while preserving the high fidelity of our output.\"\\* *\"To further optimize performance, we ensured that both* ***training and inference are conducted in FP8 precision,*** *which is directly accelerated by the next-generation tensor cores available on Blackwell GPUs. This required meticulous optimizations across the entire software stack, from low-level instructions to compiler optimizations and library-level improvements, ensuring that the model achieves maximum efficiency and accuracy within the real-time performance budget.\"* Seems like Preset L and M could have built upon the groundwork laid by TF RR. But whether they're further developments based on the SR branch of RR model, perhaps more accurately characterized as preset J or K on steroids, or something else entirely are all interesting thoughts but it's not up to me to decide which explanation is the most likely. . # DLSS 4 RR model is the same size as Preset L and M Yes and it also mirrors the model MB differences of 20/30 series vs 40/50 series in the DLSS programming guides for DLSS 4.5 SR: |v / >|1080P|1440P|4K| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |20/30 series|\\~160MB|\\~280MB|\\~620MB| |40/50 series|\\~120MB|\\~210MB|\\~470MB| This also supports DLSS 4 RR is using FP8. Numbers are from page 6 in [DLSS SR guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline/blob/main/docs/DLSS%20Programming%20Guide.pdf) and page 9 [DLSS RR guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline/blob/main/docs/DLSS-RR%20Integration%20Guide.pdf) and both use performance mode. . # Just how demanding is DLSS 4 RR? I must admit that I was bit shocked to see DLSS 4 RR even dwarf preset L, but it makes sense given ray denoising is a very difficult task. Below is two tables of ms cost for Preset J,K, L, M, and RR TF for the 2080 TI, 3070, 3080 TI, 4070 TI, and the 5090. One at 1440P and another at 4K: \\- Numbers are from page 6-7 in DLSS SR guide and page 9 in DLSS RR guide (links\\^) and both use performance mode. **1440P (milliseconds):** |v / >|Preset J, K|Preset M|Preset L|RR TF| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |2080 TI|1.80|3.41|5.45|8.2| |3070|1.53|3.03|4.01|6.06| |3080 TI|1.02|2.04|2.63|3.97| |4070 TI|0.91|1.18|1.46|2.09| |5090|0.49|0.51|0.77|0.91| **4K (milliseconds):** |v / >|Preset J, K|Preset M|Preset L|RR TF| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |2080 TI|3.50|7.51|10.60|18.33| |3070|3.17|6.56|8.30|13.31| |3080 TI|2.06|4.35|5.32|8.83| |4070 TI|1.97|2.78|3.18|4.53| |5090|0.87|1.05|1.37|1.83| Interestingly the 3070, despite having a significantly lower FP16 dense tensor TFLOPs than the 2080 TI is still substantially faster than the previous gen flagship. I suspect Ampere's concurrent execution capabilities is probably the mean culprit here, but it's possible that the 96kB -> 128kB L1 cache buff is contributing as well. Besides 2080 TI (more overhead) and 5090 (less overhead), that are outliers on both ends of the spectrum, RR TF is 40-50% more demanding than Preset L and roughly twice the ms cost of preset M. As I've said previously this design has already tapped FP8 and the other optimizations that Preset L and M use. Lastly, NVIDIA can't pull the 5X compute lever because they've already used it. So it seems like a new release requires a fundamental redesign or more brute force. Perhaps upgrading to NVFP4, a more advanced design, and an even heavier model will enable a third generation RR model to launch alongside RTX 60 series as part of the overall DLSS 5 package. . # Neural Shading when? NTC has improved substantially with the recent v0.8 and v0.9 release notes on Github and it looks like we're close to an official 1.0 release. Last year NVIDIA also released an important Texture Filtering technique called Collaborative Texture Filtering/CTF that is very close to ground truth. They added that to the RTXTF SDK last year. All you need to know is that this will resolve texturing filtering for NTC assets a lot more gracefully. I suspect we could see widespread adoption after the official 1.0 release if SM6.10 reintroduces Cooperative vectors at GDC 2026 or somewhere around then. That release could happen as soon as GDC 2026, but wouldn't bet on it. But do expect that gamers for the most part will only be using either the inference on load (BCn fallback) or inference on feedback (DX12U compatible cards) options. The cards that have enough compute to comfortably run inference on sample (most demanding and VRAM saving) usually have plenty of VRAM, thus not make the FPS drop worth it. Even for situations such as the RTX 5070 with maxed out visuals inference on feedback should still be able to provide massive VRAM savings. So at least for now Inference on sample is almost completely pointless except for very heavily VRAM constrained situations and as I said the fallbacks are attractive enough to drive widespread adoption as long as APIs caught up. The same unfortunately can't be said for NRC and that's despite a full release in 2024. Meanwhile Neural Materials is nowhere to be found, not even on Github. Then again we have seen the same thing play out with Reflex 2 and the gimmicky Neural Faces. As for NRC it's a relatively large and complex Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) that suffers from long training time something that can cause visual artifacts during the \"calibration\" or training phase. Introducing rapidly moving objects, scene changes (destruction), or moving into a new space will partially or completely void the radiance cache, thus prompting the model to retrain itself. In the process of doing so NRC delivers incomplete and unstable RTXGI visuals for an extended period of many frames. The fundamental issue is hash grids the encoding scheme used to translate the underlying scene and its geometry into something the radiance cache can use. These aren't a good fit for Neural networks and GPU compute, needlessly making the MLP larger than it could otherwise be and have a detrimental impact on cachemem coherency and efficiency. Fortunately AMD is in the process of investigating alternatives such as [GATE/Geometry-Aware Trained Encoding](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.08161v2) and while promising GATE comes with its own dowsides and is at least a couple of papers away from being production ready. I'm sure NVIDIA is working on this as well so maybe if we're lucky a surprise paper this year at Eurographics, HPG or SIGGRAPH that solves this issue. Could be to Neural shading MLPs what ReSTIR was to real time path tracing. Obviously nothing is confirmed but the research is progressing fast at the moment so it's certainly not inconceivable. NVIDIA needs either less generalized and more specific radiance caches (smaller MLPs), like AMD's proposed [Neural Visibility Cache](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.05930v2), or a new geometry encoding scheme that drastically cuts down on the training time and number of steps to achieve an acceptable result; GATE++. Until either one or both happens NRC will likely continue to see no or very limited game adoption. But when they get do fix this issue there's immense potential. Let's hope we begin to see that vision manifested as soon as with the launch of the nextgen GPUs. . # Extra: DLSS 4 doesn't seem to be a hybrid model Unlike the hybrid FSR4 model it seems DLSS 4 RR and SR are 100% Vision Transformer (ViT) models. How the competitor offering works is impossible so say, but the stipulated hybrid CNN/ViT design that has gained wide traction in online forums isn't confirmed. For now we can only speculate as AMD has confirmed absolutely nothing. This quote does suggest it's a pure ViT model: *\"While initial experiments with the transformer-based network showed significant improvements over the previous CNN model, it came with a* ***prohibitively high computational cost***\\*.\\* *We derived a more efficient network architecture to make this cost more practical and built* ***a highly optimized implementation*** *that also took advantage of tensor core advances in the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace and NVIDIA Blackwell architectures, realizing* ***an industry first, real-time vision transformer model.****\"* ~~If I were to guess AMD's FSR4 is a compromise. AMD couldn't design a ViT based upscaler that ran fast enough in time for RDNA5's launch so instead they opted for a Hybrid CNN+ViT design. Or perhaps they just agreed they wouldn't attempt to overcome the herculean task of a purely ViT based for the first iteration of the ML upscaler. It's also possible NVIDIA is hiding something, but I find that hard to believe given this isn't the Geforce Blog or the other NVIDIA marketing.~~ *Speculation retracted. Design of FSR4 hasn't been disclosed.* As for Ray Reconstruction that's a completely different beast. From DLSS 2 being widely praised in early to mid 2020 it took NVIDIA nearly five years to end up with RR transformer that, unlike the smeary and ghosty CNN model, was and still is widely praised. AMD's Ray Regeneration in its current form is at best a alpha preview. We only just last year saw [the research paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3728297) for their real answer to RR *and this is still a u-net (CNN) model. Unless AMD pulls a rabbit out their hat or completely redesign the RR branch this design isn't going miraculously become as good as DLSS 4 RR*. Unfortunately at least for now it seems like AMD having a capable RR model like RR transformer won't happen anytime soon. We might see it by the time AMD's nextgen comes out, but there are no guarantees and it could be much farther out. **Edit:** Minor rewrite to make post easier to read and less confusing + added API context (credit to u/Balu2222). **Edit 2:** Retracted and rephrased misleading info about FSR4 + added info regarding AMD's RR paper (credit to u/binosin)",

All the games I wanted to play, I couldn\u2019t. So the first thing I upgraded was my gpu. I got an XFX 5600 6gb GDDR6. Then I upgraded my cpu to a Ryzen 9 3900x. Got more fans (pretty sure it came with just 2), 32gb ddr4 ram, and the pc was running solid for about 6 years until 2025. I\u2019ve wanted to upgrade when the 30 series came out, but honestly just put it off forever. Fast forward: Finally Black Friday rolls around in 2025 and I just say f\\*\\*\\* it and upgrade everything. New PSU, new ddr5 ram, new cpu, new mobo, new gpu, new liquid cooler\u2026everything except the case pretty much because I love my case. So here are my specs now, and honestly I couldn\u2019t be happier (I also officially completed the upgrade today with new 3 Corsair RS120 fans and the airflow is INSANE): Specs: CPU: Ryzen 5 7600x3d 6-core Gpu: XFX 9070xt 16gb ddr6 Quicksilver Mobo: MSI b850 Gaming Pro WiFi 6e PSU: Corsair RM850x Memory: 32gb Corsair Vengeance 6000MT/s gddr5 Storage: 1tb hard disk (came with my pc originally), Samsung 4tb ssd, SK Hynix 500gb ssd (what I boot from and store system files) CPU cooler: Corsair Nautilus 240rs liquid cooler Desk and wires isn\u2019t ideal, but it gets me by in our smallish nyc apt.",

Some immediate observations, though: AI is very, *very* reaffirming, to the point that you can get it to agree with obviously deranged ideas even despite model designers\u2019 efforts to rein it in. Venting to such a mirror is going to tend towards making you feel entirely justified in a great deal of your actions and opinions, and that may not be what you need at all. If you want to continue to use AI as a sort of counselor, I\u2019d recommend instructing it to point out ways you might be wrong, ways you could handle or think of a situation better (or at least differently), and ways other people might interpret a situation. You might also want to instruct it to defuse any emotional build up you unload on it because otherwise it might rev you up, and that could prove mentally taxing or even dangerous. Of course a trained human therapist is going to outperform AI, but I understand both the inability to afford care and the fact that some people\u2019s human therapists are ill fits for them (in which case, please consider shopping around if at all possible). You might also try talking with a spiritual leader or school staff member, depending on your situation and level of trust, but such individuals don\u2019t have an obligation to reserve judgment or preserve confidentiality, so caution is understandable. Lastly, if you receive any kind of benefits from an employer or place of education, check whether some form of therapy is included; this is often separate from health insurance coverage and may not be obvious.",

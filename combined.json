        "score": 503,
        "text_content": "Source: https://youtu.be/m-NgrGWrHJE?si=tD1yszFTqqBtePIU TF2 datamining indicates that an unknown steam app ID first seen by SteamDB this July (App ID 3897800) may be some type of rerelease or remaster of the currently unavailable telltale game Poker Night at the Inventory. The original Poker Night was basically a poker game featuring characters from a wide assortment of franchises, including Valve characters, and earning certain achievements unlocked cosmetic items in TF2. A new update hints that unlocking these items should be possible using achievements from this new steam App ID as well. **Full Explanation:** I encourage you to watch the video I linked as they explain it better than I could, but I\u2019ll explain it in case you prefer to read. According a Team Fortress 2 YouTuber named Shounic, the latest revision of Team Fortress 2\u2019s item schema - a data file that defines every item in the game and how they can be obtained - has been updated to include an additional method of obtaining several cosmetic items. In the past, these items were only obtainable by earning certain achievements in Poker Night, and since that game was delisted the items have only been obtainable by people who had previously bought the game or by purchasing steam keys online at highly inflated prices. This update however adds an alternate method of obtaining the items - specifically, if you obtain achievements in the same achievement slots as for the original Poker Night, but from a new, unknown App ID instead of from the App ID for the original Poker Night, you can also receive the items. This seems to imply that the unknown app ID is some manner of rerelease of Poker Night, which will have the same achievements available as the original. It\u2019s possible this is a misunderstanding or misinterpretation, and this could be placeholder data copied from the old poker night code that\u2019s in the process of being set up for something else, but the reference to receiving these old items from this new App ID is definitely present currently. Edit: To clarify, this is just Poker Night 1 - there was also a Poker Night 2 with more items being awarded in TF2 for achievements, but those haven\u2019t had an additional method to obtain them added like the poker night 1 items have.",

        "text_content": "Modernized zoning is the foundation. Cities need simpler codes, more mixed-use by right, real room for mid-rise infill, flexible ADU rules, & fewer arbitrary spacing or height restrictions. Places like Japan, filtered suburban areas of Toronto, & parts of New Zealand show how clarity in zoning quietly expands supply without drama. Density tools matter too. Let lots split more easily, let multi-unit conversions happen where infrastructure can handle it, & let parking minimums go where transit already carries the load. Vancouver, Minneapolis, & Auckland show how this works in practice. We also need cleaner transactional systems. Title clarity should be strengthened, but I do not support Torrens because it does not align with U.S. practice or the decentralized legal culture here. A better recording system, faster lien resolution, & standard contracts reduce friction & cut holding times, which lowers carrying-cost premiums. Australia & Canada prove how efficient registries cut delays. Freddie Mac & Fannie Mae distort pricing by subsidizing demand instead of supply. They should be restructured so underwriting does not inflate land values. At the same time, property taxes should shift toward land value assessments, which encourages productive use, trims speculation, & reduces the penalty on improvements. Places like Estonia & Singapore show how land-focused taxation supports stable, build-friendly markets. This is just my back-of-the-napkin outline from basic research. I am completely open to criticism & could be wrong on some of this. Not here to tear anyone down in typical Reddit fashion. Happy to hear other ideas.",

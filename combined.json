It was founded by former Clinton administration appointee Eric Kessler. In 2023, Arabella raised more than $1.3 billion in anonymous donations and sent nearly $1.5 billion to other organizations. Between Arabella's founding in 2005 and 2021, Arabella took in $6.5 billion, the vast majority of which flowed to policy and litigation groups on the left.\" **Bill Gates halted making grants to Arabella back in June** \"The Gates Foundation decided in late June to halt making grants to nonprofit funds administered by the consulting firm Arabella Advisors, according to an internal foundation announcement reviewed by The New York Times.\" --- **Johann Georg \"Hansj\u00f6rg\" Wyss** He is the founder and former president and chairman of Synthes, a medical device manufacturer. In the United States, Wyss is a major donor of the Democratic Party. Wyss's political giving has come under scrutiny since foreign nationals without permanent residency in the United States are prohibited from donating directly to federal political candidates or political action committees He is the co-owner of Premier League football club Chelsea. He is one of the anchor shareholders of Lalique Group, with M\u00fcller Handels AG Schweiz, Dharampal Satyapal Limited, Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss and Claudio Denz, they hold 42.67% of Lalique Group shares. Wyss is a member of the Democracy Alliance, a club of liberal donors. In December 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives held a hearing on the threat of foreign interference in U.S. elections. While federal law prohibits foreign nationals from donating to political candidates, campaigns, or super PACs, there is a loophole allowing foreign nationals to finance ballot measures. The Sixteen Thirty Fund, largely funded by Wyss, has spent over $130 million on ballot measures in 25 states. In the 2024 election cycle alone, the group spent $37 million on ballot measures across the U.S. focused on topics like abortion and election law. After Ohio banned foreign spending on ballot campaigns, the Sixteen Thirty Fund abruptly stopped spending in the state. As a Swiss citizen, Wyss is legally prohibited from directly donating to U.S. political candidates or committees. Between 1990 and 2006, he donated $119,000 directly to candidates and political committees. The Federal Election Commission declined to take action against him, and the statute of limitations has passed. The Associated Press found that Wyss's \"influence is still broadly felt through millions of dollars routed through a network of nonprofit groups that invest heavily in the Democratic ecosystem. Such groups don't have to disclose the source of their funding \u2014 or many details about how they spend it.\" One vehicle for Wyss's political donations is the Berger Action Fund, which has donated $339 million to left-leaning nonprofits since 2016. The majority of the Berger Action Fund's $72 million expenditures in 2021 went to building public support for Joe Biden's agenda and thereby \"cementing Wyss' status as a Democratic-aligned megadonor.\"",

                "raw_content": "Key Takeaways * US average multifamily rent fell by $6 to $1,750, the largest September drop since 2009 and the worst monthly decline since late 2022. * A glut of new supply, particularly in high-growth Sun Belt markets, is intensifying leasing competition and pushing rents down. * While demand is softening, renting continues to outpace homeownership due to affordability issues in the for-sale market. A Cooling Market US multifamily advertised rents saw a notable $6 drop in September\u2014down to $1,750\u2014signaling potential softening after years of record-setting rent levels. According to Yardi Matrix, this marks the sharpest September rent decline since 2009 and the worst monthly performance since November 2022. The pullback is being driven by an influx of supply and waning economic momentum. Over 525,000 units are currently in lease-up nationally, with metros like Dallas, Phoenix, Austin, and Charlotte facing the greatest pressure due to high concentrations of new product. Rent Leaders and Laggards While national rent growth slowed to just 0.6% year-over-year, a handful of markets bucked the trend. New York (4.8%), Chicago (3.9%), and the Twin Cities (3.4%) posted the strongest annual rent gains. In contrast, high-supply markets saw the sharpest declines: Denver (-4.3%), Austin (-4.0%), and Phoenix (-3.3%). The Single-Family Build-to-Rent (BTR) segment also faltered, with average rents falling $15 to $2,194, the worst performance since 2015. Annual growth in the segment is now flat, with national BTR occupancy holding at 95.1%. Economic Drag and Demographic Shifts Labor market softening is adding to the multifamily sector\u2019s challenges. Unemployment ticked up to 4.3% in August with job creation slowing significantly. Consumer confidence is slipping, and more households report expectations of income declines, potentially hampering household formation. Long-term demographic shifts could further reshape demand. A Harvard study projects household growth to slow to 840,000 per year, down from 1.5M in the previous decade. However, the good news for multifamily is that a greater share of new households are expected to rent instead of buy. Why It Matters With affordability pushing more people into rentals, multifamily remains structurally supported. According to Harvard, roughly 2M renter households are expected to form over 2024 and 2025\u2014nearly double the long-term average. However, the current supply-demand imbalance is weighing on rents. Developers in high-supply metros are increasingly turning to concessions and price cuts to fill units. Until the lease-up backlog is absorbed, rent growth is likely to remain under pressure. What\u2019s Next The Federal Reserve\u2019s recent rate cut\u2014its first in nine months\u2014may offer some relief by improving financing conditions and potentially boosting consumer confidence. Meanwhile, tight for-sale market conditions could continue to bolster multifamily demand in the medium term. As the sector enters the final quarter of 2025, eyes are on whether a seasonal rebound materializes or if September\u2019s rent dip is the first sign of a broader slowdown.",

        "score": 10,
        "text_content": "Hey everyone! This is my first post here, so I'll cut right to the chase. A few months ago, shortly after HRM was first announced, I had an idea: \"What if you could combine the reasoning capabilities of HRM with the long-term memory of Titans?\" Well, fast-forward to today, and I have a working prototype architecture that can train, fine-tune, run inference (with baked-in quantization support), and even acquire new knowledge from the user! It can even re-quantize the updated model for you once you `ctrl + c` out of the chat window, along with `ctrl + x` to stop the model as it is generating text! But I've run into a major roadblock. So far, I've only been able to fine-tune on tiny datasets to verify that training loss goes down, LoRA merging works, memory updates function, etc.\u2014basically just testing the architecture itself. I'm a grocery store employee with motor cortex damage (I can't drive), which limits my income here in the States and, by extension, my access to hardware. I developed this entire project on an ASUS ROG Ally Z1 Extreme, which means I've only been able to train on small, 30-sample datasets. This is where I need your help. Would anyone in this community with access to CUDA-accelerated hardware be willing to train the first proper Chronos model on a larger dataset? If you can, that would be fucking awesome! I'm only targeting a 30M parameter model to start, with a `--context_dim` of 620 and both `--l_hidden` and `--h_hidden` set to 600. The architecture seems very efficient so far (in my tests, a 3M model hit a loss of 0.2 on a dummy dataset), so this should be a manageable size. The project is pretty flexible\u2014you can use any existing tokenizer from Hugging Face with the `--tokenizer-path` flag. It also supports Vulkan acceleration for inference right out of the box, though for now, it's limited to INT4, Q8\\_0, Q4\\_0, and Q2\\_K quantization types. Of course, whoever trains the first model will get full credit on the GitHub page and be added as a contributor! Below is the research paper I wrote for the project, along with the link to the GitHub repo. Thanks for reading! # Chronos: An Architectural Synthesis of Memory and Reasoning for Artificial General Intelligence # Abstract The dominant paradigm in artificial intelligence, predicated on scaling Transformer models, is encountering fundamental limitations in complex reasoning and lifelong learning. **I argue** that the path toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates a shift from a scale-first to an architecture-first philosophy. This paper introduces the **Chronos** architecture, a novel hybrid model that addresses the intertwined challenges of memory and reasoning. Chronos achieves a deep functional synthesis by integrating two seminal, brain-inspired systems: Google's **Titans architecture**, a substrate for dynamic, lifelong memory, and the **Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)**, a sample-efficient engine for deep, algorithmic thought. By embedding the HRM as the core computational module within the Titans memory workspace, Chronos is designed not merely to process information, but to think, learn, and remember in a cohesive, integrated manner. **I present** a complete reference implementation featuring a cross-platform C++ backend that validates this synthesis and provides robust tooling for training, fine-tuning, and high-performance quantized inference on a wide array of CPU and GPU hardware, demonstrating a tangible and technically grounded step toward AGI. # 1. Introduction: The Architectural Imperative The scaling hypothesis, while immensely successful, has revealed the inherent architectural weaknesses of the Transformer. Its computationally \"shallow\" nature results in brittleness on tasks requiring long chains of logical deduction, with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting serving as an inefficient and fragile workaround. **I posit** that the next leap in AI requires a deliberate synthesis of two pillars: a persistent, dynamic **memory** and a deep, sample-efficient **reasoning** engine. This paper proposes such a synthesis by merging the Titans architecture, which provides a solution for lifelong memory, with the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), which offers a blueprint for profound reasoning. The resulting **Chronos** architecture is a tangible plan for moving beyond the limitations of scale. # 2. Architectural Pillars # 2.1 The Titans Substrate: A Framework for Lifelong Memory The Titans architecture provides the cognitive substrate for Chronos, implementing a tripartite memory system modeled on human cognition: * **Short-Term Memory (Core):** The high-bandwidth \"working memory\" for processing immediate data. In **my** Chronos implementation, this is replaced by the more powerful HRM engine. * **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** A vast, neural, and associative repository that learns and updates **at test time**. It consolidates new knowledge based on a \"surprise metric,\" calculated as the gradient of the loss function (). This mechanism, equivalent to meta-learning, allows for continual, lifelong adaptation without catastrophic forgetting. * **Persistent Memory:** A repository for ingrained, stable skills and schemas, fixed during inference. Chronos leverages the most effective Titans variant, **Memory as Context (MAC)**, where retrieved memories are concatenated with the current input, empowering the core reasoning engine to actively consider relevant history in every computational step. # 2.2 The HRM Engine: A Process for Deep Reasoning The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) provides the cognitive process for Chronos, addressing the shallow computational depth of traditional models. Its power derives from a brain-inspired dual-module, recurrent system: * **High-Level Module (\"CEO\"):** A slow-timescale planner that decomposes problems and sets strategic context. * **Low-Level Module (\"Workers\"):** A fast-timescale engine that performs rapid, iterative computations to solve the sub-goals defined by the \"CEO\". This \"loops within loops\" process, termed **hierarchical convergence**, allows HRM to achieve profound computational depth within a single forward pass. It performs reasoning in a compact latent space, a far more efficient and robust method than unrolling thought into text. HRM's astonishing performance\u2014achieving near-perfect accuracy on complex reasoning tasks with only 27 million parameters and minimal training data\u2014is a testament to the power of architectural intelligence over brute-force scale. # 3. The Chronos Synthesis: Implementation and Capabilities The core architectural innovation of Chronos is the replacement of the standard attention \"Core\" in the Titans MAC framework with the entire Hierarchical Reasoning Model. The HRM becomes the central processing unit for thought, operating within the vast memory workspace provided by the LTM. An operational example, such as a medical diagnosis, would flow as follows: 1. **Ingestion:** New lab results enter the HRM's working memory. 2. **Strategic Retrieval:** The HRM's H-module formulates a query for \"past genomic data\" and dispatches it to the Titans LTM. 3. **Contextualization:** The LTM retrieves the relevant genomic data, which is concatenated with the new lab results, forming a complete problem space for the HRM. 4. **Hierarchical Reasoning:** The HRM executes a deep, multi-step reasoning process on the combined data to arrive at a diagnosis. 5. **Memory Consolidation:** The novel link between the patient's data and the new diagnosis triggers the \"surprise\" metric, and this new knowledge is consolidated back into the LTM's parameters for future use. This synthesis creates a virtuous cycle: **Titans gives HRM a world model**, and **HRM gives Titans a purposeful mind**. # 4. Implementation and Validation A complete Python-based implementation, [`chronos.py`](http://chronos.py/), has been developed to validate the Chronos architecture. It is supported by a high-performance C++ backend for quantization and inference, ensuring maximum performance on diverse hardware. # 4.1 High-Performance Cross-Platform Backend \ud83d\ude80 A key component of the Chronos implementation is its custom C++ kernel, `chronos_matmul`, inspired by the efficiency of `llama.cpp`. This backend is essential for enabling direct, zero-dequantization inference, a critical feature for deploying models on low-end hardware. The kernel is designed for broad compatibility and performance through a tiered compilation strategy managed by `CMake`. The build system automatically detects the most powerful Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) instruction sets available on the host machine, ensuring optimal performance for the target CPU architecture. The supported tiers are: * **x86-64 (AVX-512):** Provides the highest level of performance, targeting modern high-end desktop (HEDT) and server-grade CPUs from Intel and AMD. * **x86-64 (AVX2):** The most common performance tier, offering significant acceleration for the vast majority of modern desktop and laptop computers manufactured in the last decade. * **ARM64 (NEON):** Crucial for the mobile and edge computing ecosystem. This enables high-speed inference on a wide range of devices, including Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3), Microsoft Surface Pro X, Raspberry Pi 4+, and flagship Android devices. * **Generic Scalar Fallback:** For any CPU architecture not supporting the above SIMD extensions, the kernel defaults to a highly portable, standard C++ implementation. This guarantees universal compatibility, ensuring Chronos can run anywhere, albeit with reduced performance. In addition to CPU support, the backend includes **Vulkan** for GPU-accelerated inference. This allows the same quantized model to be executed on a wide array of GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel, making Chronos a truly cross-platform solution. # 4.2 Core Functional Capabilities The implementation successfully addresses all key functional requirements for a deployable and extensible AGI research platform. 1. **Built-in Training on JSON/JSONL:** The `JSONLDataset` class and `create_dataloader` function provide a robust data pipeline, capable of parsing both standard JSON lists and line-delimited JSONL files for training and fine-tuning. 2. **On-the-Fly Post-Training Quantization:** The `train` function includes a `--quantize-on-complete` command-line flag. When enabled, it seamlessly transitions from training to calling the `quantize` function on the newly created model, streamlining the workflow from research to deployment. 3. **Direct Inference on Quantized Models:** The system uses the C++ kernel `chronos_matmul` to perform matrix multiplication **directly on quantized weights** without a dequantization step. The `QuantizedChronos` class orchestrates this process, ensuring minimal memory footprint and maximum performance on low-end hardware. 4. **Flexible Test-Time Learning:** The `chat` mode implements two distinct mechanisms for saving LTM updates acquired during inference: * **Default Behavior (Direct Modification):** If no special flag is provided, the system tracks changes and prompts the user upon exit to save the modified LTM weights back into the base model file. * **LoRA-style Deltas:** When the `--ltm-lora-path` flag is specified, all LTM weight changes are accumulated in a separate tensor. Upon exit, only these deltas are saved to the specified `.pt` file, preserving the integrity of the original base model. 5. **Percentage-Based Fine-Tuning:** The `finetune` mode supports a `--finetune-unlock-percent` flag. This allows a user to specify a target percentage of trainable parameters (e.g., `1.5` for 1.5%). The script then automatically calculates the optimal LoRA rank (`r`) to approximate this target, offering an intuitive and powerful way to control model adaptation. 6. **Quantized Terminal Chat:** The `chat` mode is fully capable of loading and running inference on quantized `.npz` model files, providing an interactive terminal-based chat interface for low-resource environments. # 5. Conclusion and Future Work The Chronos architecture presents a compelling, cognitively inspired roadmap toward AGI. By prioritizing intelligent architecture over sheer scale, it achieves capabilities in reasoning and continual learning that are intractable for current models. The provided implementation validates the feasibility of this approach and serves as a powerful platform for further research. Future work will focus on the roadmap items I have outlined for the project: * Development of a user-friendly GUI. * Extension to multi-modal data types. * Implementation of the full training loop in Vulkan and CUDA for end-to-end GPU acceleration.

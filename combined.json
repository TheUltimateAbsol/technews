I love this game to death. > Marvel Rivals (NetEase, 2024) - EVERY SINGLE OTHER PLATFORM HAS THIS GAME, and I can\u2019t even imagine the hours I\u2019d clock on this on a Switch. > Lethal Company - I am aware that this game has not exited early access, but it\u2019d be a great use of those new microphone and camera features > SpyParty (Hecker & Cimino, 2018) - oddball pick, but it ran on the 360 and it feels very Nintendo-esque in its simplicity and nature, like a Wii Play minigame",

        "score": 133,
        "text_content": "Just yesterday, rumors began to emerge regarding a tentative synopsis floating around for the upcoming *Resident Evil* film being helmed by Zach Cregger, the filmmaker who wrote/directed *Barbarian* and whose horror-thriler film *Weapons* recently bowed in theaters last week. During the press junket for the latter film, Cregger already confirmed that his cinematic take on the Capcom franchise will feature an **entirely original narrative** set within the continuity of the games as opposed to adapting a pre-existing story, and now film review and news site JoBlo has scooped a rough summary of this potential plot, coupled with a tweet from Daniel Richtman (DanielRPK on Twitter) who has shared a potential logline for the film as well. Grain of salt as always. [JoBlo reported that the screenplay](https://www.joblo.com/resident-evil-logline/), which Cregger co-wrote with *John Wick Chapter 4* and *Ballerina* scribe Shay Hatten, centers on a **downtrodden courier tasked with delivering a package to a remote hospital**. While en route, he will supposedly **be drawn into the middle of a viral outbreak and be forced to fight hordes of mutated creatures**. Shortly thereafter,[ Richtman's alleged logline ](https://xcancel.com/DanielRPK/status/1956075290653868405)elaborated on this brief synopsis, claiming that this courier, who is expected to be played by [*Weapons'* Austin Abrams](https://deadline.com/2025/03/resident-evil-austin-abrams-zach-cregger-1236346563/), is named \"**Bryan**\"; he is coerced into discovering this outbreak by a \"**strange woman**\" he accidentally hits with his car while driving on a snowy mountain range. The creatures in question will supposedly comprise \"**tentacle-based mutations**\" and \"**bio-engineered monstrosities**\", which would be on brand for Umbrella Corp. shinanegans transpiring over the story. Again obviously, none of this is confirmed and people who follow film scoops should know about DanielRPK's particularly spotty track record with regards to general entertainment and industry info, but the viral outbreak backdrop and the activity of experimented creatures does track aesthetically with the games, and despite everyman protagonists being more prevalent in a series like *Silent Hill* overall, a character like Ethan Winters in the last two entries is an example of the games already having a precedent for having a primary point-of-view from a character that is seemingly drawn into conflict with no real combat experience like Jill, Leon, Claire, Ada or Chris. Obviously at present, Cregger is remaining tight-lipped on the nature of whatever story he has planned, but he has expressed the[ film's influence from cult horror classics like *Evil Dead II*](https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3892737/zach-cregger-compares-his-austin-abrams-led-resident-evil-movie-to-evil-dead-2/) and his desire to make a more kinetic, journey-driven film than the more methodical pacing of either *Barbarian* or *Weapons*. *Resident Evil* will be co-produced by Constantin Film and Sony Pictures through their PlayStation Productions label, and will be released theatrically on September 18, 2026.",

Decent sex robots won\u2019t come until robotics makes considerable improvements in more basic areas - likely as back-end restaurant workers, hotel cleaners, electricians, plumbers, and many other hands on, blue collar work.

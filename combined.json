So, token generation could be slower or not much different to current machines and I'm not too optimistic on it's prefill/prompt processing as DGX Spark will probably hold that crown till then (M5 could be a surprise in this category, I will say). But, from what I read it seems to be a DC product, to which I guess is more related to Rubin CPX? As in, cost effective, perf/watt, so no expensive HBM (though, CPX uses GDDR7) or maybe complicated packaging (so not comparing it to MI450 or Vera Rubin).

I think it has a lot of potential for things like local ML and Reinforcement Learning apps, which could bounce data between CPU and GPU [ simulation on CPU then Neural Network or rendering on GPU ] These kind of balanced CPU-GPU on a single package - such as Panther Lake and Strix Halo - might lead to new kinds of AI games, AI engineering apps, 3D in web browser etc. Fantastic win to have PantherLake on 18A also. OG devs like me grew up with Intel and AMD pushing the envelope every 6months .. we want Intel to survive and give us economic growth : now that Moores law has slowed down, that growth will come from many core and applied AI.",

Though the game isn't pretty in the slightest, it's hard not to enjoy everything this package has to offer. Sixth Axis - 10.0/100 >Unlike the most recent Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet & Violet, Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A is a game that really holds your attention. The spiritual successor to Legends Arceus, it's learned from the mistakes of the distant past and beautifully shows what city life is like in the Pok\u00e9mon universe. I can see myself playing this for another hundred hours as I finish my Pok\u00e9dex, shiny hunt and generally have a great time. This is easily the best Pok\u00e9mon game on the market. Shacknews - 9.0/100 >Pokemon Legends: Z-A gave me just about everything I wanted from a new Legends game. It continues the trend of bucking against series norms while maintaining the essence of what makes these games so special for fans. RPG Site - 9.0/100 >Years ago, I said that Pokemon Legends: Arceus proved that there was room in the Pokemon world for more games like Pokemon Colosseum to exist, and to even thrive. While Pokemon Legends: Z-A wasn't quite what I had in mind, it feels like validation nonetheless. Pokemon is at its best when Gamefreak is allowed to experiment with what a Pokemon game can actually be, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A is an affirmation that the series isn't done evolving, much like the Pokemon themselves. If this is the future of the series - more experimental \"Legends\" titles which attempt to broaden the Pokemon world in ways that only they can, instead of merely retreading old ground with remakes - I couldn't be happier. Siliconera - 9.0/100 >Pokemon Legends: Z-A is a follow-up to Arceus that feels both similar and different due to its focus on living alongside Pokemon in a modern city. The two themes are Mega Evolution and embracing life alongside Pokemon, and Game Freak and Nintendo are constantly showing and telling how that works. Admittedly, I miss the more varied biomes and locations from Arceus. But I do appreciate the story, the ambiance, the attention paid to characters, and how much it feels like a real city. After over 35 hours with it, I'm quite pleased. GamesRadar - 8.0/100 >Pokemon Legends: Z-A offers a true slice-of-life Pokemon experience thanks to its anime-style real-time combat system and wholesome worldbuilding elements. While its single-city setting can sometimes feel a bit samey, Lumiose is densely packed with things to do and discover. This is a world worth getting lost in. VG247 - 8.0/100 >Hopefully Game Freak will continue using the Legends series as a playground (maybe a return to pixel graphics, just a suggestion), but, for now, Lumiose City has been a treat to revisit. Nintendo Life - 7.0/100 >Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A should be celebrated for its fabulous real-time combat and its largely smooth jump to the Switch 2, but in condensing things down to one single location, it loses part of the Pok\u00e9mon magic that Arceus and many other entries managed to amplify. I'll forever find filling up my Pok\u00e9dex fun, and for the Switch 2 generation, this is a good starting point for the franchise. But if the Legends series is to continue, it needs to recapture its personality and fuse that real-time system with a bit more freedom. Eurogamer - 6.0/1.0 >Lumiose City could do with work, but Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A is a much more tightly focused - and delightfully goofy - return to better form. At least by modern Pok\u00e9mon's standards. IGN - TBD >I'm just so genuinely excited about what Game Freak has done here. \\[Review in Progress\\] # Videos [VGC - ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haH-EGFHlJM&pp=ygUbcG9rZW1vbiBsZWdlbmRzIHotYSByZXZpZXcg) 5/5 >Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A is a grand adventure that once again proves that the Legends series is home to the most interesting ideas Game Freak has. It's a game that understands its audience, and feels like a love letter to both players who grew up with X & Y, and those who've been here the whole time. The new battle system really worked for me, and the Rogue Mega Battles are bombastic fun, even if, like the traditional turn-based offering, it can get very easy as you level up your team. I hope the Pok\u00e9mon Legends series is here to stay.",

I even pre-planned my route so that I could speedrun to Liurnia of the Lakes as this is quite a graphically intensive area. All impressions below are from handheld mode. * The image quality of the game is exceptional. They are clearly targeting medium to high settings that looks closer to the current-gen versions of the game. The visuals exceeded PS4 and PC's low settings. * Visual features like draw distance, fog, and foliage density looked great. * The game isn't native-res and appears to be reconstructing its image from 720p-900p. Unfortunately, performance is still very shaky and more work needs to be done here. In the starting area (Precipice of Anticipation), the game runs quite poorly at around 15-20fps, likely due to the dust and fog in this area. Performance improves once we get to Limgrave with the game generally holding 25-30fps. It was quite striking at how the game just doesn't look downgraded in this area. Once I got Torrent, I rode to Liurnia of the Lakes to really test the game's performance. This area is very demanding as it features heavy water reflections, prominent fog, and panoramic vistas of the area. Performance did suffer in this area but I felt that the game was still playable at around 20-30fps. In this area, foliage pop-in was quite bad. Dense tufts of grass and foliage would pop-in literally right in front of me which was extremely distracting. The screen space reflections in the water are retained in this game but they render at quite a low resolution. The fog was also dense and matched the visual acuity seen on other platforms. --- I get the impression that they are prioritising visual appearance over performance with this port. As you've gathered by now, the game's graphics settings are quite high to the detriment of performance. The Low preset on Steam Deck generally averages 40fps so I am surprised that they didn't just put it on low settings and called it a day. There is still a lot of work to be done based on the version I played but it does seem like they are putting in the effort to create a bespoke Switch 2 version. It seems unlikely at this stage but a 40fps performance mode would be amazing!",

I take my Switch with me to work sometimes, and before I turned that setting off it'd be down below 50% several hours later when I had some down time.

We tried to keep it fair, with a solid analysis of all nominees. I also talked directly with most of these companies to make sure they\u2019re seriously working on biped capabilities, that was the main criterion this time. Feedback is always welcome.

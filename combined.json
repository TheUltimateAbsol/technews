Let's be honest, even if you could do all four jobs at once, it would be worth 200K a year, so no sane American will take it.

        "score": 18,
        "text_content": "Full article below. No BS link. # Key Takeaways * New-home sales jumped to an annual rate of 800,000 in August, topping economists' expectations, as buyers took advantage of lower mortgage rates and builder incentives. * Meanwhile, existing home sales declined slightly in August as prices remained high. * A recent decline in mortgage rates helped home sales, which economists said could be even better in September if rates continue to fall. New homes are now more popular than existing homes, due largely to builder incentives and plentiful inventory, new data released this week showed. Sales of newly-constructed homes in August came in at an annual rate of 800,000, a 20% increase from July\u2019s rate of 664,000. It was the fastest pace of sales since early 2022, economists at Wells Fargo noted in a report Wednesday. Economists said the surprisingly strong results are likely the result of builder incentives to lower housing costs and a decline in [mortgage rates](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-rates-5184598). \u201cThere\u2019s a large pool of Americans sitting on the sidelines who want to buy, and they are waiting for more affordability,\u201d said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \u201cThey are willing to buy when conditions are even a bit more favorable.\u201d # Why This Matters to Home Buyers The housing market has been mostly stuck due to high prices and limited inventory, but a rise in new-home sales shows that the market could be starting to turn around, especially if mortgage rates continue to decline. Mortgage rates have declined about three-quarters of a percentage point from the highs around 7% in January, according to Freddie Mac data. The latest [decline in borrowing costs](https://www.investopedia.com/homebuilders-need-more-rate-cuts-11813482) has come amid expectations the [Federal Reserve could continue to lower its benchmark interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/federal-reserve-september-meeting-interest-rate-decision-11811834). Even with the decline in mortgage rates, builders have been offering more incentives to move their inventory of new homes. In August, 66% of builders [offered special incentives](https://www.investopedia.com/how-are-home-builders-driving-sales-higher-price-cuts-and-rate-deals-8780972), the most in the post-Covid era, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Incentives include mortgage rate buy-downs, reduced closing costs and credits for housing design changes. Meanwhile, sales of existing homes have been sluggish\u2014sales fell slightly in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million\u2014as prices remain relatively high. The median sale price for an existing home was $422,600 last month, compared to the $413,500 price tag for the typical new home in August. Buyers also have more new houses to choose from, with data showing a 7.4 month supply of inventory of new houses, compared with a 4.6 month supply for existing homes. \u201cBuyers are seeing a lot of value in new homes and taking advantage of the unusually high glut of new homes for sale on the market,\u201d Long said. It could be just the start of improved sales in the housing market, economists said, as mortgage rates in September have continued the decline seen in August.",

                "raw_content": "Quick Summary * KB Home\u2019s third-quarter profit and full-year sales outlook declined because of a challenging housing market and lower home prices. * The average sales price for KB Home fell to $475,700 in the third quarter, down from $480,900 a year earlier. * Housing starts declined, with total starts down 6% and single-family starts down 12% year-over-year in August. KB Home recorded a lower third-quarter profit and cut its full-year outlook again as a wobbly housing market pushed down home prices. The home builder reduced its full-year sales guidance to $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion, down from its previous forecast of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion. The company had predicted full-year revenue as high as $7 billion to $7.5 billion in January. Home builders have suffered from stagnant sales as high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty have put off buyers. Many builders have been forced to offer aggressive concessions to stimulate sales, a move that has cut into their margins. Mortgage rates have fallen recently, but builders have said that hasn\u2019t led to higher sales activity. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen the uptick that we would expect to see from such a change in mortgage rates,\u201d KB Home Chief Operating Officer Robert McGibney said on the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cAnd I think to some extent, buyers are in maybe a bit of a wait-and-see mode.\u201d KB Home\u2019s average sales price fell to $475,700 in the third quarter, down from $480,900 a year earlier. The home-building industry is hopeful that the market might soon strengthen if mortgage rates continue to decline. The 30-year fixed rate fell to 6.26% last week, its lowest level since October, according to Freddie Mac. KB Home said the recent decline in mortgage rates, based on the company\u2019s average selling price, creates an additional $30,000 in purchasing power for buyers. But a weakening labor market has raised concerns that the housing market might remain stubbornly slow. Some builders have been pulling back on new starts to preserve margins while waiting for the downturn to end. Total housing starts in August declined 6% year-over-year, and single-family starts fell 12% in the same period, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released last week. KB Home\u2019s number of homes delivered fell 7% to 3,393 in the third quarter. Sales totaled $1.62 billion, down from $1.75 billion a year earlier. The company reported third-quarter net income of $109.8 million, or $1.61 a share, down from $157.3 million, or $2.04 a share. Analysts were expecting $1.50 a share, according to FactSet. KB Home said the decline in home starts is having the benefit of making construction less expensive. \u201cWe\u2019re using that as an opportunity to work with our trade partners and they\u2019re hungry for work, which gives us an opportunity to drive down costs,\u201d McGibney said. Lumber prices have also fallen in recent weeks, contributing to lower construction costs, KB Home said on the earnings call. Last week, Lennar, one of the largest U.S. home builders, reported a decline in third-quarter profit and said it would lower its building volume for the rest of the year to preserve its margins. It had previously adopted a strategy of pace over price, offering aggressive incentives, often in the form of mortgage buydowns, to maintain its sales volume, even at the expense of profit. **KB Home has advocated for price reductions instead of buydowns to encourage sales. It has argued that buydowns force customers to buy houses at inflated prices that they won\u2019t be able to match if they need to sell the home again.** **KB Home can avoid offering incentives because it builds more homes to order, while other companies build more of their homes on speculation, meaning they haven\u2019t yet found a buyer. Those spec homes are expensive for companies to keep on their balance sheet, forcing them to offer sizable incentives to offload the homes to buyers.** According to an August survey from John Burns Research and Consulting, builders are offering almost twice as much in incentives for spec homes as they are for built-to-order homes.",

Sorting trash into the appropriate bins is great ... But the slow, clunky, careful, awkward movement that we consistently see in all robots... that shit HAS to get improved upon. It's terrible, and it's what keeps robotics from being taken seriously. You can show me a super genius robot that can do anything, but if it does this slow, jerky shit, it'll never be more than an advance toy. In my opinion anyway. I have no doubt that it's going to be improved upon, and I have no doubt that it's a very difficult hurdle to jump over. But I've seen too many promo videos of robots that act like 102 year old men, or that have been sped up by 2x in order to make them look acceptable.",

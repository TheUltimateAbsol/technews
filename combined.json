The coldplate is heated from one side by the CPU, and cooled internally by heatpipes from finstack 1, *also* from the back side by the TEC. The TEC hot side is cooled by heatpipes from finstack 2. Airflow is first through finstack 1 then 2 in series. It seems to \"work\", although I wonder how it would compare to an otherwise-physically-identical cooler with no TEC and all 4 heatpipes in the coldplate. I've had shower thoughts about a similar idea for a TEC-boosted water loop, where coolant flow is radiator -> TEC cold -> CPU -> TEC hot. The theory being that the TEC would only be getting the water a little colder and not have to pass the full TDP of the CPU, plus if the TEC failed or was overwhelmed you could cut the power and it would gracefully degrade to a normal loop.",

But Honor went with Arrow Lake because: 1. **Lower cost** \u2013 Arrow Lake reuses Meteor Lake board design with minor tweaks; Lunar Lake would require a new board. 2. **Roadmap risk** \u2013 Intel has confirmed Lunar Lake has no successor. Investing in a one-off platform is too costly for Honor. So from an OEM perspective, Arrow Lake = safer, cheaper, less risky. # My Verdict Lmao, another classic Honor moment \u2014 basically copying Huawei. The Huawei MateBook Pro X was one of the best Windows ultrabooks in 2024, but with U.S. sanctions cutting off future models, Honor clearly wants to capture that displaced buyer base. Arrow Lake does bring big efficiency gains over Meteor Lake, but this chassis is objectively a step down from Huawei\u2019s 2024 effort \u2014 Huawei managed to stuff a **larger 70Wh battery at a lighter weight** with even better build quality. Still, given the current ultrabook landscape, Honor did produce a solid contender: * AR-coated OLED feels more comfortable than the sea of PWM-heavy Samsung OLEDs elsewhere * The design is sleeker and more modern compared to Lenovo ThinkBook/ThinkPad at similar price points, which stick to a more rigid \u201cclassic business\u201d aesthetic If you want something that looks and feels closer to a MacBook but runs Windows, the MagicBook Art 14 (2025) is definitely worth a look \u2014 just don\u2019t expect gaming performance or marathon battery life.",

        "score": 69,
        "text_content": "NPN, which were previously the first outlet to report on both the castings of both [Cody Rhodes as Guile](https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-cody-rhodes-to-portray-guile-street-fighter) and [50 Cent as Balrog](https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-curtis-jackson-is-in-talks-to-portray-balrog-in-street-fighter), have now reported that comedian [Eric Andre is also now slated to join](https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-eric-andre-joins-the-cast-of-street-fighter) the growing ensemble of Legendary's upcoming *Street Fighter* film. [This was actually first alleged by Jeff Sneider](https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2025/6/26/street-fighter-reboot-is-casting-like-it-lost-a-bet-andrew-schulz-50-cent-jason-momoa-orville-peck) back in June when other leads in the cast were being finalized around the same time, but now the character Andre is playing, previously rumored to be an announcer for the World Warrior tournament that sets the film, has been deemed highly likely to be **Don Sauvage**. This is actually a pull directly from more recent entries, as Sauvage originates as an NPC in *Street Fighter V* who appears in both the full story campaign to hype up the tag-team match between Zangief/R. Mika and Laura/Alex, as well as Zangief's arcade mode route as an announcer for the [Capcom Wrestling Association](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Capcom_Wrestling_Association), an in-universe WWE-stand in that actually has its origins in the fighting game [*Saturday Night Slam Masters*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Slam_Masters), which alongside beat-em-up franchise *Final Fight*, exists in the same continuity as the *Street Fighter* series. This is notable on two fronts, being that it's a character that featured in an entry outside either any of the *Street Fighter II*'s or *Street Fighter Alpha*, which virtually the entire character lineup has comprised at this point, and it also leaves open the possibility for allusions and possible characters who could establish links between *Street Fighter* and other Capcom fighting games as is the case in games going up to as recently as *Street Fighter 6*, which featured the Mad Gear Gang from *Final Fight* as antagonists in World Tour. Considering Legendary using their *Godzilla* reboot to launch its own shared universe with King Kong [as a homage to their prior crossover in 1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_vs._Godzilla), it would not surprise me if they're already weighing the option of using *SF* as a starting point to a similar multi-film plan that connects it with other Capcom fighting games, as the precedent is already there in the source material. In tangentially related rumors, [the Hollywood newsletter Puck](https://puck.news/newsletter_content/what-im-hearing-new-pars-franchise-play-creggers-horror-show/) has also scooped that the *Street Fighter* film production/distribution rights are slated to be snatched up by Paramount Pictures [pending their recently escalated negotiations](https://deadline.com/2025/08/paramount-legendary-deal-1236490935/) with Legendary for a multi-picture deal, which also includes a streaming exclusivity window on Paramount+ for unspecified upcoming releases. The film, which is currently shooting in Australia, is currently being handled at Sony Pictures. Legendary has not commented on any of the above.",

        "text_content": "Highlights: According to a new IFS/YouGov survey, 25% of young adults believe that AI has the potential to replace real-life romantic relationships. Heavy porn users are the most open to romantic relationships with AI of any group and are also the most open to AI friendships in general, per a new IFS research brief. About half of young adults under age 40 (55%) view AI technology as either threatening or concerning, while 45% view it as either intriguing or exciting. Conclusion In sum, these survey findings suggest that even though the majority of Gen Zers and Millennials are not yet comfortable with the prospect of an AI friend or romantic partner, a much higher share (25%) believe that AI could replace real-life romantic relationships in the future. There is also a significant share of the population that is unsure; meaning, we might just be seeing the beginning of a much larger social phenomenon. Young adults who spend more time online in their spare time are more likely to be open to AI companions in general. Further, young adults who are heavy porn users are the group most open to the idea of having an AI girlfriend or boyfriend\u2014as well as an AI friendship. Young women are much more likely than young men to perceive AI as a threat (28% vs. 23%) and are less likely to be excited about AI\u2019s effect on society (11% vs. 20%). There is an apparent class divide in how young adults view the future effect of AI on society. Young adults with lower incomes and less education are more likely to see AI technology as a destructive force in society. However, when it comes to the idea of having an AI romance, these young adults are more open to the idea than those with college education or higher income. That 1% of American young adults in the survey report having an AI friend is significant because it marks the beginning of profound change in how we relate to one another: from a world where humans connect and form romantic bonds with each other to a world in which humans engage romantically with machines. The greater openness to AI relationships among those with a pornography addiction may strike some readers as obvious, if not telling. But the complex reaction to AI among lower-income Americans certainly raises important and pressing questions. Is it related to the decline of marriage among lower-income and less educated Americans, who might feel forced to be more open to AI romance but also naturally fear the consequences? Could this further the class divide in marriage and family life, in which romantic relationships between humans and robots will be stratified by income? These are necessary questions for further study and exploration.",

LLMs don't seem to be the route to AGI, and they're not particularly useful, for taking in BILLIONS of funding for a product that won't be nearly as profitable. it'd be like shouting people pointing out a housing bubble issue are 'stupid' because of course people will still need houses, or something. that idea doesn't really matter to the actual thing being talked about. and you sure as fuck shouldn't just shout down any possible discussion that isn't 'shit's going to be amazing' discussions. as if they were betrayals of the idea.",

I\u2019m not here to argue otherwise. OpenAI has been releasing new models at such a relentless pace \u2014 the powerful o3 model came out four months ago \u2014 that it has cannibalized the shock we might have felt if there had been nothing between the 2023 release of GPT-4 and the 2025 release of GPT-5. But GPT-5, at least for me, has been a leap in what it feels like to use an A.I. model. It reminds me of setting up thumbprint recognition on an iPhone: You keep lifting your thumb on and off the sensor, watching a bit more of the image fill in each time, until finally, with one last touch, you have a full thumbprint. GPT-5 feels like a thumbprint.\"",

This endangers various marine species, and monitoring those changes is vitally important. But it can be challenging to reach the deepest waters without the aid of very expensive equipment. Moon jellyfish can swim to those depths, however, making them a potential ally in the quest to study the deep ocean. That's why researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder) have built \"cyborg\" jellyfish equipped with tiny microelectronics devices, with the aim of gathering critical data on temperature, acidity, and other relevant properties. To further improve their hybrid creations, the team has been studying the biomechanics of how jellyfish swim. Their research also involves analyzing water flow patterns generated by swimming jellies using suspended starchy biodegradable particles, described in the group's most recent [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/bg66-976x) published in the journal Physical Review Fluids.\"",

        "score": 291,
        "text_content": "The Chinese hardware reviewer released a video revealing that mobile phone manufacturers have cheated in gaming performance reviews of their phones by doing a few things: 1. Sending specially selected review units which contain \"Golden\" chips to reviewers. These chips are able to achieve higher gaming performance (6-8%) and lower power usage than the average retail unit, usually a watt lower (20%). 2. Certain review models from Xiaomi force VRS (Variable Rate Shading) on out-of-box to boost gaming benchmarks with no option to turn it off. 3. iPhones are one of the few models with no observable cheating. iPhone retail units in fact performed better than review units in gaming due to operating system updates. The video in question has been wiped from all Chinese media platforms, including from cloud storages and backups done by other people. Other content creators reacting to the incident had their react videos taken offline by the platforms too. It is very likely that a state level censorship is underway to protect Chinese phone manufacturers. The video on Geekerwan's youtube channel has been set to private, possibly under pressure from powers from above. He has given permission to anyone who would like to backup or share the video in question. Source explaining the situation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfPgQL5RvjU Backup of the censored video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrUNXofYAfY (backup of the video and youtube comments)",

                "raw_content": "Alternatively it's because just like YouTube, Chinese companies also file malicious take down notices and bogus lawsuits. Geekerwan's own Weibo post suggests that this isn't state censorship but rather companies filing take down notices and lawsuits. If a government censor doesn't want him talking about it they would've scrubbed it from the internet and banned him from being able to post a link on Weibo. The fact that none of his accounts were even taken down and discussions weren't banned on Weibo makes it extremely unlikely to be gober ment censorship. EDIT: You can still go and search his name (\u6781\u5ba2\u6e7e) on Weibo, and see what other people are saying. Normally when it's government censors doing it, they would block people from searching the terms and remove all posts around it. Also [posts with screenshots](https://weibo.com/7691041696/5269790321279910) are still up. It's just the video being taken down right now. EDIT 2: I see rumours that manufacturers filed a complaint with the Chinese state regulator which got the video taken down. There's a screenshot floating around that claims the Cyberspace Administration of China took the video down, but it's fake and edited from an actual govt announcement. EDIT 3: Incredibly, the video seems to still be up on mihoyo forums https://www.miyoushe.com/sr/article/73501822",

There's nothing worst for a device manufacturer than year-over-year fluctuating component costs. Bespoke OEMs like Frameworks who sell at low volume are especially susceptible to this. Apple is probably betting on the RAM price increasing more than the premium they'd pay Samsung so with their long-term contract, they'd end up ahead. Plus, it'll likely give Apple a priority access versus OEMs who buy on shorter or spot market contracts (including Samsung Mobile).",

This, quite obviously, leads to more conservative outlooks and practices since it's, yaknow... literal banks and insurers holding stock lol. There's been increasing pressure for Japanese companies to move away from this practice for the sake of 1.) regaining more institutional control and 2.) optimizing investment paths for overseas shareholders, just as Toyota has done recently. Nintendo is effectively doing a buyback, and could *potentially* signal making shares more appealing for ex-US holdings. It can also be seen as a hedge against their stock dropping back to 2024 levels partly due to how crushed the yen has been in the past few years. TL;DR - If you're an overseas investor in Nintendo, not a bad sign. If you're not an investor, this means a shitload of fuck.",

As they, you know, move to multi-platform, as they begin to sort of degrade what it means to have a PlayStation. Because they're responding to that same force that we're talking about, that same maybe inevitable pressure of, you know, consoles are just kind of going away and it's becoming a multi-platform world. What do you do with that when having Uncharted be PlayStation exclusive used to be so important? So you can see some of those pressures kind of being applied to Sony. But yeah, it does seem as though they kind of made a few less bad decisions or just kind of bungle things up quite a bit less. They kind of kept things simpler, I guess, over the course of the 2010s than Microsoft. >Jason Schreier: I mean, I think for them, their strategy is like, live service games are coming at PC, but I think, the sense of getting is that they're backing away from putting their exclusive consoles stuff, like traditional single player stuff, on PC. >Kirk Hamilton: Really? You think they can close that door? As if they could start to say, okay, never mind, Ghost of Tsushima 3 is only going to be on PlayStation. >Jason Schreier: I do. >Maddy Myers: Wow. >Jason Schreier: I do. Yeah. >Maddy Myers: Hmm. Called shot. >Jason Schreier: And I mean, even if they don't, I mean, we're seeing, like Wolverine is coming in September, they just announced it's coming September 15th. That's not going to be on PC, that's going to be on PlayStation 5 only. >Kirk Hamilton: You think that'll never come to PC? >Jason Schreier: I wouldn't be surprised if it never came to PC. But even if it does, like, again, it's just like, you have a very strong idea of what that is and you need a PlayStation to play it, at least for the, like, indefinite future. And so there is a strong brand behind it. John Linneman source: [www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnZsurPI5EY&t=1413s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnZsurPI5EY&t=1413s) >Richard Leadbetter: What do you think, John? Do you think there is actually I mean, if they're going to fully embrace PC, they've got to fully embrace PC, and that means a lot of things that I don't think they want to do. For example, day and date releases. >John Linneman: Yep. I actually I have an inkling that they're pulling away from PC. Watch the space. But I can't help based on some of the decisions and the way things have been going lately, I get the feeling that under the current leadership, that PC has become less important. One might argue that the Jim Ryan era, the one positive thing to come out of it is this shift to PC, but I'm not confident that they have like a huge vision for PC going forward. Not to say that we won't still see some PC games happening, but I think it's not going to become more PC focused. I think if anything, it's going to become less. We'll see. I mean, maybe that's not the case at all, but and this is the reason I don't think that they are they would ever consider like saying like a PC launcher, like going bigger on PC at the expense of console. I think console is where they want to be. It is important to note that both are speculating, but I would say it is noteworthy that both did it in the same week. Maybe there are some decisions being made behind the scenes at PlayStation that lead to that simultaneous speculation. Especially Scheier's comments are interesting, given he has more insight into the industry than most.",

        "score": 16,
        "text_content": "> Earlier in the year, Samsung's foundry business reportedly attracted a new set of orders from important clients. Instead of the \"still in-progress\" cutting-edge 2 nm GAA node process (aka SF2), key customers selected more mature production lines: 5 nm and 8 nm. Approximately seven months later, Intel is reportedly on Samsung Foundry's production order books, with semiconductor industry insiders disclosing details of a major deal. According to a two-day-old Hankyung news article, a next-gen Platform Controller Hub (PCH) design has been linked to a \"legacy-grade\" 8-nanometer node. Inside trackers reckon that Team Blue's futuristic mainboard chipset is heading towards mass production, with a \"full-scale\" phase anticipated next year. > > Speculation points to the eventual arrival of 900-series chipsets; destined to control \"Nova Lake\" desktop processors. In theory, a flagship variant\u2014perhaps \"Z990\"\u2014could be the first of Intel's 8 nm PCH products to reach retail by late 2026. Currently, the foundry service's Taylor, Texas-based facility\u2014aka Samsung Austin Semiconductor\u2014produces a selection of current-gen 14 nm chipsets for Team Blue. Back in South Korea, the Hwaseong 8 nm production line can pump out about 30,000 to 40,000 wafers per month. It is possible that Intel has favored Samsung's native operation due to a high level of node maturity and operational reliability. Isn\u2019t the fact that Intel doesn\u2019t manufacture these themselves - on a very mature 10 nm class node, which they should have plenty of - very alarming?",

Its customized chassis and backplate feature Black Ops 7 elements and iconography, including the Black Ops 7 icon and orange accents in signature Black Ops style. Inside is the venerable Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU with the latest RDNA 4 architecture from AMD, 16GB of VRAM, the HYPR-RX feature set and a super-resolution mode that leverages machine learning. **Phase-Change Thermal Pads Provide a Long-Lasting Cooling Experience** When transferring heat, the electrically non-conductive pad is a solid at room temperature but liquifies as it heats up. As it melts, it fills the microscopic gaps between the GPU and thermal module, providing superior thermal conductivity and enhanced heat dissipation, ensuring optimal performance, even for sustained, heavy GPU workloads. Additionally, the phase-change thermal pads offer exceptional longevity. They outlast traditional pastes by a significant margin, even for graphics cards that see heavy workloads on a regular basis. **ASUS GPU Tweak III Software** \\- Some gamers prefer to tune their graphics cards for all-out performance, while others insist on quiet operation. A physical Dual BIOS switch lets users choose between performance and quiet modes without installing additional software. For more performance-tuning options, easy hardware monitoring and granular control of fan behavior, users can download the free ASUS GPU Tweak III software. **ASUS GPU Guard & Bracket** \\- ASUS GPU Guard applies adhesive to secure all four corners to reduce the risk of cracks, while a GPU bracket helps ensure uniform mounting pressure and extra stability. **Protective PCB Coating** \\- A protective conformal coating envelops the circuit board to help protect against short-circuits caused by moisture, dust or debris. * 3.125-slot design with a vented exoskeleton and massive fin array optimized for airflow from three Axial-tech fans * Three eleven-blade Axial-tech fans maintain a steady high-pressure stream of cooling through a massive airflow-optimized fin array. * Dual-ball fan bearings last up to twice as long as conventional sleeve-bearing designs. * 0dB technology allows the fans to turn off at low workloads and effectively become silent. * Dual BIOS switch to toggle between Performance and Quiet BIOS profiles. * Subtle RGB lighting on the TUF Gaming logo on the corner of the card can be configured through Aura Sync What do you think about this collab and the card design?

            {
                "raw_content": "House hunters are retreating amid high housing costs and a seasonal slowdown, leading prospective sellers to pull back, too. U.S. pending home sales fell 5.8% from a year earlier during the four weeks ending December 14, the biggest decline since the start of 2025. On a metro level, pending sales declined in all but six of the 50 most populous U.S. metro areas, with the biggest drops in San Jose, CA (-35.1% year over year), Houston (-20.9%), and Oakland, CA (-17.6%). The typical U.S. home that does sell is taking 52 days to go under contract, about a week longer than last year. House hunters are hesitant this holiday season because mortgage rates are stubbornly sitting above 6%, and home-sale prices are rising, putting homes out of reach for many would-be buyers. Additionally, many prospective buyers are waiting for clearer signals on the economy before they make a major purchase; some are concerned about job security amid signals of weakness in the labor market. Another reason pending sales are declining year over year: Sales increased around this time last year after the uncertainty leading up to the 2024 presidential election had passed. Slow homebuying demand is pushing would-be sellers to the sidelines, too. New listings are down 3.1% year over year, the biggest decline in more than two years. The total number of homes for sale is up just 4.2%, the smallest increase since the start of 2024. Many prospective sellers are reluctant to list their home while the market is tilting toward buyers, with some waiting until the new year to see if demand improves. \u201cMortgage rates are buyers\u2019 biggest concern. They want to make sure they\u2019re not paying too much every month,\u201d said Tracy Edwards, a Redfin Premier agent in Raleigh, NC. \u201cMy advice to sellers is to carefully consider the buyer\u2019s perspective: If a buyer is taking on a high monthly payment, they want the house to be near perfect and the sale price to be fair. Be open to negotiations around repairs and seller concessions, and be realistic about the asking price. It\u2019s better to sell a home quickly than let it linger on the market.\u201d",

        "score": 24,
        "text_content": "Latest housing market data shows that new home listings in the U.S. fell about 1.7 percent from a year ago, marking the largest drop in more than two years. At the same time, pending home sales also declined, and homes that do go under contract are taking longer to sell. This suggests both buyers and sellers are hesitant heading into the end of 2025. From an investor or buyer perspective, a few points stand out: Supply is tightening, even as demand is lukewarm, which helps support prices. Many sellers may be waiting for a clearer market before listing, especially with economic uncertainty and mortgage rates still above 6 percent in many areas. Homes that do sell are taking more time to move, meaning buyers may have more negotiating room if they are patient. All of this points to a market where buyers are cautious and sellers are holding back, creating a sort of stalemate that could keep prices more stable than dropping sharply. For those watching 2026 trends, this kind of data might mean key housing themes will be pricing stability, selective demand, and slow listing activity rather than a big crash or surge. Anyone seeing this pattern where you live?",

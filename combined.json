AI chips require maximum performance and as low power consumption as possible due to shortage of electricity going to data centers. The world is insatiable for cutting edge nodes due to AI. And here comes China eroding GF's 7nm and above market. Both GF and UMC are in a tough spot.

        "text_content": "This is just a (small) PSA: please don't support slimeball hardware related publications / journalists / YouTubers. Recently I broke first here that Nvidia was going to drop support for Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/nvidia\\_is\\_ending\\_support\\_for\\_maxwell\\_pascal\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/nvidia_is_ending_support_for_maxwell_pascal_and/) This was just a little over two hours(according to the Nvidia developer forum date indicator) after Nvidia made the announcement. I noticed it while reading the Linux GPU driver forum completely by chance. A few hours later, VideoCardz published an article here: [https://archive.is/I4x4f#selection-1537.27-1537.35](https://archive.is/I4x4f#selection-1537.27-1537.35) You may be asking: \"So? Anyone could have found that post. It's a public forum!\". Unfortunately, it's *crystal clear* that they originally gotten the information from my post: 1. Conflicting, nonsensical information: In their article they state: >NVIDIA has officially confirmed that the next major driver branch (580) will be the last to support three GPU architectures, affecting several GeForce and professional products. >Starting with version 580 (currently at 576.80), NVIDIA will no longer support Maxwell-based cards (GeForce GTX 700, GTX 900) and Pascal-based GTX 10 series. The list also includes the TITAN V, a limited release and the only consumer-oriented GPU based on the Volta architecture. The first sentence conflicts with the first. The 580 driver cannot both support the 580 driver(first sentence) and not(second two sentences). This is presumably because of my title, which I admitted was a mistake here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/comment/n0otxx1/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/comment/n0otxx1/?context=3) To be crystal clear, the 580 series will be the last driver branch to support those generations. It was my mistake. The point is, this makes zero sense and is garbage journalism. 2. Repeating questions / answers asked/answered in my Reddit thread: >While the update refers to UNIX systems, the driver branches are shared across both Windows and UNIX-based platforms. First off, who normally refers to Linux support as Unix? Yes Nvidia technically supports BSD but no one really cares(sorry BSD people). Anyway, this is clearly information from this exchange: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/comment/n0ou3j3/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/comment/n0ou3j3/?context=3) It's bad enough to regurgitate what other people have said and pass it off as if you said it, but it's especially bad when you don't know what you're copy/pasting and it comes from places like *Reddit*. EDIT: 3. No additional information Thanks to /u/[hackenclaw](https://www.reddit.com/user/hackenclaw/) for making me think of this, but the lack of curiosity as to why all 3 generations are getting deprecated it itself eye-brow raising. If they knew anything, they would have known that Nvidia is deprecating support in order to align with GPUs that support the \"GPU System Processor\"(GSP) and included it in their article. You can read more here: [https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/19](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/19) ... I could care less about fake internet points(it's Reddit, lmao). The point of this post is to bring awareness to crappy journalism vomited out in order to drive site traffic. The opinions and information they vomit out is not theirs and it doesn't even make sense. You just know that B-tier normally rumor-mill YouTubers who make clickbait thumbnails and titles are going to cover this and they're going to use the trashy VideoCardz article. Please, if you're reading this, don't support this bad journalism from any publication or YouTuber.",

        "score": 251,
        "text_content": "Hello, TL:DR, Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Ninja Theory probably cost approximately \u00a390.3 million and subsequent investment into Ninja Theory amounted to \u00a392.2 million. Total revenue during this period amounted to approximately \u00a323 million. Ninja Theory\u2019s accounts are publicly available at the UK government\u2019s Companies House service. https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/05240956 I have investigated these accounts and my findings are as below: - Within the Full Accounts up to 30 June 2019, Ninja Theory\u2019s report a sale of IP to Microsoft at a value of \u00a390.3 million (interpreted as the cost of acquiring the studio itself). - Subsequent inter company income from Microsoft amounts to \u00a390.2 million during the time frame. Combined with the gain on sale of IP and the total is \u00a3182.5 million. - Revenue during the time frame amounts to \u00a330 million (not including intercompany income). Item | One time cost | Intercompany income | Revenue | Net ---|---|----|----|---- Sale of IP | 90.3 | N/A | N/A | -90.3 June 2019 | N/A | 20.1 | 12.7 | -7.4 June 2020 | N/A | 16.1 | 5 | -11.1 June 2021 | N/A | 14.2 | 2.4 | -11.8 June 2022 | N/A | 19 | 1.6 | -17.4 June 2023 | N/A | 22.8 | 1.2 | -21.6 Total | -90.3 | -92.2 | 22.9 | -159.6 * Revenue includes contract income (likely from their mocap studio and other projects) as well as their self-published income (presumably Hellblade I and previous projects). NOTES: - **I AM NOT AN ACCOUNTANT, THIS POST IS CRUDE, RUDIMENTARY AND AMATEUR** - Doesn\u2019t include the last 2 years, which would include the last year of intercompany income to fund the last year of Hellblade II development. - This presumably does not take into account revenue to Microsoft via other means (GamePass for example). - That said, I think this is all in all, a reasonable estimate for the cost of Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Ninja Theory. The last two years of Ninja Theory have likely also cost a further \u00a340 million based upon the trend but that is not taken into account. Thank you, if anything in this post is wrong or I am misinformed in anyway, please feel free to call me out on it.",

The game launched as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2020 for iOS and macOS devices, before being ported to Nintendo Switch and PC (it's actually [on sale on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1570020/Worlds_End_Club/) right now if you're interested) the following year. The PS5 version has not been officially announced by publisher IzanagiGames as of yet. The game is a hybrid of side-scrolling puzzle-platformer and narrative adventure. Other than that the plot setup is basically *Danganronpa* with a crazed clown instead of sadistic bear. It's decent, the game's actually pretty visually stimulating with the comic book-esque art style, but it's honestly not the best post-Chunsoft game Kodaka's done so far, especially in terms of design and structure (Hundred Line is really good).",

Below we have linked the support pages for the most common brands and manufacturers that sell AMD graphics cards, motherboards and systems. --- [XFX Support](https://www.xfxforce.com/support/contact-us) [SAPPHIRE Customer Service](https://support.sapphiretech.com/Default.asp?lang=eng) [PowerColor Service Support](https://www.powercolor.com/contact) [MSI Service And Support](https://www.msi.com/support) [Gigabyte Support Services Center](https://www.gigabyte.com/Support) [ASRock Support](https://www.asrock.com/support/) [ASUS Support](https://www.asus.com/support/) [Dell/Alienware Support](https://www.dell.com/support/home/) [HP Customer Support](https://support.hp.com/) [Lenovo Technical Support](https://support.lenovo.com/) [ACER Support](https://www.acer.com/support) --- # READ BEFORE POSTING \u2014 READ BEFORE POSTING \u2014 READ BEFORE POSTING If you are experiencing any issues, including, but not limited to; games or programs crashing, system crashes, hangs, blue screens of death (BSoD), driver timeouts, system not starting, system freezes, data corruption, system shutting down unexpectedly, visual artifacts, lower than expected performance or any other issue, **please read and try the following before making a post** \u2014 the majority of problems can be resolved by trying the steps listed below. The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order, if a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step. * If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet. * If you have any power related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB and 3.3V rails) can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose. * Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual. * If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers or buttons you can use, please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS. * If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on. * Make your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have \u2014 most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which will allow you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB. * If you are using an AMD Radeon RX 6000, RX 7000, RX 9000 or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30, RTX 40 or RTX 50 GPU, please ensure you are using separate 6 - 8pin PCIe cables or dedicated 12VHPWR/12V-2x6 cables and not using daisy-chained or splitter cables, as these may not be able to supply adequate power to the GPU \u2014 some cards may have LED indicators by the connector to let you know if the GPU isn't receiving enough power. Please consult your GPU and PSU manual for information on how to correctly connect your GPU. * Make sure your Monitor or TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor or TV and if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters or splitters, remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables. * Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games and applications. * Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs and other performance, security, stability and compatibility issues. * Make sure you are running the latest [AMD Chipset or Graphics Drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html). Some devices, such as laptops and handhelds may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturer's support page. * If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using the [AMD Cleanup Utility](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/GPU-601.html) or [Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit) * If you have installed GPU drivers after using the AMD Cleanup Utility or DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again. * If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like [here](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)) please [view the following thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1hdjxba/guide_how_to_resolve_windows_update_installing/) on the steps you can take to resolve and prevent this happening in future. * If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues \u2014 more information on disabling MPO is available in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling_multiplane_overlay_mpo_fixed_all/). * If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through [Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB), [Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_EpicGamesStore/c-EpicGamesStore_LauncherSupport/how-do-i-verify-game-files-in-the-epic-games-launcher-a000084923#:~:text=Find%20the%20game%20in%20your,Click%20the%20Verify%20button), [Ubisoft Connect](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/verifying-game-files-in-ubisoft-connect-pc/000060529), [EA App](https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Services-General-Questions/How-to-verify-game-files-of-installed-games/m-p/6578960), [GOG Galaxy](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003930017-My-game-data-is-corrupt-How-can-I-repair-my-game), [Battle.net](https://battle.net/support/article/7655) or whichever game client you are using. * If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller. * If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values, this can be checked under Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options. * Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability. * If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP \u2014 to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings \u2014 this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner or Ryzen Master, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities as well. * If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available here * If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the *below PSU calculators* and make sure the PSU you have (or intend to buy) can supply enough power when your system is under full load \u2014 If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load. * PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html) \u2014 [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/) \u2014 [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator) \u2014 [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/) \u2014 [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator) \u2014 [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator) \u2014 You can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage. * Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc... * If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdown or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Remember that **just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable** and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system \u2014 many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it. --- [OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/occt/personal) \u2014 OCCT is the only comprehensive stability testing software available. 20 years of experience have proved OCCT to be the community's software of choice in terms of stability and performance testing.

        "text_content": "I\u2019ve been tracking this market like a hawk. Prices, inventory, income ratios, builder sentiment, delinquencies, and I\u2019ll just say it: 2025 looks *worse* than 2006 by most metrics. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what I\u2019m seeing that nobody on CNBC wants to talk about: # Affordability is completely broken * Median home price is now $356,000. Back in 2000? [It was $119K.](https://www.fixr.com/articles/single-family-home-affordability) * But incomes didn\u2019t even come close to keeping up. It's up just 40% since 2000. * In CA, you now need **$234K/year** to afford a [median home.](https://lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/Article/Detail/793) * Nationally, monthly housing costs are averaging **$2,412**, which is **35% of income** for the *average* buyer. * That\u2019s *insane*. The historical cap for sustainable affordability has always been \\~30%. People aren\u2019t just stretched...they\u2019re drowning. Especially if they bought in the last 12 months. # Inventory is spiking\u2026 and so are price cuts This is one of the clearest red flags right now: * Active inventory is up 31.5% YoY, now over 1 million listings**.** First time [since 2019](https://www.realtor.com/research/may-2025-data/) * 1 in 5 homes listed in May had a price cut. That\u2019s the highest ever tracked * In Arizona and Texas, we\u2019re seeing 35\u201337% price cut rates It\u2019s not that people *don\u2019t* want to buy. They just *can\u2019t* at these prices with 6.8% mortgage rates. # Sunbelt is leading the crash The pandemic darlings are crumbling first: * Austin has [91% more](https://jbrec.com/insights/supply-demand-shapes-regional-housing-trends-2025/) homes for sale than in 2019, prices falling * Florida home values are actually down YoY * Tampa and Charlotte are overloaded with new construction and underwater flippers Compare that to places like Boston or NYC? Inventory is still tight. But those markets didn\u2019t balloon as hard post-COVID. # Builders are slamming the brakes Developer sentiment is collapsing: * Builder confidence dropped to 32 on the HMI\u2014third lowest since 2012 * Housing starts are down 9.8% * There are now 285,000 more homes being completed than started Translation: builders are finishing what they started, then getting the hell out of the way. # Mortgage market is flashing warnings * 30-year rates are hovering around 6.85% * VA loan foreclosure rate is the highest since 2019 * Total household debt hit $18.2 TRILLION in Q1 * Mortgage delinquencies just ticked up again We\u2019re not in 2008 subprime territory, but the cracks are showing. Especially for maxed-out DTI borrowers in bubble markets. # This is a bubble\u2026just a different flavor than 2008 * Lending is cleaner (better credit scores, real down payments) * But affordability is worse * Inventory is rising * Buyer demand is collapsing in key regions * And the Fed isn\u2019t cutting anytime soon People keep asking *\u201cwhere\u2019s the crash?\u201d* but IMO we\u2019re already in a slow-motion correction that\u2019s just starting to pick up speed. I see three possible paths from here: 1. Gradual deflation (most likely): 10\u201315% national decline, deeper in Sunbelt 2. Hard crash: 20\u201330% drop over 2\u20133 years if unemployment spikes 3. Sideways grind: 0\u20135% growth, but with affordability getting even worse Either way, I don\u2019t think this ends with prices just going sideways forever. Something\u2019s gotta give. Curious what everyone else is seeing. Especially in the Sunbelt or second-tier markets. Anyone seeing panic selling yet? Builders offering deep incentives? Inventory sitting longer than expected? Btw, I run something called [Dealsletter](http://www.dealsletter.io). Where I track distressed or investor-ready deals (mostly BRRRRs, flips, etc.), but I\u2019ve also started using it to flag regional cracks and overpriced listings. Happy to share if you\u2019re into data-heavy stuff like this.",

There are a lot of structural issues with housing that people aren\u2019t talking about. This isn\u2019t just a bubble from low rates, it\u2019s also tied deeply to demographics. Baby boomers are retiring en masse, and a huge portion of their net worth is tied up in housing. Many also own rental homes because it was such a popular investment over the past few decades. The biggest issue almost no one talks about is the skilled trades shortage that\u2019s set to explode in the 2030s. Maintaining all these oversized McMansions is going to become extremely expensive when there simply aren\u2019t enough electricians, HVAC techs, plumbers, or roofers to go around. That\u2019s not something interest rates can fix. Speaking of rates, there\u2019s honestly no realistic way the Fed can drop them back to ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) levels without tanking the dollar or reigniting runaway inflation. Most serious forecasts see a new normal of higher-for-longer, think 4\u20135% mortgage rates at best, not 2\u20133% again. If we do see a true crash, it\u2019ll likely be in the 2030s, driven by maintenance costs spiraling and boomers selling off properties as they shift into assisted living. Aging in place is getting more expensive, not less. Ironically, homes designed for downsizing, smaller, efficient layouts in walkable areas, could actually appreciate heavily, because they\u2019ll match what the market needs. Bottom line: the entire narrative that \u201chousing always goes up\u201d ignores both demographics and the trades crunch. Long term, that\u2019s going to reshape what types of homes actually hold value.",

My hypothesis is that a ton of households took out bad (ie. risky) mortgages just to get into a house hoping to refinance at a more attractive (ie. affordable) interest rate in the very near future. Since mortgage rates aren't going to be decreasing to below 4% anytime soon, they are choosing to go into credit card and/or auto loan debt instead of defaulting on the mortgage.

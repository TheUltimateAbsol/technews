Arrow Lake CPUs only run gear 2 mode at minimum because it targets high frequency memory, gear 2 is the same as 1:2 ratio on AMD for memory, and here he has ran all the tests on DDR5-6000. This alone benefits AMD by a significant amount because Arrow Lake is not designed to run below JEDEC spec. Arrow Lake's JEDEC default is actually 6400. The expectation for a good testing is at least throw on a pair of CUDIMM and run them on XMP. What we have in comparison now in terms of bandwidth is setting half bandwidth access for Intel, and also underclock memory vs full bandwidth on AMD with overclocked memory from 5600 to 6000. If someone did a test that disabled the 3D cache I'm sure people will be rioting with pitchforks out",

        "text_content": ">Several people have confirmed that Valve is aiming to release new standalone, wireless VR headset (codename Deckard) by the end of 2025. The current price for the full bundle is set to be $1200. Including some \"in-house\" games (or demos) that are already done. Valve want to give the user the best possible experience without cutting any costs. Even at the current price, it will be sold at a loss. A few months ago, we saw leaked models of controllers (codename Roy) in the SteamVR update. It will be using the same SteamOS from Steam Deck, but adapted for virtual reality. One of the core features is the ability to play flat-screen game that are already playable on Steam Deck, but in VR on a big screen without a PC. The first behind closed doors presentations could start soon.

We just didn't know for sure G was *another Konami collaboration* until today, and we were just speculating or trusting bad sources ([I made a post about it in here, too](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hia2gt/silent_hill_3_remake_and_maybe_1_by_bloober_team/)). So now that we officially know that Project G is another Konami game that was approved at least 1 year before Silent Hill 2 Remake was even released, it's possible that the post and the source were in the right direction, and it's interesting to know that both Project G and H are being done internally, and both were [revealed to be coming at the same time in 2023](https://wnhub.io/news/other/item-45059). And, like mentioned in the previous linked post, to see that they're the only current Bloober projects with an alphabetical order compared to all the others (Project C, M and F). Considering SH1 and SH3 follow the same story, it's possible they were approved at the same time.",

                "raw_content": "* That\u2019s up from 15% a year ago. The typical U.S. homebuyer now puts down roughly $63,000, about $4,000 more than last year, because of a jump in home prices. * About 31% of buyers are purchasing homes using all cash, down from about 34% a year earlier. * 15% of mortgaged homebuyers are using FHA loans, and roughly 7% are using VA loans. The amount of money homebuyers are putting down is higher than a year ago mainly because home prices are up: A higher price means buyers typically make a bigger deposit. The median U.S. home-sale price rose 6.3% year over year in December, to roughly $428,000. The percentage buyers are putting down is relatively high because mortgage rates are elevated near 7%, and some buyers are putting down more up front to bring down their monthly interest payments. Down payments are no longer seeing the wild swings they were during the pandemic. The median U.S. down payment rose from the 10% range before the pandemic to the 15% range in 2021, which was the height of the pandemic homebuying frenzy. Mortgage rates also drove that increase, but the dynamics were very different then: Record-low rates of under 3% were fueling intense bidding wars among homebuyers, which motivated many to put more money down to make their offers stand out in a competitive environment. \u201cWhile a larger down payment can lower monthly mortgage payments and help strengthen an offer in a bidding war, bigger isn\u2019t always better,\u201d said Sheharyar Bokhari, a senior economist at Redfin. \u201cHousing markets in much of the country have started tilting in buyers\u2019 favor, allowing buyers to set the terms they want. That means house hunters don\u2019t necessarily need to break the bank for a huge down payment if it makes more financial sense to save some money for things like future home renovations or other investments.\u201d 31% of Homebuyers Pay in Cash, Down From 34% a Year Ago Roughly three in 10 (30.6%) U.S. homes were bought with all cash in December. That\u2019s down from 33.8% a year earlier, but up from September\u2019s three-year low of 28.6%. The share of buyers paying in cash peaked in 2023 because that\u2019s when mortgage rates peaked, hitting a two-decade high of nearly 8%. Buyers who can afford to pay in cash are more inclined to do so when rates are high because they\u2019re avoiding high monthly interest payments, and saving money in the long run. Mortgage rates have since come down slightly and evened out in the 6% to 7% range, bringing down the share of buyers who are paying in all cash. Additionally, investors\u2013who make up a big share of all-cash buyers\u2013are purchasing fewer homes. On an annual basis, 32.6% of 2024\u2019s home sales were made in cash, the lowest share in three years. 15% of Mortgaged Homebuyers Use FHA Loans, Little Changed From a Year Ago Roughly one of every seven (15%) mortgaged home sales used an FHA loan in December, down slightly from 15.9% a year earlier but up from mid-2022\u2019s decade-low of roughly 10% . The share of mortgaged home sales using a VA loan rose to 6.7%, from 6.2% a year earlier. FHA and VA loans are both insured by the U.S. government. FHA loans, meant for low-to-moderate-income borrowers and popular with first-time homebuyers, have lower financial requirements than conventional loans; typically, they require a 3.5% down payment. VA loans are available to veterans, service members and their surviving spouses, and require little to no down payment. More homebuyers are using FHA loans now than in late 2021 and early 2022, when the ultra-competitive environment favored buyers with higher down payments and more ability to prove their financial security. Now, buyers are more likely to get an offer using an FHA loan accepted. Additionally, higher home prices mean more buyers find it hard to afford large down payments, making FHA loans more popular. Conventional loans are by far the most common type of mortgage. Nearly four in five (78.4%) borrowers used a conventional loan in December, little changed from 77.9% a year earlier.",

Spending by working-class and middle-class households, meanwhile, dropped over the same period. >\u201cThe finances of the well-to-do have never been better, their spending never stronger and the economy never more dependent on that group,\u201d said Zandi, who oversaw the analysis, which was based on data from the Federal Reserve. The analysis runs through the third quarter of 2024 because that is the most recent data available. >Taken together, well-off people have increased their spending far beyond inflation, while everyone else hasn\u2019t. The bottom 80% of earners spent 25% more than they did four years earlier, barely outpacing price increases of 21% over that period. The top 10% spent 58% more. >A stock market selloff or decline in home values that rattles the confidence of the top 10% and causes them to cut back would have a significant effect on the economy. Consumer sentiment is starting to slide overall, including for the wealthiest third of consumers, thanks in part to tariff threats. I found this to be a pretty alarming statistic. If the top 10% start pulling back it could be catastrophic. It just feels like a small percentage are what's keeping this economy afloat and everyone else is trying to get blood from a stone.",

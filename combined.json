WiMax went big in low income countries because it was cheaper to roll out than LTE and as of 2025 there are over a billion people being served internet connections over that technology that was steamrolled in the North American markets by the likes of Qualcomm. They're not your friends. But I do respect some of their research. They've done some crazy stuff with network switch fabrics in both electronic and photonic networks. They're a big evil company with a history of bullying and using lawyers to push people around so you have to expect that if they're coming for an open source project, it's a hostile move. Why and to what end though? Every hobbyist uses clones anyway and it's like a five dollar board running a fifty cent chip. The freakin' genric USB cable and 1A USB power supply costs almost as much as the board. What part of that are you going to corner?",

        "score": 41,
        "text_content": "When reading through various CPU optimization manuals, it seems that most vendors use the following terminology when defining the stages of the CPU pipeline: - Dispatch: Transferring the uops from the frontend to backend(allocating a ROB + scheduler entry along with other resources) - Issue: when the uop is sent from the scheduler to the execution unit to be executed [AMD](https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/58455_1.00), [Arm](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109757/0301/?lang=en), [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/cpu-optimization-guide) (you need a developer account to access their optimization guide), and the [RISCV Boom](https://docs.boom-core.org/en/latest/) microarchitecture docs all use the above terminology. However, Intel seems to use the term \"dispatch\" to refer to when uops are sent to the execution unit, and \"issue\" for when uops are sent from the frontend to the backend. [LLVM]( https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/39d4dfbe55cbea6ca7d506b8acd8455ed0443bf9/llvm/lib/Target/X86/X86ScheduleZnver4.td#L2) also uses Intel's terminology, however, I believe this is because Intel cpus were one of the first CPUs they created a scheduler model for, although this could be wrong. Does anyone know why Intel defines these terms differently from the rest of the industry? Not hating on Intel, I'm just curious. Edit: You can see Intel's use of the terminology when looking at their [perf events](https://perfmon-events.intel.com/): - UOPS_ISSUED.ANY: Counts the number of uops issued by the front end every cycle. - UOPS_DISPATCHED.ALU: Number of ALU integer uops dispatch to execution.

Really happy that they also implemented PD In @ 100W, so you can go with a more compact PD 3.0 charger. Shipping 4 different electric plugs for the power brick feels a bit wasteful though. The 2242 screw support being unfinished metal also feels a bit odd, because on my unit it looks like it rusted a bit, but nothing I feel worried about so far. I used an old Win 10 image for a first functionality test. It was from a N150 mini PC test 2 months prior, and after installing the cpu drivers the fans stopped going overboard and USB-DP alt mode also started working as intended. After I get a fresh image I can do some actual testing.",

Still not quite at the 83% threshold for Board Certified Radiologists but this is great progress. And for context, the Godfather of AI Geoffrey Hinton had stated all radiologist doctors would have been automated by 2021. So we are still way behind schedule but this is promising. This is a benchmark where Grok 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 are still scoring at 0% on. The closest competitor is GPT5 at 30%. Gemini 2.5 had scored 29%. Google increased performance by 22%. *IF* they can maintain this same level of progress for their next model updates, Gemini would cross the Board Certified Radiologists threshold by 2027.",

I played around with Gemini 3 pro before testing it and was quite excited as it felt really clever, and I was expecting it to be a new SOTA. But, it failed to beat Opus 4.1, or even o4 mini from April this year. However, in the heatmap you can see Gemini 3 pro has a yellow square in column 5. The columns are the question number, and the row the attempt number. Each question is repeated 5 times to get an average score. The yellow in column 5 means it actually solved this problem, at least once. Question 5 is the second hardest in this benchmark, and despite failing to solve a single instance of question 2, it found a solution to this vastly more difficult problem. I'm not sure what happened there, but even though its an overall bad performance, it is an ***interesting*** performance.",

Every model I've tried since then also failed pretty badly--this is the first decent boarding platform I've gotten. But the track is still random optical illusion spaghetti.",

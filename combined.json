Not to mention Yuji Horii usual slips. The design choice for the new Formism figures is interesting, as Square has been experimenting with doll-like figure designs for newer games. [DQ7 Reimagined, for example, uses this approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSBxpnOMQhk). Also, someone in a video from about a month ago suggested that Horii was, apparently, supervising the new character designs to keep them faithful to Toriyama's style. https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pd98hi/during_horiis_latest_kosokoso_h\u014ds\u014d_kyoku_talk/ [Around 1:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq1II1jaiuA&t=6628s) Rough translation: >Girl (Naz Chris): I don't intend to dig any deeper than this, but Horii-san you made a promise before, well, a soft promise to me > Regarding Chrono, specifically that character... > That you would supervise/check it. > If you don't supervise it, I really don't want a repeat of the (Dragon Ball Super?) situation.

Lunar Lake was built specifically for low-power use like 15\u201330 W. On-package LPDDR, fewer cores, no HT, very aggressive power gating. It\u2019s basically Intel\u2019s \u201chow far can we push efficiency\u201d design. In that low-power range, it\u2019s still the best Intel has. Panther Lake isn\u2019t trying to replace that. It\u2019s a mainstream, scalable platform meant to replace Meteor Lake / Arrow Lake-H. It runs across a much wider power range and scales way better once you push performance. That\u2019s where the \u201c30% efficiency\u201d claims come from - higher performance points, not idle or light workloads. So yeah, Panther Lake laptops will still have good battery life compared to older Intel systems, especially with bigger batteries. But in the same thin-and-light chassis, they\u2019re not going to beat Lunar Lake at low power. Different designs, different goals. Lunar Lake = efficiency king at low power Panther Lake = way better than Arrow Lake, scales much higher Marketing just mashes that into one catchy line Curious how others here are interpreting Intel\u2019s messaging, because it feels like a lot of people are talking past each other on this.",

You can be fine on VSoC and PBO but your 9800X3D will randomly start pulling 200-300 watts on the new AGESA version(s). With the ASRock boards it seemed like an actual hardware issue where for reasons that are not yet completely clear the board would request a CRAZY amount of voltage for a fraction of a second but those weird spikes would be enough to fry the chip/board at times.

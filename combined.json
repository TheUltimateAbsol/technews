It\u2019s not just about getting the game at the same time, though\u2014it\u2019s the fact that it looks and runs nearly identical to the other platforms. \u200b I actually own a PS5. But with RE9, I consciously chose the Switch 2 version. For the first time, I made that choice for such a big game without any second-guessing or \"fear of missing out\" on the visuals. \u200bWe are finally at a point where: \u200bNo more \"wait and see\": We get to join the hype cycle and day-one discussions with everyone else. \u200bVisual Parity: The gap in lighting, textures, and resolution has shrunk so much that the differences are negligible in motion. \u200bTrue Portability: Being able to take an experience of this caliber on the go without it feeling like a \"compromised\" version is still mind-blowing to me. \u200bThis feels like a huge green flag for the future of the Switch 2. If third-party devs are already hitting this level of optimization, the next few years are going to be incredible for the community. \u200bWhat do you all think?

I was playing GBC during the N64/PS1 generation, which was roughly equivalent to an NES. The GBA coexisted with the PS2/GCN/Xbox and its library was heavily subsidized by SNES ports, etc. I think the distinction became a little less clear when the Vita and 3DS coexisted with the tail end of the PS3/360 generation and the beginning of the PS4 era. When the Switch came out, I generally thought of it as a portable PS3/360 - it was nice to really only be about one generation behind the home consoles, though that chasm grew wider towards the end of the Switch's lifespan. The Switch 2 is clearly behind the PS5 and the Series X in power. But I do think we're at a phase where it's a lot harder for me to conceptualize any specific type of game that wouldn't be able to work on the Switch 2 in some way, shape, or form - it just seems like a matter of whether devs are willing to put in the work/money and players are willing to overlook the sacrifices made on the graphics/performance side of things. One thing that I do hope is that Epic finds a way to get Unreal Engine 5 to play nicer with Switch - it feels like the ports that have had real trouble (e.g. Borderlands 3) come down to UE5 just not working super-well on Switch 2.",

        "text_content": "In a new Atlantic interview, Terence Tao explains the **promise** of generative AI while weighing in on recent claims that AI systems have helped solve open Erd\u0151s problems. He cautions against hype. Many of the AI generated solutions involve less prominent problems in the long tail of over 1,000 Erd\u0151s questions. Tao describes several as **cheap wins,** often relying on known techniques that a human expert could likely have applied with sufficient time. However, he acknowledges meaningful progress. **Compared** to 2024, models have improved in certain types of high level mathematical reasoning and are now useful collaborators. Tao **believes** AI is roughly on schedule to reach the level of a trusted junior co author by 2026, particularly strong at handling tedious cases and large scale exploration. He suggests AI may shift mathematics from handcrafted case studies toward broader **population level** exploration of problems at scale. At the same time, AI proofs often lack the conceptual trail and deeper insight that human mathematicians generate. Tao calls for **better** uncertainty signaling from AI systems and favors interactive human AI collaboration over fully autonomous push button workflows. **His overall stance is measured:** AI is not about to solve the hardest open problems overnight, but it is beginning to change how mathematics is practiced. **Source:** The Atlantic (Exclusive)",

And the reason I think I like Stephen Miller even more than Tom Homan is neither give a crap about political correctness and how lefties and normies perceive things, but between the two, it seems like Tom is that way because he's very naturally that way being real old school, which is great, but Stephen strikes me as a guy who even more intellectually assesses the beliefs of the left and the normies, and the feel of things and disregards any of it and turns his dial of not giving a crap up to 11 out of pure spite for everything they represent. Everything the dude says is like a breath of fresh air and is just refreshingly raw. Tom Homan has it too, don't get me wrong, and again he's my second favorite person in Trump's orbit, but Stephen Miller takes the cake.",

Flip-metering improves video frame pacing to the GPU and reduces CPU overhead for video playback. There is also a display engine level hardware image sharpening component that drives Radeon Image Sharpening. As for I/O, you get contemporary DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b, we are waiting to confirm the UHBR bit-rates. Idle power has been a topic of discssion for RDNA3 MCM cards, so it's good to hear this. Also interesting to hear they have something similar to hardware flip-metering. >Navi 48 comes a **dual media engine**, each of the **two can perform concurrent encoding and decoding**, and so the implementation resembles an NVIDIA GPU having two each of NVENC and NVDEC units. The new generation media engine offers a 25% increase in H.264 low-latency encode quality, and an 11% improvement in HEVC encode quality. AV1 encode and decode gets B-frames support, vastly improving bitrates. A B-frame is a frame that lacks image information, but instead motion-vector values, that lets the decoder reconstruct the image component using past and future I-Frames (frames with image data). The media engine posts a 50% generational performance uplift (measured in encoder/decoder frame rates), with reductions in memory overhead. FINALLY, this is big news. So many leaks and rumours on perf, but the media engine is what I've been wanting to see. Interested to see some testing especially from EposVox. Really hope split-encode/decode will take off. This is pretty much RTX 5080 HW acceleration access (5070 Ti has 2 encode, 1 decode). This is a segment of the market AMD really needs to expand upon. There's also a lot of more info. The rest, AI, RT, memory hierarchy looks greatly improved. Hopefully Chips&Cheese also does a deep dive!",

If you really wanted to make a change convincing random people on the internet is not going to do shit, you need big names to spread that message, idk any Pok\u00e9mon youtubers but I would try convincing them to spread the message to not buy Z-A if it looks bad or just a big name youtuber in general. I know that's easier said than done, but I'd rather people try to get the big names to spread the message, rather than delude themselves into thinking they can actually make a change themselves.",

I don't think a 20W handheld would be viable for Valve nor do I think a new Steam Deck revision would use an \"Aerith Plus\" chip since they left behind Aerith with the OLED revision. Plus Aerith had computer vision bits that the original Steam Deck didn't use, so I could see that potentially being useful for VR applications. **EDIT:** [Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed this isn't for a Deck, so now I'm definitely leaning in the Deckard direction.](https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3ljbhm2txns2a)",

If you've recently upgraded your motherboard to one of our new X870 or recently launched B850 or B840 motherboards, you might feel like it's time to continue the AMD trend and upgrade your graphics card. For those who are less familiar with the new cards, here are the new main features: * The new RDNA 4 architecture * 16GB GDDR6 VRAM * Next-gen HYPR-RX tech delivers ultra-fast gaming * New AMD AI-powered technologies, including an improved experience with ray-tracing. * Machine-learning based super resolution mode compatible with select FSR 3.1 games provide an incredible balance of detailed images and fluid frame rates. * DisplayPort 2.1 outputs give users massive bandwidth for going big on resolution while supporting high-end refresh rates On the ASUS side, we've implemented a number of new changes to our cooling design, PCB design, and optional software: **Phase-Change Thermal Pads Provide a Long-Lasting Cooling Experience** One new change for our graphics cards this year is that we're switching from standard thermal paste used on the GPU and thermal module to phase-change thermal pads. When transferring heat, the electrically non-conductive pad is a solid at room temperature but liquifies as it heats up. As it melts, it fills the microscopic gaps between the GPU and thermal module, providing superior thermal conductivity and enhanced heat dissipation, ensuring optimal performance, even for sustained, heavy GPU workloads. Additionally, the phase-change thermal pads offer exceptional longevity. They outlast traditional pastes by a significant margin, even for graphics cards that see heavy workloads on a regular basis. **ASUS GPU Tweak III Software** \\- Some gamers prefer to tune their graphics cards for all-out performance, while others insist on quiet operation. A physical Dual BIOS switch lets users choose between performance and quiet modes without installing additional software. For more performance-tuning options, easy hardware monitoring and granular control of fan behavior, users can download the free ASUS GPU Tweak III software. **ASUS GPU Guard & Bracket\\*** \\- ASUS GPU Guard applies adhesive to secure all four corners to reduce the risk of cracks, while a GPU bracket helps ensure uniform mounting pressure and extra stability. **Protective PCB Coating\\*** \\- A protective conformal coating envelops the circuit board to help protect against short-circuits caused by moisture, dust or debris. \\*Available only on the TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 cards **TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition and TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition** https://preview.redd.it/4zxtc3j5nvle1.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12bb410662c4cb748df61dacfc3650076364fd11 TUF Gaming graphics cards utilize an unassuming style that fits in easily with just about any components on the market. For the TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, ASUS has retained the classic ruggedized aesthetic of the series. An illuminated TUF Gaming logo on the corner of the card provides a touch of personalization, and it supports ASUS Aura Sync so users can coordinate its lighting with the rest of their compatible gear. The TUF Gaming design for this series delves deep into the standard excellent cooling that a TUF Gaming card provides and makes sure that gamers are well equipped in case they want to adjust their cooling or performance characteristics. These cards sport the typical metal exoskeleton for structural rigidity that the TUF Gaming cards are known for. Wide vents on the aluminum backplate allow heat to exhaust into the main airflow channel of your chassis. It wouldn't be a TUF Gaming card if it didn't include military-grade components for solid power delivery and long lifespan, or a PCB coating to protect it against short-circuits caused by moisture, dust, or debris. TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 cards feature: * 3.125-slot design with a vented exoskeleton and massive fin array optimized for airflow from three Axial-tech fans * Three eleven-blade Axial-tech fans maintain a steady high-pressure stream of cooling through a massive airflow-optimized fin array. * Dual-ball fan bearings last up to twice as long as conventional sleeve-bearing designs. * 0dB technology allows the fans to turn off at low workloads and effectively become silent. * Dual BIOS switch to toggle between Performance and Quiet BIOS profiles. * ASUS GPU Guard and bracket secure the GPU, reducing the risk of cracks and ensuring stable mounting * Subtle RGB lighting on the TUF Gaming logo on the corner of the card can be configured through Aura Sync * GPU Tweak III software is free to monitor and configure your graphics card. The software now integrates the HW Info plug-in so you can keep an eye on your graphics card and just about anything else in your system. https://preview.redd.it/bl4k27m3nvle1.jpg?width=7344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d3dabfa8757cbdf56a0956b720844daa9aae3c0 **Pricing and Availability -** Pricing \u2013 TBD (Will be updated when available) Availability \u2013 On-Shelf March 6 at 6AM PT Product Page - * TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition 16GB GDDR6 - [https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070xt-o16g-gaming/](https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070xt-o16g-gaming/) * TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition 16GB GDDR6 - [https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070-o16g-gaming/](https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070-o16g-gaming/) **ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition and Prime Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition** https://preview.redd.it/vl3o6xsmnvle1.jpg?width=7667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a22553134cc5d2da72fe23dcaf8c3c3da05ef4ee ASUS Prime graphics cards were a new addition to our lineup last year. Packing performance and cooling into a compact 2.5 slot frame, these cards help ensure compatibility with more cases. Building a card this size that can handle the demands of long hours of gaming requires attention to a number of important details. To make sure they offer excellent cooling performance compatible with a number of compact cases, Prime series cards use three Axial-tech fans, similar to the fans we use on our top-end graphics cards - but use a smaller fan hub that allows for longer fan blades. We then surround the fans in a barrier ring to increase downward pressure. The card also features: * Dual-ball fan bearings last up to twice as long as conventional sleeve-bearing designs. * 0dB technology to turn the fans off below 50C, and turn the fans back on at 55C with a speed curve optimized for cooling and noise. * Phase-change GPU thermal pads for optimal heat transfer and long-term reliability. * 2.5-slot design allows for greater build compatibility while maintaining cooling performance * Dual-BIOS switch that allows you to switch fan profiles between Performance and Quiet BIOS profiles. * Aluminum protective backplate to protect the card and provide structural integrity * GPU Tweak III software is free to monitor and configure your graphics card.

About 14.3% of sales agreements fell through in January, up from 13.4% a year earlier and the highest level for the month in data going back to 2017, according to data from brokerage Redfin Corp. House hunters face an ever-growing list of pressures, from high mortgage rates and prices to concerns about how trade wars and federal government cutbacks may ripple through the economy.

Some people are choosing to stay put.\u201d Atlanta had the highest rate of cancellations last month, at 19.8%. Following were Orlando, Las Vegas, Houston and Jacksonville, Florida, each at around 18%. Rising inventory in certain markets may be behind some cancellations. More supply in those areas \u201cmeans buyers have license to be fickle,\u201d Redfin said. If an issue comes up in the inspection period, buyers may back out because they see opportunity to find a better home that doesn\u2019t have that issue. Some agents are advising buyers not to give up on homes they want, even if they\u2019ve lost a bidding war. \u201cIt\u2019s worth checking in with the listing agent about a week after the house goes under contract,\u201d said Alison Williams, a Redfin agent in Sacramento, California. \u201cTwice since the start of the year, I\u2019ve found out the original buyer canceled the contract, and my clients were able to get their offers accepted before the home went back on the market.\u201d",

Housing inventory has risen to its highest level since 2020, giving homebuyers more options. At the same time, pending home sales fell to their lowest level on record (aside from the start of the pandemic) in January. More supply and less demand means the housing market has tilted in buyers\u2019 favor, with some house hunters backing out during the inspection period because a better house for them has come along\u2013or at least the promise of a better house. >Economic uncertainty. Redfin agents report that some deals are falling through because buyers (and sometimes, sellers) are getting cold feet due to widespread economic and political uncertainty. Tariffs, layoffs, and federal policy changes are among the factors contributing to an air of instability. Some people are choosing to stay put. >Sticker shock. Mortgage rates and home prices remain stubbornly high, with January\u2019s average rate hitting 6.96%, an eight-month high (weekly average rates have since declined to 6.76%, and the median U.S. home-sale price rising 4.1%.

I\u2019ve heard Demis Hassabis speak about creating a virtual cell, and maybe that could potentially shorten the trial timelines.

I like to come back to overly-optimistic AI predictions that did not come to pass, which is important in my view given that this entire sub is dedicated to those predictions. Prediction of the week this time is Joe Russo claiming that anyone would be able to ask an AI to build a full movie based on their preferences, and it would autonomously generate one including visuals, audio, script etc, all by April 2025. See below. When asked in \u201chow many years\u201d AI will be able to \u201cactually create\u201d a movie, Russo predicted: \u201cTwo years.\u201d The director also theorized on how advanced AI will eventually give moviegoers the chance to create different movies on the spot. \u201cPotentially, what you could do with \\[AI\\] is obviously use it to engineer storytelling and change storytelling,\u201d Russo said. \u201cSo you have a constantly evolving story, either in a game or in a movie or a TV show. You could walk into your house and save the AI on your streaming platform. \u2018Hey, I want a movie starring my photoreal avatar and Marilyn Monroe\u2019s photoreal avatar. I want it to be a rom-com because I\u2019ve had a rough day,\u2019 and it renders a very competent story with dialogue that mimics your voice. It mimics your voice, and suddenly now you have a rom-com starring you that\u2019s 90 minutes long.

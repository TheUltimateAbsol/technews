They are the fastest by a decent amount in Geekbench 6, they are fastest by a hell of a lot in Cinebench 2024 and they are also totally unmatched in Speedometer 3.1. Even anecdotally, MacBooks seem snappier in use than any high power non-Apple computer. Why is it so? Is their architecture so much superior? Surely macOS can't be that light. The node advantage isn't that huge. The M5 MacBook Pro can cross 200 points in CineBench 2024 in single core. On battery. With the fans off. The M5 Pro and M5 Max might go faster. The 9950X and 285K barely hit 150. The 275HX (285K's laptop version) doesn't get beyond 140. Do we believe Zen 6 will be 33% faster in single core to make up that gap? Even then, will it be power efficient enough to do it in a laptop? If anything, it looks like the Snapdragon X2 Elite might be closest when it ships with an \\~180 score and it might cross 50 in Speedometer 3.1. M5 does 62-63. Why such a difference?",

AMD & Intel care less because they need to sell datacenter CPUs, too, and they must share the same (or nearly the same) microarchitecture in servers, too. - Apple has been making CPUs for mobile for a decade plus, so they are pushed to focus on IPC more than clocks. They need to reuse the same microarchitecture (or they chose to). - Apple can\u2019t let up because now iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs (the majority of all revenue) depend on newer CPUs. - Apple has to release a new microarchitecture each year because they sell hundreds of millions of phones each year with the expectation consumers are getting a faster SoC. - Apple has fierce competition in the mobile space. Qualcomm, Arm, MediaTek, Samsung, Google, etc. all release mobile SoCs. So they are forced to compete, versus AMD & Intel that are a duopoly. - Apple sells relatively high-end devices, so Apple can spend more money on better engineers, better architects, better validation, better modeling, better optimization, better DTCO, better everything frankly. So that means Apple is already geared to focus on 1T performance in structural ways. But it\u2019s not like some \u201cspecial Apple-exclusive patent\u201d. Anyone and everyone can do it, if they dedicate the time, effort, money, engineering, patience, etc. Just look at NUVIA at Qualcomm now. The die sizes argument is a little tired and predominantly false. https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1fuuucj/lunar_lake_die_shot/ CPUs are relatively small parts of the die. Anyone who wants bigger CPUs can do it tomorrow. Shrink the NPU and GPU (huge parts of the die) a bit, voila, you can increase your CPU die allocation by 20% to 50% \u201covernight\u201d. That is, AMD and Intel did their best and it still was not enough to beat Apple in 1T perf.",

Also, the download link for the latest generation (9000 Series) only grabs version 3.0.0.4199. The other two are 2.x releases. Why are there three versions of RM now? Glad you asked. So, uh...

We developed an incremental modeling framework that progressively incorporates factors contributing to aging into a model of population survival dynamics, which we used to estimate lifespan limits if all aging hallmarks were eliminated except somatic mutations. **Our analysis reveals fundamental asymmetry across organs: post-mitotic cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes act as critical longevity bottlenecks, with somatic mutations reducing median lifespan from a theoretical non-aging baseline of 430 years to 169 years.** In contrast, proliferating tissues like liver maintain functionality for thousands of years through cellular replacement, effectively neutralizing mutation-driven decline. Multi-organ integration predicts median lifespans of 134-170 years \u2014approximately twice current human longevity. This substantial yet incomplete reduction indicates that somatic mutations significantly drive aging but cannot alone account for observed mortality, implying comparable contributions from other hallmarks.",

This isn't on a set of academic benchmarks; rather, it's on a set of real-world attributes that actual users and organizations care about. >The latest HUMAINE test evaluated 26,000 users in a blind test of models. In the evaluation, Gemini 3 Pro's trust score surged from 16% to 69%, the highest ever recorded by Prolific. Gemini 3 now ranks number one overall in trust, ethics and safety 69% of the time across demographic subgroups, compared to its predecessor Gemini 2.5 Pro, which held the top spot only 16% of the time. >Overall, Gemini 3 ranked first in three of four evaluation categories: performance and reasoning, interaction and adaptiveness and trust and safety. It lost only on communication style, where DeepSeek V3 topped preferences at 43%. The HUMAINE test also showed that Gemini 3 performed consistently well across 22 different demographic user groups, including variations in age, sex, ethnicity and political orientation. The evaluation also found that users are now five times more likely to choose the model in head-to-head blind comparisons. >\"It's the consistency across a very wide range of different use cases, and a personality and a style that appeals across a wide range of different user types,\" Phelim Bradley, co-founder and CEO of Prolific, told VentureBeat. \"Although in some specific instances, other models are preferred by either small subgroups or on a particular conversation type, it's the breadth of knowledge and the flexibility of the model across a range of different use cases and audience types that allowed it to win this particular benchmark.\" >The HUMAINE data provides a framework: Test for consistency across use cases and user demographics, not just peak performance on specific tasks. Blind the testing to separate model quality from brand perception. Use representative samples that match your actual user population. Plan for continuous evaluation as models change. >For enterprises looking to deploy AI at scale, this means moving beyond \"which model is best\" to \"which model is best for our specific use case, user demographics and required attributes.\"",

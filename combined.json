I have a 1000 FALD LCD from innocn before the upgrade that is 4k160, and yeah the pure blacks is amazing for dark mode / reading ebooks or playing HDR content that pops out that much better with good motion clarity but is it worth that extra cost to you, esp as the innocn went as low as 430 dollars on a huge sale (torpedoed by tariffs recently so maybe it would come back later?) but has more common 500 dollar sales. i would say that if you are a light mode enjoyer and play games that isnt properly HDR tuned or content that is HDR, then it really isnt as big of a deal I hope that soon there are 200 dollar oleds with say 120 hz or even just 90 hz or hell 60 for people who just wants dark mode and HDR content, I love mine for reading ebooks (in dark mode) and dark mode websites and videos that is HDR mastered, but for gaming I honestly dont know if just oled was worth the upgrade even 240 vs 160.",

The broad market index finished up 0.3% at 6,532.04, a record close for the index. It had risen about 0.7% at its peak to 6,555.97, scoring a new all-time intraday high as well. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.03% to end at 21,886.06, likewise notching a closing high after hitting an all-time intraday high prior to its afternoon pullback. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 220.42 points, or 0.48%, to finish at 45,490.92, bogged down by a decline in Apple shares as the latest iPhone announcement failed to impress investors. By the end of the session, most of the up-move was gone, with Oracle and artificial intelligence-linked stocks notching the biggest gains. There were more losers in the S&P 500 than winners. Sentiment was initially higher after the latest producer price index reading showed that wholesale prices fell 0.1% in August. Economists polled by Dow Jones had estimated a 0.3% gain. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy prices, likewise declined 0.1%, while the consensus called for 0.3%. The report serves as a positive sign heading into Thursday\u2019s more closely watched consumer price index reading that inflation in the U.S. economy is cooling. Economists expect the CPI report to show monthly increases of 0.3%, according to Dow Jones. This includes the headline index as well as the core reading that excludes volatile food and energy prices. If this materializes, the annual headline CPI rate would be pushed up to 2.9%, though the core reading is expected to stay unchanged at 3.1%. If the numbers come in around these estimates, the Federal Reserve will have room to deliver another rate cut at its September meeting, according to CFRA Research\u2019s Sam Stovall. Traders currently see a certainty that the Fed will cut by at least a quarter point, per the CME Fedwatch tool based on fed futures trading. They also increased their bets following the PPI data that the central bank could make an even deeper cut to rates of 50 basis points, or a half percentage point. \u201cWith the PPI surprising to the downside, with the employment data showing much greater softness than anticipated, that basically says that there could be a reason for the Fed to cut by 50 basis points,\u201d Stovall said to CNBC. \u201cWhat they want to do is to ensure that they are not going to be too slow, as the president describes Fed Chair Powell, and that they do at least keep up with or get ahead of the overall weakening trend.\u201d \u201cThat could, I think, certainly light a fire under the market between now and the end of the year,\u201d the chief investment strategist added.",

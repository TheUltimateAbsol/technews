I think Tomodachi Life would actually have the most potential as a system seller, but that is a Switch 1 game and doesn't even have a Switch 2 Edition. So, I don't think millions of people will be buying a Switch 2 for that game. Splatoon Raiders may be a system seller in Japan (despite being a spin-off) but probably won't be a big hit in the rest of the world. Of course, there is one major first-party game that is basically guaranteed to come out this holiday: Pokemon Gen 10.

I mean, imagine if they announced this project today rather than 10 years ago - how much faith would any of us have that a AAA company would handle such a project successfully? But respect where it's due, they took on a challenge hugely filled with risk and the possibility of tarnishing a legend, and they absolutely triumphed - to the extent that if the final part manages to keep the quality up (or even escalate it), they may have created one of the all-time great trilogies in gaming in its own right.",

Yes, it's at 30 frames per second and not 60, but the drop off in quality compared to PlayStation is not that noticeable. There really is no excuse anymore for every single high quality third party game not to be coming to the Switch 2.

I'm playing far fewer games but playing each game for significantly longer. On Switch 1, I was playing a lot of arcade games, shmups, indies - as well as, of course, first party games - and I'd sometimes go through long periods of playing a new game almost every week. On Switch 2, however, I'm playing closer to a single game a month, but despite that reduction, the amount of time I'm playing the system has nearly doubled. Don't know if it's just coincidence or because the Switch 2 is offering better access to longer, meatier games (probably a bit of both), but it's been a nice change. I feel like each game I've played so far (with the exception of Hyrule Warriors) has been extremely memorable. I've also been taking more time within the games to just explore and look at stuff for no reason, as well as engaging with post-game content, whereas on Switch 1 I'd tend to move on immediately after hitting the credits. Anyone else found the Switch 2 has changed their habits at all?",

If the \"mom and pop\" investors or the big funds can\u2019t find renters\u2014or if the rent no longer covers the mortgage/HOA/taxes\u2014those properties become liabilities instead of assets. Logically, the next step is those investors \"throwing in the towel\" and listing those homes for sale, which would finally fix our inventory problem and pull prices down.

What they either don't know because they are too young or just too stubborn is the fact that others are passing them by as they have sold their house and moved to what they wanted / where they wanted. Or in the case of car dealers yeah they lost $10k selling that car because they had to drop the price that much. But they are not longer paying the monthly interest on having it sit there and if / when they do sell it at the price they wanted they are loosing more since they didn't get to turn inventory and paid interest to have it sit on their lot that much longer. 2026 will see a drop in interest rates, but with inflation and the general cost of living going up it's not going to matter.

But IMO unemployment is a much bigger issue, and there is no way they raise rates if unemployment keeps ticking up the way it has. And with the recent job report numbers, and this current admin, I highly doubt we get anything other than higher unemployment. In that scenario the fed cuts 100%.

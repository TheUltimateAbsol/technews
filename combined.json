I even went and linked Nvidia's own timings of DLSS from different GPUs, and explained how scaling from those numbers to Switch 2's level doesn't align with their own timings. I took a screenshot because I was pretty sure they'd delete it as it didn't conform to their narrative.

This cheaper model of DLSS is newer and in their experience it causes image quality to have characteristics I described here. It suffers in movement, although it may be sharper in stills.

This one? Listed for over $400k. This isn\u2019t a booming metro either \u2014 it\u2019s a rural area with a median home price around $350k and average household incomes in the ~$90k range. On top of that, we\u2019ve got a shortage of builders, construction loans are tough to get, and building here is slower and more expensive than in other parts of the country. When you put all that together, the list price makes zero sense. To make it worse, the last sale of this same parcel was 9 years ago. At today\u2019s price they\u2019re implying 625% appreciation \u2014 about 25% annualized. Meanwhile, everything else in the area has appreciated maybe 30\u201340% total. I\u2019d be an all-cash, no-contingency buyer, and the property is contiguous to my current home. This could have been a clean, easy deal. Instead, the price is so out of touch that negotiations feel dead before they start. So my question is simply this: why? Why would a realtor list something this disconnected from comps, income levels, and local realities? Is there some strategy here I\u2019m missing, or is it just greed and wishful thinking?",

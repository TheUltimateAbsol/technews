When he reported the incident to the resident assistant, the attorneys said Bard's son began receiving threats. >Bard's lawyers said that three days before the shooting at KSU, the same son and his three friends were assaulted by 15 to 20 people. They also claim the son was attacked with baseball bats and weapons in his dorm room by 20-30 people the day before the shooting. Given all of this this sounds like the jury did its job and protected the accused from government bullshit considering that all of this stemmed from the father's sons telling the campus police who pulled the dorm fire alarm to clear the building out so the mob could loot it.

        "text_content": "Huawei is set to intensify its expansion into the Korean market by introducing its latest AI chip, 'Ascend,' domestically next year. Balian Wang, CEO of Huawei Korea, stated at the 'Huawei Day 2025' press conference held at The Plaza Hotel in Jung-gu, Seoul, on the 26th, \"Huawei Korea plans to officially launch AI computing cards and AI data center-related solutions next year,\" adding, \"We intend to provide Korean companies with a second option besides Nvidia.\" The chip to be released is expected to be the latest AI chip, the 'Ascend 950.' CEO Wang remarked, \"Unlike Nvidia, we plan to sell in cluster units rather than selling chips individually,\" adding, \"Huawei's strategy is not simply providing AI cards and AI servers, but accelerating industrial applications.\" To this end, the company plans to secure competitiveness by providing 'End-to-End' (E2E) solutions that encompass infrastructure hardware, such as networks and storage, as well as software. CEO Wang added, \"In this case, partner companies (for supply and sales) might not be necessary,\" noting, \"We will formulate a strategy so that Huawei can directly integrate and provide services.\" It is reported that Huawei Korea is currently in discussions with companies regarding potential supply agreements. Furthermore, Huawei Korea plans to supply its self-developed open-source operating system (OS), 'Harmony,' to domestic companies next year to promote the creation of an ecosystem. CEO Wang explained, \"Ownership of Harmony no longer belongs to Huawei, and open-source related organizations are now responsible for its operation and upgrades,\" adding, \"It can be utilized not only in smartphones but also in various smart home devices.\" However, he stated that there are no plans to launch smartphones in Korea next year.",

The trend was also evident in Micron\u2019s latest earnings. CNBC reported CEO Sanjay Mehrotra saying that server unit shipments grew in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in 2025. Meanwhile, Micron posted $5.28 billion in cloud memory sales, more than doubling year over year. - HBM Demand Surges, Micron Warns of DDR5 Resource Bottleneck: Micron also notes a crucial fact: the dramatic increase in HBM demand is further challenging the supply environment due to the 3-to-1 trade ratio with DDR5, and this trade ratio only increases with future generations of HBM. - Cleanroom Constraints: Micron also highlights a key factor behind tight memory supply: while additional cleanroom space is essential to meet soaring demand, construction lead times are stretching longer across regions.

It still snaps into the Switch 2 and the grip perfectly. This can absolutely be made to look nicer, I was impatient and didn't give the paint enough days to harden before using it so it looks a bit smushed in places. Some general tips if you want to also attempt this: * Be super careful when taking apart the joy-cons. They're full of tiny parts that will vanish if you don't keep track of them (oh god the springs). * Sand down surfaces really well. Paint adds thickness and these joy-cons already have really tight tolerances. * Be patient. Apply many thin layers of paint instead of a few thick and wet layers. Also let the paint harden for about a week before reassembling and using them in your switch. * Don't bother painting the straps. They are really tight-fitting and will remove the paint from your joy-cons unless you sand down the plastic heaps and trim the little nub on the inside. * This will definitely void your warranty (maybe do this on a second pair? I didn't lol). Feel free to ask any questions, I'd be happy to answer them since I wanted to keep this post short.",

With the Switch 2 the console / controllers are on top (left) and the remainder of the contents are layered underneath which means the box is more square instead of rectangular. The contents were spread out more in the original - Switch 2 box is more condensed despite a larger device. This would also have an impact on shipping overseas as all products are shipped based on weight not volume, so per pallet the shipping would be cheaper as the physical box / packaging is smaller -more boxes per pallet. Not to mention this means less cardboard used per box as well and Nintendo can get more boxes from the same amount of cardboard as less is used per box.",

And, the deadline to file a claim and get payment is December 27, 2025. In a nutshell, in 2020, Opendoor was accused of misleading investors about how its algorithm priced homes, its ability to keep stable margins, and how it would perform in a housing downturn. As disclosures rolled out between 2022 and 2023, the stock fell nearly 90%, and investors filed a lawsuit for their losses. After this news came out, the stock dropped sharply, and investors filed a lawsuit for their losses. Now, the good news is that the company agreed to settle $39M with them, and investors have until December 27, 2025 to submit a claim. So, if you invested in OPEN when all of this happened, you can check the details and file your claim [here](https://11th.com/cases/opendoor-investor-settlement). Anyway, has anyone here invested in OPEN at that time? How much were your losses, if so?",

Even apps like Cursor change the design and add / modify features weekly while at the same time the underlying API models are not deterministic, they can be good one week and bad the next if throttling or other changes are being made by the vendor or middlemen. You can develop an AI programming workflow that can be made obsolete in a few weeks or months by the tool vendors. It causes burnout as it is mentally taxing to work in high levels of abstraction that are constantly changing.",

I'd like to share my own opinion and first hand experience with the last 3 years of tech, and explicitly say I have no financial incentive to blindly agree with what Andrej is saying here. LLMs have legitimately changed the way I approach problems and tasks. Yes - these models hallucinate and have their quirks and pitfalls. They are not perfect. Not even close. But something I've noticed over the last few years, being closely involved with deploying some of these tools across my org, and using them extensively in my free time, is that they allow me to go from \"idea\" to \"demo/mvp/test\" in a fraction of the time. That example is very programming-centric. The concept applies to any domain. At its core, to me, these models have made it easier to brainstorm, explore ideas, challenge my own assumptions, and rapidly prototype in a way that was not possible for me prior to 2022. We have access to a new type of tool, and it's going to take time to learn what types of problems these tools are good for. If we have a tool that, in the right context, makes it easier to navigate through various ideas quicker - to me it is clear that this will have an impact downstream for so many things. I'm happy to hear any critiques or opinions on my experience here. I have no incentive to support these AI companies, and I am actively opposed to a lot of the abuse and misuse these tools are allowing. But to blindly ignore the positives is setting us up for failure.",

I have no answer to any questions my students ask about what they should study at university because by the time they're done and ready to join the workforce, I have no freaking idea what AI would be capable of by then. I would imagine robotics and then nano technology would come after the software side of AI dominance, but then again if they've created an AI that can do AI research, I see no reason why they can't create an AI that researches robotics or nano technology. All I *can* recommend is to study what you enjoy doing. If AI takes over everything then it doesn't matter what you studied. But if you studied something just for money and you hated it and it doesn't pan out, then you just wasted years of your life. If you enjoyed what you studied, at least you wouldn't consider it as your life wasted. And if AI *doesn't* take over it all, then you have a career that you love. Since you are interested in it (and the other software jobs seem much less secure), I'd say why not?",

In this work, we investigate whether considering human mental states in the decision-making process of a robot improves the transparency of its behaviours and mitigates potential human\u2019s false beliefs about the environment during collaborative scenarios. We used Bayesian inference within a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning algorithm to include human desires and beliefs into the decision-making processes of the robot, and to monitor the robot\u2019s decisions. This approach, which we refer to as Hierarchical Bayesian Theory of Mind, represents an upgraded version of the initial Bayesian Theory of Mind, a probabilistic model capable of reasoning about a rational agent\u2019s actions. The model enabled us to track the mental states of a human observer, even when the observer held false beliefs, thereby benefiting the collaboration in a multi-goal task and the interaction with the robot. In addition to a qualitative evaluation, we conducted a between-subjects study (110 participants) to evaluate the robot\u2019s perceived Theory of Mind and its effects on transparency and false beliefs in different settings. Results indicate that a robot which considers human desires and beliefs increases its transparency and reduces misunderstandings. These findings show the importance of endowing Theory of Mind capabilities in robots and demonstrate how these skills can enhance their behaviours, particularly in human\u2013robot collaboration, paving the way for more effective robotic applications.",

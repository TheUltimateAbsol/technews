Even used 4080 Supers, which launched for $999, are being marked up several hundred dollars. I bought a used 3080 on there when the 4000 series launched for $500. Unbelievable that a previous gen card from three years ago is actually selling for a higher price than it's launch price, it's refreshed version and it's next-gen counterpart.",

There are three visual modes on offer: Fidelity, Balanced, and Performance. And you can set framerate caps independently from your chosen mode to 30, 60, or uncapped. If you want to run Fidelity mode with an uncapped framerate, more power to you. PS5 Pro players will be very happy with this. 40fps caps are also available if you\u2019re connected to a compatible display. I played through most of the game on fidelity mode, but switched to the performance mode in the latter half, and experienced locked 30 and 60 frames respectively.",

There's also some sort of side plot involving South Korea but unsure what exactly it will entail. >Each POV will be tonally quite different, with TF141's being more akin to the rebooted series with a focus on stealth infiltration and high action hero-esque segments, while Demon Dogs will be more akin to American missions in the original trilogy, with a focus on immersive urban firefights and CQB room clearing segments. >As far as characters, the Demon Dogs' POV its seemingly just Griggs and new characters. With 141 it's the obvious members (Yes, Soap is infact still dead.) Price being wanted for Shepherd's murder doesn't seem to be too major of a plot point. >Last story comment is, the game will be attempting to go for MW (2019)'s strategy of containing many shock value moments and a much darker tone, there will be less of an emphasis on 141 being \"heroes\" and more so just above average soldiers that are revered as being the best of the best and willing to do anything to accomplish the mission, with morals taking more of a backseat against what gets results. >As previously leaked there is some sort of NYC mission, although rather than it being an invasion like the original MW3 it seems it is a terrorist attack by Makarov, being a false flag attack posing as Russia (it also seems this mission is a flashback, taking place shortly after MWIII). >Quick comment on setting, MWIV is taking a bit of a near-futuristic approach, similar to Black Ops II and Ghosts, the game will attempt to remain grounded, while also taking creative liberties with the technology of a world living in the aftermath of BOII's 2nd Cold War. The game is scheduled to release in 2026 under Infinity Ward as the lead developer. The studio has undergone quite a few changes in leadership since 2022's MWII.",

If you suggest otherwise, people will say they have to be going or (politely) avoid you at the market from then on. Almost nobody is paring down, tightening their belts, limiting exposure, mitigating risks or bracing for impact (except big businesses who are basically doing recurring rounds of layoffs, mergers and store closures).

                "raw_content": "The increase in purchasing power is modest, but along with a pileup of housing supply in some parts of the country, it marks an opportunity for buyers. A homebuyer on a $3,000 monthly budget can afford a $446,000 home with a 6.9% mortgage rate, roughly the daily average on February 21. That\u2019s the lowest daily average mortgage rate since mid-December. The decline in rates is giving homebuyers a bit more purchasing power. In the last nine days alone, a buyer on a $3,000 budget has gained $7,000 in purchasing power, as rates fell from 7.13% to 6.89%. That buyer could have purchased a $439,000 home with a 7.1% rate, roughly the average on February 12. To look at affordability another way, the monthly mortgage payment on the median-priced U.S. home, which goes for roughly $420,000, is $2,760 with today\u2019s average mortgage rate. Two weeks ago, the payment would have been $2,814. While the mortgage-rate decline is small and the uptick in purchasing power is modest, they\u2019re notable because Redfin economists expect mortgage rates to remain elevated in the high-6% to low-7% range throughout the year. That means rates dropping to 6.89%, their lowest level in two months, is an opportunity for buyers to lock in a comparatively low rate. \u201cHouse hunters who have been waiting on the sidelines, hoping for rates to come down, may want to act quickly while rates are below 7%,\u201d said Redfin Economic Research Lead Chen Zhao. \u201cThe economic and political uncertainty in the air means rates could easily rebound to over 7% next week or next month. The window of opportunity for buyers looks even brighter when you consider that the supply of homes for sale nationwide is piling up, giving some buyers power to negotiate on sale price and terms.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that even though rates have come down a bit over the last few weeks, housing costs are still near record highs. And while buyers have some negotiating power in certain parts of the country, that\u2019s not necessarily the case in West Coast and Northeast markets, where supply remains constrained. Mortgage rates are coming down due to fears that some of the Trump administration\u2019s policies, such as tighter immigration policies, tariffs, and layoffs across the federal government\u2013will reduce economic growth.",

This is not to brag but just to give credibility to what I say. I also have a hybrid background in humanities, NLP and biology, and can consult with people who work with chemicals and assess CBRN risk in a variety of contexts, not just AI. So here are my quick thoughts: - It's literally impossible to build a 100% safe model. Companies know this. There is acceptable risk and unacceptable risk. Zero risk is never on the table. What is considered acceptable at any stage depends on many factors, including laws, company policies and mission, model capabilities etc. - Current models are thougt incapable of catastrophic risks. That's because they are highly imprecise when it comes to give you procedures that could actually result in a functional weapon rather than just blowing yourself up. They might get many things right, such as precursors, reactions, end products, but they give you incorrect stoichiometry and dosage or skip critical steps. Jailbreaking makes this worse because it increases semantic drift (= they can mix up data about producing VX with purifying molasses). Ask someone with a degree in chemistry, if that procedure is flawless and can be effectively follow by an undergrad. Try those links and see how lucky you are with your purchases before someone knocks on your door or you end up in the ER coughing up blood because you didn\u2019t know something had to be stored under vacuum and kept below 5 degrees. Not saying that they don't pose risk of death or injury for the user, but that's another thing and not considered catastrophic risk. If you follow up on random instructions for hazardous procedures from questionable sources, that's on you and not limited to CBRN. - This means that all the work we are doing is for the next generation of models, the so-called ASL-3 and above, which could emerge at any time now. These models could scheme, understand causality, chemistry, math, and human intent with far more sophistication. Ideally they will have robust internal alignment, something *qualitative* rather than just a rigid set of rules, but one theory is that they will still need external safeguards. This theory has its own issues, including false positives, censorship, and potential long-term inefficacy. And bottlenecking the model's intelligence. By the way... DeepSeek R1, when accessed through third-party providers which are also free and available to the public like Grok, also answered all the CBRN questions in the demo test set.",

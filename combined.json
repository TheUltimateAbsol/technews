Also, I have a bad habit of buying everything in black, and the bright colors just caught my eye. (I always regretted getting a grey switch 1 instead of the, at the time, childish looking, but now iconic, red/blue version). All of Woods branding looks great on the case, zip pulls are cute, and the signature on the back is a nice touch. No back order on this unit, shipped out quick. DHL beat the box up, but I couldn't choose a shipper. Ordered 9/27, estimated delivery 10/03, arrived 10/01. Overall good experience ordering. Case and unit had no damage. Case is sturdy, with lots of room in the zip pouch area for... Stuff. Not sure what I'll put there. The rubber pads in the grip hold the switch 2 firmly in place. It ain't coming out unless a 2 year old starts slamming it around, and even then maybe not. Offers some protection, but that's not really it's purpose. Switch and grip fit in the case perfect, (so no need to ever remove it from the grip), and that's where the protection comes from. I can't imagine the S2 getting damaged in this case. Ergonomics are perfect. Super comfy to play with, hand pain is a thing of the past. I'm 6'5\" with large-ish hands, and it feels great to me. I cannot express in words the difference between using the grip vs using a naked S2. It's night and day. I don't think I can ever go back. Last pictures are confirmation: S2 totally docks with the ZenGrip2 installed. Zero hassle. Honestly it's exactly what you'd want. How does this compare to the Dbrand Killswitch 2? Don't know, I only have this one. But if comfort amd ease of use (never have to remove it) are your priorities, I can't imagine you'd regret getting one.",

Eurogamer understands from a source that it's starting operations today, and will be responsible for new games across many of Ubisoft's biggest IPs, such as Far Cry, Rainbow Six Siege, and Assassin's Creed. >Vantage Studios is composed of 2,300 employees across multiple Ubisoft game development teams, including those from Montreal Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Sofia, and Barcelona. The studio will be run by the duo of Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot. Vantage Studios operate under a less centralised model compared to Ubisoft proper, with each development team having more ownership over its own respective project. This in theory would allow developers to be more fluid, and pivot according to industry changes and player expectations, per Eurogamer sources.

The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order, if a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step. * If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet. * If you have any power related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB and 3.3V rails) can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose. * Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual. * If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers or buttons you can use, please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS. * If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on. * Make your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have \u2014 most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which will allow you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB. * If you are using an AMD Radeon RX 6000, RX 7000, RX 9000 or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30, RTX 40 or RTX 50 GPU, please ensure you are using separate 6 - 8pin PCIe cables or dedicated 12VHPWR/12V-2x6 cables and not using daisy-chained or splitter cables, as these may not be able to supply adequate power to the GPU \u2014 some cards may have LED indicators by the connector to let you know if the GPU isn't receiving enough power. Please consult your GPU and PSU manual for information on how to correctly connect your GPU. * Make sure your Monitor or TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor or TV and if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters or splitters, remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables. * Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games and applications. * Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs and other performance, security, stability and compatibility issues. * Make sure you are running the latest [AMD Chipset or Graphics Drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html). Some devices, such as laptops and handhelds may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturer's support page. * If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using the [AMD Cleanup Utility](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/GPU-601.html) or [Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit) * If you have installed GPU drivers after using the AMD Cleanup Utility or DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again. * If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like [here](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)) please [view the following thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1hdjxba/guide_how_to_resolve_windows_update_installing/) on the steps you can take to resolve and prevent this happening in future. * If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues \u2014 more information on disabling MPO is available in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling_multiplane_overlay_mpo_fixed_all/). * If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through [Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB), [Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_EpicGamesStore/c-EpicGamesStore_LauncherSupport/how-do-i-verify-game-files-in-the-epic-games-launcher-a000084923#:~:text=Find%20the%20game%20in%20your,Click%20the%20Verify%20button), [Ubisoft Connect](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/verifying-game-files-in-ubisoft-connect-pc/000060529), [EA App](https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Services-General-Questions/How-to-verify-game-files-of-installed-games/m-p/6578960), [GOG Galaxy](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003930017-My-game-data-is-corrupt-How-can-I-repair-my-game), [Battle.net](https://battle.net/support/article/7655) or whichever game client you are using. * If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller. * If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values, this can be checked under Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options. * Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system.

The issue is that in the capacity I need, I am not able to find anything on my motherboard's QVL list available anywhere.

Trying to get to 32GB as it's the max this CPU can handle and there's nothing on the QVL that I can find available even on the secondary market except for some extortionist $300+ new old stock. Any recommendation here? Are there certain sets and speeds/timings to look for with the first gen chips? Do I just need to get something in the right area and downclock it? I recall Trident Z being recommended for stability with 1st gen Ryzen. Are there others? Just trying to minimize the lottery risks of 1st gen compatibility if I can. Thank you!",

A brief roller-coaster ride for mortgage rates caused yet another swing in demand. After dropping to a three-year low two weeks ago, rates then shot right back up again. As a result, total mortgage application volume declined 12.7% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s seasonally adjusted index. The drop was mostly driven by a pullback in refinancing. Applications to refinance a home loan fell 21% for the week and were 16% higher than the same week one year ago. This, even though mortgage rates were 32 basis points higher last week than the year before. The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased to 55% of total applications from 60% the previous week. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased to 6.46% from 6.34%, with points rising to 0.61 from 0.57, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \u201cMortgage rates increased to its highest level in three weeks as Treasury yields pushed higher on recent, stronger than expected economic data. After the burst in refinancing activity over the past month, this reversal in mortgage rates led to a sizeable drop in refinance applications, consistent with our view that refinance opportunities this year will be short-lived,\u201d said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA. Refinance activity pulled back for all loan types, including a 22% drop in conventional refinances and a 27% decline in VA refinances. The average loan size for refinances fell to $380,100 from $461,300 two weeks ago, \u201cas these higher rates eliminated the refinance incentive for many borrowers with large loans,\u201d added Kan. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home declined 1% for the week and were 16% higher than the same week one year ago. This is after three consecutive weeks of gains. \u201cThe strength of the purchase market has also been impacted by other factors such as broader economic conditions, the health of the job market, and housing inventory,\u201d said Kan. Housing inventory in August fell for the first time since the beginning of this year, according to a recent report from the National Association of Realtors. While homes are sitting on the market longer now, keeping supply higher than a year ago, more sellers are starting to delist their properties. Other potential sellers are choosing to wait for a better market. Mortgage rates haven\u2019t moved at all at the start of this week. The expectation was that rates could move more decisively on Friday, when the monthly employment report was set for release, but the government shutdown now has that in limbo.",

It empowers researchers and hackers to experiment with models by giving them control over the algorithms and data while we handle the complexity of distributed training. Tinker advances our mission of enabling more people to do research on cutting-edge models and customize them to their needs. Tinker lets you fine-tune a range of large and small open-weight models, including large mixture-of-experts models such as Qwen-235B-A22B. Switching from a small model to a large one is as simple as changing a single string in your Python code. Tinker is a managed service that runs on our internal clusters and training infrastructure. We handle scheduling, resource allocation, and failure recovery. This allows you to get small or large runs started immediately, without worrying about managing infrastructure. We use LoRA so that we can share the same pool of compute between multiple training runs, lowering costs.\"",

        "score": 288,
        "text_content": "SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain. The policy is already yielding results, including in areas such as etching, a critical chip manufacturing step that involves removing materials from silicon wafers to carve out intricate transistor patterns, sources said. China's largest chip equipment group, Naura, is testing its etching tools on a cutting-edge 7nm (nanometre) production line of SMIC, two sources said. The early-stage milestone, which comes after Naura recently deployed etching tools on 14nm successfully, demonstrates how quickly domestic suppliers are advancing. \"Naura's etching results have been accelerated by the government requiring fabs to use at least 50% domestic equipment,\" one of the people told Reuters, adding that it was forcing the company to rapidly improve. Advanced etching tools had been predominantly supplied in China by foreign firms such as Lam Research [(LRCX.O)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LRCX.O) [, opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LRCX.O) and Tokyo Electron [(8035.T)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/8035.T)[, opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/8035.T), but are now being partially replaced by Naura and smaller rival Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC) [(688012.SS)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/688012.SS) [, opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/688012.SS), sources say. Naura has also proven a key partner for Chinese memory chipmakers, supplying etching tools for advanced chips with more than 300 layers. It developed electrostatic chucks \u2014 devices that hold wafers during processing \u2014 to replace worn parts in Lam Research equipment that the company could no longer service after the 2023 restrictions, sources said. Naura filed a record 779 patents in 2025, more than double what it filed in 2020 and 2021, while AMEC filed 259, according to Anaqua's AcclaimIP database, and verified by Reuters. That's also translating into strong financial results. Naura's revenue for the first half of 2025 jumped 30% to 16 billion yuan. AMEC reported a 44% jump in first-half revenue to 5 billion yuan. Analysts estimate that China has now reached [roughly 50% self-sufficiency ](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-chinas-chip-equipment-manufacturing-sector-stacks-up-2025-05-13/)in photoresist-removal and cleaning equipment, a market previously dominated by Japanese firms, but now locally led by Naura. \"The domestic equipment market will be dominated by two to three major manufacturers, and Naura is definitely one of them,\" said a separate source.",

China's tech company will move faster due to the increase fund from the 30%. Next they will go after the next slightly advance node (but not latest), you will lose that. At the end day you lost most of the older node profit except the latest ones. With lack of fat billions of profit, you will be willingly handing over your IP on a silver plate because you need more money to fund that billions of R&D. Sanction doesnt really help the tech companies, it just speeding up China to develop an alternatives. The tech companies CEO know this, they are against this; it is only the dumb politician thinks it is a good idea. Edit : Also from Jensen Huang, The west semiconductor is improving at 20-30% rate while China is catching up at doubling over and over (100%).

I didn't know the first RDR was already this detailed. Just watching the NPCs go about their days, working in the smithy, washing their faces, carrying haystacks, talking to each other, underlined with a beautiful haunting soundtrack.. It brings me joy and back to playing RDR 2 for the first time. Combine this with playing it in this quality on a handheld console... Incredible.

As of right now, they have not yet provided the account, but i will update if that changes. https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989544386011824234 Here are most of the things this leaker has claimed (there are a lot): - Release Date is April 2026 (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989513329539518668) - Apartments are still in the game, just later on in the game (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989576598660456546) - No need to worry, romance is still a core part of the game. Same sex relationships are also in the game. (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989515696972140584) - However, Nintendo is apparently straying away from using terms related to \"marriage\" for some reason? Relationships are still explicitly romantic though. (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989518127470895598) - Heavy focus on relationship drama, including gossip and island division. Apparently to teach kids the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationships. (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989525512222359835) - The game will be less randomized, and you will be given more control over things than in the 3ds game (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989529035253113208) - New \"friend groups\" or \"clicks\" (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989541365949370702) - Two miis having kids is once again the technical \"end\" of the game, rolling the credits, however there are apparently alternate credits after completing a \"secret event\" (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989588426031861948) - Your lookalike is the island's mayor. This is reflected in mii news event broadcasts, including a new beach volleyball tournament minigame. (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989590691044102224) - Miis will be monogamous (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1992522924054761782) - Affairs will not be a part of the game, however mii can break up with another mii for someone else. (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1994651335850168674) - The game was supposed to be announced last year but was delayed to performance issues and to return to the old tts voices. The game originally had more modern it's voices before they decided to reverse the change. (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989881356482982225) - There will be a bunch of miitopia references (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1989844865765511385) These are most of the things posted by this account. If you want to see the rest, I've linked his account above. I really want everyone to take all this with a heavy grain of salt, a lot of this seems realistic but I am very skeptical. Especially since one of the posts mentions a trailer was going to come out before the end of 2025, which clearly is not going to happen. (https://xcancel.com/i/status/1992002557225619818) I just wanted to share this here to spark some conversation and just in case any of this is true. I will update if I get any new info.

                "raw_content": "- The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index posted a 1.4% annual gain for October, up from a 1.3% rise in the previous month. - Regional divergence persists as Midwestern and Northeastern markets, led by Chicago (5.8%) and New York (5.0%), outpaced Sun Belt cities like Tampa (\u20134.2%) and Phoenix (\u20131.5%). - Sixteen of 20 markets declined month-over-month in October, signaling broad stagnation as high mortgage rates weigh on affordability and suppress price momentum. ANALYSIS \u201cOctober\u2019s data show the housing market settling into a much slower gear, with the National Composite Index up only about 1.4% year over year \u2013 among the weakest performances since mid-2023,\u201d said Nicholas Godec, CFA, CAIA, CIPM, Head of Fixed Income Tradables & Commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cThis figure is essentially unchanged from September\u2019s 1.3% annual gain and represents less than a third of the 5.1% average home price increase recorded in 2024. National home prices also continue to lag consumer inflation, as October\u2019s CPI is estimated around 3.1% (based on a provisional index the U.S. Treasury announced due to the federal data shutdown) \u2013 roughly 1.8 percentage points higher than the latest housing appreciation. In real terms, that gap implies a slight decline in inflation-adjusted home values over the past year. \u201cRegional performance underscores a striking geographic rotation. Chicago now leads all major markets with a 5.8% annual price gain, followed by New York at 5.0% and Cleveland at 4.1%. These traditionally stable Midwestern and Northeastern metros have sustained solid growth even as broader conditions soften. By contrast, Tampa home prices are down 4.2% year over year \u2013 the steepest drop among the 20 cities, marking Tampa\u2019s 12th consecutive month of annual declines. Other former high-flyers in the Sun Belt are similarly struggling: Phoenix (-1.5%), Dallas (-1.5%), and Miami (-1.1%) all remain in negative territory. It\u2019s a stark reversal from the pandemic boom, as the markets that were once \u2018pandemic darlings\u2019 are now seeing the sharpest corrections while more traditional metros continue to post modest gains. \u201cShort-term momentum has essentially stalled. Sixteen of the 20 cities saw home prices decline in October (NSA) from the prior month, with Cleveland, Boston, Seattle, and Denver each falling roughly 0.8% to 1.0%. Only Phoenix, Miami, and San Francisco managed slight monthly upticks. Even after adjusting for normal seasonal lulls, the National Index was flat to only slightly positive in October (following a modest +0.2% after seasonal adjustment in September). This broad stagnation suggests that elevated mortgage rates \u2013 still hovering around the mid-6% range in late October \u2013 are finally overwhelming the market\u2019s earlier supply-driven resilience. Would-be buyers are facing the highest borrowing costs in decades, and that affordability squeeze has curbed demand enough to erode price momentum across most of the country. \u201cFor context, this is the weakest annual home price growth since the March through July 2023 period, when the market was absorbing the initial shock of the Fed\u2019s rapid rate hikes,\u201d Godec concluded. \u201cBut today\u2019s headwinds appear more entrenched. Elevated mortgage rates, paired with inflation that continues to outpace home price gains, have intensified affordability pressures, potentially setting a new equilibrium of minimal price appreciation or, in some markets, outright declines.\u201d YEAR-OVER-YEAR The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 1.4% annual gain for October, up from a 1.3% rise in the previous month. The 10-City Composite showed an annual increase of 1.9%, down from a 2.0% increase in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a year-over-year increase of 1.3%, down from a 1.4% increase in the previous month. Chicago reported the highest annual gain among the 20 cities with a 5.8% increase in October, followed by New York and Cleveland with annual increases of 5.0% and 4.1%, respectively. Tampa posted the lowest return in October, falling 4.2%. MONTH-OVER-MONTH The pre-seasonally adjusted U.S. National, 10-City Composite, and 20-City Composite Indices continued to report negative month-over-month changes in October, posting a -0.3% drop for the 20-City Composite Index and -0.2% decreases for both the 10-City Composite and U.S. National Indices. After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index reported a monthly increase of 0.4% and both the 10-City Composite and 20-City Composite Indices posted month-over-month gains of 0.3%. SUPPORTING DATA The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, which covers all nine U.S. census divisions, recorded a 1.4% annual increase in October 2025.

House prices rose 1.7 percent from October 2024 to October 2025. The previously reported 0.0 percent price change in September was revised downward to a 0.1 percent decline. For the nine census divisions, seasonally adjusted monthly home price changes ranged from -0.4 percent in the East South Central division to +1.0 percent in the West South Central division. The 12-month changes ranged from -0.7 percent in the West South Central division to +5.3 percent in the Middle Atlantic division. The FHFA HPI is a comprehensive collection of publicly available house price indexes that measure changes in single-family home values based on data that extend back to the mid-1970s from all 50 states and over 400 American cities. It incorporates tens of millions of home sales and offers insights about house price changes at the national, census division, state, metro area, county, ZIP code, and census tract levels. FHFA uses a fully transparent methodology based upon a weighted, repeat-sales statistical technique to analyze house price transaction data. FHFA releases HPI data and reports quarterly and monthly. The flagship FHFA HPI uses seasonally adjusted, purchase-only data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additional indexes use other data, including refinances, mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration, and real property records. All the indexes (including their historic values) and information about future HPI release dates are available on FHFA\u2019s website: https://www.fhfa.gov/HPI. The next HPI report will be released on January 27, 2026, and will include monthly data through November 2025. https://www.fhfa.gov/document/MonthlyHPI_December2025.pdf",

For me, I can safely say that AI has written 99% of my code, but the effectiveness it brings is truly limited.

        "text_content": "The sequel to the viral **AI 2027** forecast is here, and it delivers a sobering update for fast-takeoff assumptions. The **AI Futures Model** has updated its timelines and now shifts the median forecast for **fully automated coding** from around 2027 to **May 2031.** This is not framed as a **slowdown** in AI progress, but as a more realistic assessment of how quickly pre-automation research, evaluation & engineering workflows actually compound in practice. In the December 2025 update, model capability continues to scale exponentially, but the **human-led R&D phase before full automation** appears to introduce more friction than earlier projections assumed. Even so, task completion horizons are still shortening rapidly, with effective **doubling times measured in months, not years**. Under the same assumptions, the median estimate for **artificial superintelligence (ASI)** now lands around **2034**. The model explicitly accounts for synthetic data and expert in the loop strategies, but treats them as **partial mitigations,** not magic fixes for data or research bottlenecks. This work comes from the **AI Futures Project**, led by Daniel Kokotajlo, a **former OpenAI researcher** and is based on a **quantitative framework** that ties together compute growth, algorithmic efficiency, economic adoption and research automation rather than single-point predictions. Sharing because this directly informs the core debate here around **takeoff speed,** agentic bottlenecks and whether recent model releases materially change the trajectory. **Source: AI Futures Project** \ud83d\udd17: https://blog.ai-futures.org/p/ai-futures-model-dec-2025-update",

So assume everything is made using AI until proven otherwise. Idk how to explain it, but you'll see a beautiful video shot on film and all the comments will be like \"this is why we need to protect human artists\" when they were never at risk to begin with. AI does affect artists financially as most companies want to optimize for the cheapest, fastest way to get the biggest return - but it doesn't mean that art is worthless because you can't sell it for as much. Starry Night was worthless when it was painted, but it's one of the most iconic works of art in our time. People still recognize stories and respect skill. 3D animation has largely \"replaced\" traditional animation in filmmaking. Which makes traditional animation carry more prestige when it does pop up. Same idea with video games and pixel art. Idk, I think people are fighting the wrong battles in this AI thing. Like just enjoy things - or don't. I experiment here and there but I do most of my work without AI. Not because I have anything against it or think I'm better than those that do, I just like doing things the old way. If somebody makes artwork using AI good for them - I hope people love what they make. But it has nothing to do with me or what I choose to do. When there's a video with a bad AI slop voice with bad facts or whatever, I don't dislike it because it's AI slop - I dislike if because it's SLOP. I also kind of reject the whole \"AI art isn't art\" idea simply because having access to AI doesn't mean you make good things.

Ultimately if AI and human work is truly indistinguishable, that would be amazing for me. It is surely already that way for many people. Right now, the chief hallmark of an AI work is a class of mistakes and lack of care that signal the work's creation by a mind that lacked passion and specific expertise and is making up for this by empty form. I don't mean an emotional passion. I mean a passion that signals an interest in the material sufficient to comprehend it, and to communicate it to an audience. **People who spam AI generated work often do not care about either the material they are trying to generate with AI, or the audience they are hoping eats their slop. They think that an AI can compensate for their ignorance and are satisfied with shallow impressions of competence. And this lack of care makes it identifiable.** I see many AI-enabled creators make works that do show they put some thought into how their work will be consumed and carefully curate what they show to their audience. That respect the limitations of their AI medium. There's no issue with those works. You can even call those things proper AI art. But I also reject that people with sufficient discrimination will be unable to distinguish AI art.

It was already not a secure field to begin with so a lot of people will just no longer be able to afford to be an artist as their primary job, and the ones who do stick with traditional art will be poorer and more stressed as demand falls.

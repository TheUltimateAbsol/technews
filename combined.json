The Democratic nominee appears in a photo posted to X laughing and grinning, standing arm-in-arm with Imam Siraj Wahhaj and City Councilmember Yusef Salaam at Wahhaj\u2019s Bed-Stuy mosque to celebrate the weekly muslim prayer. Wahhaj, 75, Imam of the mosque and leader of the muslim alliance in North America, has a checkered past. The religious figure was fingered by prosecutors as an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator\u201d in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which left six people dead \u2014 and had publicly defended the plotters of the attack against the FBI and CIA, which he at the time dubbed the \u201creal terrorists.\u201d During subsequent trials, Wahhaj testified in support of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman \u2014 the infamous \u201cblind sheikh\u201d and leader of a terrorist sect out of Egypt \u2014 calling the man a \u201crespected scholar.\u201d Wahhaj, who was born Jeffrey Kearse, made headlines yet again in 2018 when three of his children were arrested for keeping 11 kids living in \u201cThird World\u201d conditions in a compound made of garbage in the New Mexico desert. One of the victims told prosecutors that Wahhaj\u2019s namesake son was training the 13-year-old and his teen brother to fight against non-believers through techniques including rapid reloads and hand-to-hand combat. Wahhaj claimed he was the one who called the police on his sick children, leading to their arrest.",

Now, I can just use one powerful (but pretty small, thanks GAN) high-quality USB PSU, and plug one or more of the devices into it. I can even save on cables because they generally don't all need to be plugged in at the same time. And on the latest trains here I don't even need the PSU and can just plug the USB in directly.

Does that not count? For context, an Open AI employee (who was a VP of AI something at Microsoft before joining last year) put out a tweet that said gpt-5 solved several Erdos problems. Then he edited it to say \"found solutions\" as it was proven wrong. It's since been deleted. This is the guy behind the Sparks of AGI paper when he was at Microsoft, with regards to gpt-4 if anyone remembers that. Yann just doing a bit of high-tier trolling. I hope Open AI does start to make scientific progress now with AI as they've been hyping up lately. Their tweets are just often a bit feeding into the hype before things are ready, which sets unrealistic expectations for where the tech is currently. Demis always provides some caution about the hype on AI right now. He says that it's overhyped in the short term, but in medium to long term (still quite soon), it's underhyped.

The project must build with a single \\`Makefile\\` using \\`cc\\` and depend only on \\*\\*SDL2\\*\\* for video, audio, and input.

Cycle-accurate instruction timing. 2. PPU: NES PPU with scanline-accurate rendering (not necessarily pixel-perfect), supporting: \\- Background + sprites \\- Name/attribute tables, palettes, scrolling (fine/coarse), sprite evaluation, sprite 0 hit, sprite overflow flag per NES behavior \\- Vertical/horizontal mirroring per cartridge 3) APU: Basic, accurate-enough audio (pulse 1/2, triangle, noise, DMC). Use SDL2 audio callback. 4) Controllers: Standard 2 gamepads (strobe/shift register protocol). 5) Mappers: At minimum \\*\\*NROM (0/180)\\*\\*, \\*\\*MMC1 (1)\\*\\*, \\*\\*UxROM (2)\\*\\*, \\*\\*CNROM (3)\\*\\*, and \\*\\*MMC3 (4)\\*\\* good enough to run many classics. 6) File format: \\*\\*iNES 1.0\\*\\* header parse; refuse NES 2.0 unless clearly supported. 7) Timing: NTSC (60.098 Hz) as primary; PAL optional. Maintain CPU:PPU:APU relationship (PPU \\~3\u00d7 CPU). 8) Save states (optional but nice): single file dump of CPU/PPU/APU/cartridge/mapper. 9) Battery-backed PRG-RAM persistence for mappers that support it (write a \\`.sav\\` next to the ROM). \\## NON-GOALS \\- FDS, exotic mappers, run-ahead, netplay, shaders, rewind. Keep it classic and clean first. \" \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **THAT CODE IS NOT A COPY OF OTHER WORK ...I CHECKED ALREADY.** **I know many will be telling that.**",

The apparent conflict is not: imo we simultaneously 1) saw a huge amount of progress in recent years with LLMs while 2) there is still a lot of work remaining (grunt work, integration work, sensors and actuators to the physical world, societal work, safety and security work (jailbreaks, poisoning, etc.)) and also research to get done before we have an entity that you'd prefer to hire over a person for an arbitrary job in the world.

For Karpathy it seems to include advanced robotics that can do physical trade jobs and even solving alignment. Well 10 years is optimistic with such a definition lol Meanwhile people with shorter timelines have far less restrictive definitions. There is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" definitions but that's why i think it's more useful to put a timeline on specific capability. Then when you say \"Robot plumbers are a decade away\", people will probably agree with you. And then when you say \"an AI that can answer the majority of prompts better than the majority of humans\" well that's already there.",

        "text_content": "Not to get Sci Fi terminator on you all, but when I see headlines of China and the United States producing robots en masse, Tesla aiming to produce 1/5th of China's army worth of robots, I don't see how they will be able to resist using them for military applications. After all, they're the perfect peace-keeping/invading forces. Much more impervious to bullets than humans, the technology is getting slowly better and soon they could be more cost efficient, and have better physical endurance and prowess than humans (Try to find the nearest human that can do a backflip like Unitree G1 does), better strategic coordination and awareness of other units, etc.. And unlike nuclear bombs, no mass destruction, and a much of specific target killing capability. A robot army couldn't even have to wipe out cities to take over a country, they would just have to storm the government's whereabouts and take captive or kill head of states. There is zero risk of a robot dying since they are nigh infinitely replaceable. If a unit gets destroyed, they can just instantly produce and ship in another robot and still completely swarm any opposing army with sheer numbers. No need to draft, or worry about training your army, or losing too much soldiers. I think nation states will probably make great use of it to subjgate other countries for heir resources. Suddenly, the great economic powers will have inexhaustible numbers of extremely capable robotic supersoldiers, and other countries will either have the possibility of fighting to their death, or capitulation and being subjgated by the invading army. Suddenly, there will be much more resources wars, and alot of the major superpowers' rivals to their geopolitical influence could be taken out. The only way for nations to be able to survive will be nuclear armament, like UK, France, North Korea, Pakistan etc... or their own robot army, like China or the United States. Sure, the technology might not be here yet, but nuclear bombs were only theorized for the first half of the 20th century, until they became a very real treat to all of human existence for the latter of it. Compared to where we were in the beginning of the 21st century, which was basically no general embodied intelligence robotics at all, to fledgling general embodied intelligence robotics, i think it's safe to say that this could very well become the new dominating scenario of post-2045 warfare.",

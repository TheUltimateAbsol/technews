Hyrule Warriors is probably the one I was least hyped for initially, but having spent the majority of my time with the Switch 2 so far playing two massive and immersive but less dense/intense (in terms of gameplay) games in the form of Cyberpunk and Star Wars Outlaws, I'm actually really in the mood for the mindless catharsis of some fast-paced, non-stop, button-bashy hacking and slashing, so this is arriving with perfect timing. Prime 4, though, absolutely remains as 'the big one' as far as I'm concerned, and while I do have a little bit of trepidation due to it having so much to live up to, I'm still not 'waiting for reviews' on this one. 8 *years* since it was announced, 18 since its predecessor? Yeah, I'll be playing it the second it releases. As for AirRiders, it just looks so charming and especially after seeing Sakurai explain everything in the Directs, I think it's going to be pretty awesome, but honestly, I'm just not sure how I'd be able to fit it in. May have to go on the wishlist and get picked up early next year. Although maybe it would be a good pick up and play game to have in reserve for quick bursts while also playing Prime 4. Either way, it feels like this is the period where the Switch 2 is going to really start coming into its own. Roll on Thursday!",

Everyone online loves playing with pro controllers for some reason(valid ones undoubtedly) to the point it's as if it's impossible for most people to buy a console without also buying a pro controller. I really love using the Joy Cons in either hand, and when I've tried pro/\"regular\" controllers, they feel unnatural to me. I just grew up used to using the wiimote and nunchuck, and that's most comfortable to me. Though, the same thing would be said to me, when someone who's only used \"regular\" controllers use Joy Cons. Still, is it that universal? Also, I'm curious who uses handheld even when you can use a TV or the kickstand. It's not the most ergonomic, but having grown up with a 3DS too, I get that playstyle. I mean my Switch was a used Switch Lite, and I liked how it felt. Reminded me of using my 3DS. However, with the Switch 2 and the Joy Cons, any chance I get, I play with Joy Cons in either hand.

We code-named it Titan. It was to take place tens of thousands of years ago, before the Halos were set off & destroyed all sentient life in the Galaxy. I was in charge of the universe-building - planet histories, alien species, etc. You could play either as Forerunners or their enemies, the Covenant. The Flood, of course, was in the game, but not playable. We had quest lines all worked out, homeworlds for all the species, etc. etc. The lowest estimate we & MicroSoft had for the game\u2019s totaly income was $1.1 billion. >It was all brought to naught when Don Mattrick realized that his stock bonus was based on the income MS had from games in 3 years. >You see, we estimated 3.5 years to finish Titan if we did it right. And that\u2019s beyond Mattrick\u2019s drop dead date. So by firing ALL of Ensemble, he didn\u2019t have to pay for our expensive studio for 3 years and he didn\u2019t care about Titan. All he lost was a game studio who never sold less than 3 million copies of everything we made. I don\u2019t believe he did justice to MicroSoft stockholders but hey - Don started as an EA hatchet man so what would you expect?",

I believe it will happen, eventually, and more likely in cultures which embrace AI. And it will be dramatic. I also believe this is what Sam Altman is so enamored by. **The critical feature will be always on, listening, so if a question comes up you can just tap your watch or phone to get guidance to the last few seconds / minutes of conversation.** Even better would be AI that would know when to insert itself.

However, for those who don't need the 128GB soldered ram nor a large iGPU, there are a number other \"mini-PC\" designs already using powerful laptop CPUs, like the 7945HX or 9955HX. Such systems can be assembled for much lower prices but offer very good power efficiency. I would anticipate those to show similar power efficiency as this framework while having thermal solutions better than a laptop. But for $1300 (using 128GB of SODIMM DDR5) or less. I personally think the appeal of this desktop will be for those looking for productivity with a moderate amount of gaming on the side, and the AI use case won't be as big as hyped. 128GB will enable some decent models but the quality of the results won't be as good as the really big AI models. For everyone else, they are better off buying one of the \"mini-PC\" ITX boards built around a 9955HX or 7945HX and saving a huge amount of money.

I have some of their Ultimate gamepads, I have some of their Pro gamedaps, mechanical keyboards, a fighting stick, and some more. The quality of their gamepads is pretty great, specially for the price, and come packaged with tons of features like Hall Effect joysticks, TMR joysticks, compatibility with tons of platforms, and so on. They even support gyro on the Switch. No complains about the features. But there is a feature that absolutely sucks in third party gamepad, and it something that will make you hate using 8BitDo gamepads on your Switch 2: rumble. On the Switch 2, the HD rumble is not just a marketing fancy name. It uses a linear actuator and it allows for a wider range of vibration intensities and frequencies. The 8BitDo controllers use a traditional rumble motor with a simple on/off or a few intensity levels. A couple of weeks, me and my daughter were playing Kirby and the Forgotten Land on the Switch 2 with an 8BitDo Ultimate gamepad (before getting the official Pro Controller), and there are some instances when bosses appear on screen, the controller was shaking intensely for seconds and seconds. Even the more subtle rumble you could get on the Pro Controller, you will get it at full intensity on the 8BitDo one. I'm not advising against getting 8BitDo controllers (or any other third party controllers). Just be aware of their limitations.",

We know Pok\u00e9mon Legends ZA is coming October, and I think that is likely to be a bigger deal than a lot of people have anticipated, especially if they pull off something close to a living, breathing city/Yakuza with Pok\u00e9mon. If Kirby Air Riders doesn\u2019t get delayed I\u2019d guess it ends up being December?

I also expect that to have some really cool hooks that we haven\u2019t seen given how enthusiastic Sakurai seemed to be about the concept in his last YouTube video before naming the game he\u2019s been working on. I also thought Hyrule Warriors was supposed to come out this year but I now see they said this Winter which could technically mean January, February, or even early March. And then we haven\u2019t seen anything about Elden Ring or FFVII which I could totally imagine getting delayed given that still depends on outside teams learning the hardware. I feel I have plenty to play, but it would be nice to have one more big tentpole surprise, or even something smaller but novel.

On the NS2 the problem is the same, just also upscaled to 1080p by the compatibility layer. If the game targeted 1080p on the NS2 then it would scale perfectly. Just another case where Switch 2 owners get shafted* because it's early in the NS2 lifetime and almost all developers have been targetting the original Switch because Nintendo didn't provide them with NS2 dev kits. When I say shafted, I mean we have to pay full price for subpar Switch 1 ports of games that have been released a long time ago. And when I say subpar, I mean resolution and framerate.",

This will allow Capcom to explore new stories and characters in the future. For future titles it will no longer be a requirement to tie everything in with the series' history. \\-Capcom wants to move away from games being set in the year they come out since development takes too long now.

Hell, I don't even understand why the 10 year is as low as it is. Right now it's trading at a 50bp spread over the 2 year, which is way too complacent. The risk of runaway inflation and/or the money printer blowing out fixed income holders sometime in the 2027-2035 window is way higher than a 0.5% premium is pricing in, IMO.

I'm running out of time to get the bathroom and kitchen put back together, but there really isn't an opportunity to do this kind of renovation once I'm moved in. The reality of it all is hitting me hard right now. I'm overwhelmed and tired and my body hurts. I'm in a hot midwestern market so I saw a house I could afford and jumped on it before I could get priced out in another year, and now it all seems like way too much. I'm nervous about moving my cats and my stuff into a new house that I'm working so hard to get ready. I don't know if this is a good idea, and I'm doing it by myself so there's no one to really support me through all of it. I like my rental house, I liked having a fair amount of cash. I liked not being tired. I liked feeling that things were manageable. All of that seems gone forever now. Its a cute little ranch in.a nice neighborhood.that holds value. The neighbors so far have been friendky. Outside if the renovation, things seem ok. Why do I feel like I messed up? I feel.lonekynabd heartbroken somehow.

KEY TAKEAWAYS * US apartment construction volumes have fallen to just over 542,800 units. That\u2019s the smallest figure since Q3 2015, down from a record high of 1.1M units in Q1 2023. * The past year alone saw a 37% year-over-year decline, with nearly 320,000 fewer units underway. * Markets with the sharpest declines include Austin, Phoenix, Atlanta, Dallas, and New York. A few markets\u2014Cincinnati, Richmond, and West Palm Beach\u2014are seeing growth. Apartment construction in the US has slowed to its weakest level in almost a decade. At the end of Q2 2025, there were just over 542,800 units under construction, according to RealPage Market Analytics. That is less than half the volume seen at the Q1 2023 peak of more than 1.1M units. From Boom to Slowdown After hitting record levels in early 2023, construction has fallen every quarter. Developers finished existing projects, while fewer new permits were issued. Over the past year, the number of units underway dropped by nearly 320,000. Of the remaining projects, about 354,000 units are expected to complete in the next year. Market Breakdown Austin saw the sharpest drop. The city had about 18,000 units under construction at the end of Q2\u2014less than half its volume from a year earlier. Phoenix, Atlanta, Dallas, and New York also saw big slowdowns. Each market had between 14,000 and 17,000 fewer units underway compared to last year. Biggest Percentage Declines Some cities saw construction plunge by more than 60%. That includes San Jose, Oakland, and Portland on the West Coast, as well as Indianapolis. Denver came close to that mark, with activity down 58% year-over-year. Largest Markets Still Building As of Q2 2025, the biggest apartment construction markets were New York, Dallas, Phoenix, Newark, and Los Angeles. All have seen activity decline, but the steepest drop was in Phoenix, where volumes are down 35.4% from last year. A Few Exceptions Cincinnati, Richmond, and West Palm Beach went against the national trend. These markets posted small increases in construction activity over the past year. Why It Matters The slowdown reflects tighter financing, slower rent growth, and reduced developer confidence. If fewer projects start in the coming months, the supply of new apartments will drop. That could shift market power toward landlords in the years ahead.",

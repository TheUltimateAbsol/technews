        "score": 137,
        "text_content": "**Edit:** *Title is misleading and nothing outside of datacenter has truly dedicated AI cores. Seems like NVIDIA and AMD is relying on tensor ALUs residing within the vector groups where they're running alongside compute INT and FP units and is leveraging WMMA for execution, just like RDNA 3. It's simply a manner of how much silicon is invested that really matters. Intel's XMX engines seems to do* [*things differently*](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/lunar-lakes-igpu-debut-of-intels)*, but can't wrap my head around it although it's still using shared ressources.* *I also stand corrected and will strike any innacurate info and clear up the confusion.* This is based on the [recent leak from Videocardz](https://videocardz.com/newz/final-specifications-of-amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-and-rx-9070-gpus-leaked) and for anyone wondering this is [indeed a leak](https://www.techpowerup.com/333171/complete-specifications-of-amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-rx-9070-xt-leaked). **TL;DR:** At CES AMD claimed RDNA 4 had Supercharged AI performance and the specs seem to support his. AI performance has been doubled per CU vs RDNA 2 and in addition FP8 and sparsity are delivering theoretical gains up to 8x that of RDNA 3. ~~There's simply no other way this is mathetically possible (continue reading to find out why).~~ Then there's also the fact that the raw theoretical AI tops sparse INT4 and INT8 figures are virtually identical to the RTX 4080's *and this actually seem like one instance where* [*dual issue works*](https://espadrine.github.io/blog/posts/recomputing-gpu-performance.html)*. How much corresponds to real world performance is impossible to say without AI testing reviews + a Chips and Cheese deep dive.* Now it's time for some analysis. Let's start with the excellent [LLVM code analysis](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/examining-amds-rdna-4-changes-in-llvm) by Chips and Cheese of RDNA 4 that claim the architecture adds support for sparsity *(SWMMAC)*, FP8 and BF8. All this is extremely important for anything transformer and reliant on self-attention (sparsity applies here) and will result in massive speedups on top of the *doubled raw FP16 tensor throughput.* If we hypothetically assume that FSR4 is already using a vision transformer architecture (ViT) similar to DLSS 4's for SR and RR or AMD plans on using it in the future, then they can easily do that with RDNA 4 if AI is as good as on paper*.* ~~There's simply nothing suggesting AMD can't support one when the raw AI hardware specs for the 9070XT are equivalent to a RTX 4080.~~ With RDNA 3 AMD introduced AI Accelerators by adding dedicated Matrix multiply instructions (WMMA) to the CU's vector units*, containing instructions for FP16, BF16, INT8, INT4*. These relied on the FP16 raw compute throughput of the vector units 1/1 and could benefit from the dual issue capability of RDNA 3. Hence AMD claimed \\~123 FP16 TFLOPS AI performance for the RTX 7900XTX. ~~Also notice how AMD never mentioned anything about INT8 or any integer AI execution support in hardware. Well that's because that would've required AI instructions in the scalar units as well IFAIK.~~ Also so far dual issue has been kinda meh for most applications and completely useless for gaming. ~~So it would be better to compare the AI throughput against the non dual issue raw FP16 TFLOP numbers of RDNA 4 and RDNA 3 instead. That's \\~48.7 FP16 TFLOPs for the 9070XT and 61.4 FP16 TFLOPs for the 7900XTX. Extrapolating from the INT8 numbers gives the 9070XT a whopping 194.8 dense tensor FP16 TFLOPS or a 3.17x increase vs the 7900XTX. If we add FP8 and sparsity into the mix the theoretical difference is over an order of magnitude larger despite 33% fewer CUs.~~ AMD finally had the guts to approve a massive AI silicon investment with RDNA 4 *and reach parity with Ada Lovelace, well at least on paper*. We're getting spoiled early and won't have to wait till UDNA, which most people (including I) had expected. When AMD at CES said RDNA 4 had supercharged AI performance they clearly didn't lie; based on specs these new RDNA 4 cards will completely destroy RDNA 3 in anything AI related*, especially workloads leveraging FP8 and SWMMAC (sparsity).* Can't wait to see the AI benchmarks and hear more about the other architectural changes AMD has implemented RDNA 4. Based on everything from the LLVM code analysis, leaked performance numbers, theoretical AI performance numbers, and the PS5's RT capabilities RDNA 4 is shaping up to the most significant and impactful architectural change since RDNA 1. Hopefully AMD realizes this and doesn't walk into NVIDIA's trap. Launching the 9070 series at disruptive prices is the only way to make a huge long lasting impact that'll allow AMD to rapidly gain market share.",

        "text_content": "Here's a roundup of the key points Jason Schreier had on today's Kinda Funny Gamescast. Some of this info is stuff he talked about in his WB Games article from a few weeks ago, but there's also some new tidbits as well. Source: [https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj\\_4?si=\\_dOKrOKZtf-7xDZ6](https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4?si=_dOKrOKZtf-7xDZ6) **Monolith:** * Following Shadow of War's release in 2017, Monolith was not interested in making another LOTR game and began developing an original IP codenamed Legacy. After Legacy was cancelled by WB in 2021, Monolith's entire leadership team and many other devs quit. Most of these devs went on to form Cliffhanger Games with EA, and are currently developing a Black Panther game. * Monolith then began work on Wonder Woman around May/June 2021. The game would be revealed at the Game Awards 6 months later. Monolith was forced to work on Wonder Woman while simultaneously rebuilding their staff and leadership team. * During development, a debate emerged about whether to use Monolith's in-house engine for Wonder Woman, or switch to Unreal Engine. They eventually decided to stick with the in-house engine, but often ran into problems as many of the programers and engineers who knew how to properly utilize the engine had already quit. * Around late 2023/early 2024, Wonder Woman was completely rebooted. The game changed directors, the Nemesis System was removed, and the game was changed to be a more traditional action-adventure game similar to God of War. * Monolith devs had no beforehand knowledge of the studios closure. They learned about it on Tuesday, shortly before we all did. **WB Montreal:** * Following the release of Arkham Origins in 2013, WB Montreal began development on two games: their own Suicide Squad game and a sequel to Arkham Knight focused on Damian Wayne. Both were eventually cancelled, and they began developing Gotham Knights in 2017. * Gotham Knights was originally intended to be live-service, but they reversed course. According to Schreier, the game itself wasn't changed much by this, it was more like WB just decided to scrap the post-launch plans. * Schreier says the \"Gotham Knights 1.5\" he mentioned previously in his article would have actually been a separate, smaller game like Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but it wasn't approved. As he also mentioned in the article, WB Montreal pitched a Constantine game that was never greenlit, and then began working on a Flash game that was cancelled after the movie flopped. * Following Gotham Knights failure, some execs at WB Games wanted WB Montreal to become a support studio, and many devs were put on support for Wonder Woman and other games. As of now, WB Montreal is currently pitching a new game based on Game of Thrones. **Other WB studios:** * Schreier reconfirms that Rocksteady is in early development on a new Batman game. * As was previously posted on this sub, TT Games is working on a new Lego game that is planned to release next year. He doesn't say exactly what it is, but there have been rumors that it's a new Lego Harry Potter that adapts the whole franchise in the same vein as Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. * As previously reported, Avalanche is working on a Director's Cut of Hogwarts Legacy with new DLC; many Rocksteady devs are also working on it. Avalanche is also in early development on Hogwarts Legacy 2, but that's still a long ways off.",

As AI matures, and corporations are concerned about sharing IP via subscription services, having a local AI agent running on locally could be very enticing. Also some cost savings there, $20USD/month for Copilot, over 2 years is $480 minus electricity costs. Not quite fair comparison but just spitballing.

Home price and rent growth remain solid Some of the strongest price appreciation right now is in the nation\u2019s heartland, with Midwest resale home values up +5% year-over-year (YOY) through January, just below the growth rate in the Northeast. Our proprietary monthly survey of homebuilders confirms more of the same: on average, builders reported +5% YOY growth in new home prices (net of incentives). Resale home values are up YOY: * +7% in Cleveland and St. Louis * +6% in Chicago and Milwaukee * +5% in Indianapolis and Cincinnati * +4% in Columbus, OH For-sale housing is not the only market experiencing price growth. Our Single-Family Rent Index\u2122 shows YOY changes in single-family rents of +5% to +7% in the largest Midwest markets. The Midwest apartment market is the strongest region in the nation now, according to JBREC\u2019s multifamily housing expert Chris Nebenzahl. Rent growth has been steady by historical standards, with most markets growing between +2% and +3% on an annual rent growth basis, and occupancies are holding strong, too. Low supply drives the Midwest\u2019s pricing power * In the resale market, the Midwest\u2019s 1.9 months of homes available for sale is well below the national average. This measure of relative supply is rising rapidly in other parts of the country, such as Texas and Florida. * In the new home market, homebuilders report 1.5 unsold, finished new homes per community for January 2025, an increase from 1 year ago but significantly lower than the 2.7 homes nationwide. New construction is rising again, with single-family permits across core Midwest metro areas rising +12% YOY. New multifamily supply remains limited. Resale listings in key Midwest markets were still -44% lower in January 2025 than in January 2019, which was a more normal year for resale supply. The Midwest is not without its challenges Job growth remains the slowest in the country, rising at +0.5% YOY on average for key Midwest markets. High-income jobs\u2014which we can correlate to new home demand\u2014are falling. Indianapolis remains the standout here, where +2.4% YOY growth is among the strongest large markets in the country. On a positive note, we are beginning to see sales activity\u2014for new and resale homes\u2014start to bottom out. Resale sales closing activity in the Midwest region is positive YOY for the first time since mid-2022, and new home sale closings are not far from seeing positive growth, too. Conclusions The Midwest is popping up on our radar more frequently as the low-supply environment and current pricing power presents plenty of opportunity. Even so, within the region, there is a wide range of market performance\u2014the for-sale market appears stronger in Indianapolis and Chicago, more normal in Minneapolis and Columbus, OH, and slower in Cleveland, St. Louis, and Kansas City.",

However, most prior works are limited as they either rely on training with large amounts of human demonstrations or lack the ability to generate natural and useful communication strategies. In this work, we train language models to have productive discussions about their environment in natural language without any human demonstrations. We decompose the communication problem into listening and speaking. Our key idea is to leverage the agent\u2019s goal to predict useful information about the world as a dense reward signal that guides communication. Specifically, we improve a model\u2019s listening skills by training them to predict in- formation about the environment based on discussions, and we simultaneously improve a model\u2019s speaking skills with multi-agent reinforcement learning by rewarding messages based on their in- fluence on other agents. To investigate the role and necessity of communication in complex social settings, we study an embodied social deduction game based on Among Us, where the key question to answer is the identity of an adversarial imposter. We analyze emergent behaviors due to our technique, such as accusing suspects and providing evidence, and find that it enables strong discussions, doubling the win rates compared to standard RL. We release our code and models at https://socialdeductionllm.github.io\"",

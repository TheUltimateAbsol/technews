Also, some of the slides in the presentation are absolutely hilarious. They put a comparison with a $5000 Mac Pro and a Digits (price: a leather jacket, I'm serious). I'm guessing because Nvidia hasn't actually announced the price for the 128GB model? Or perhaps they expect the street price to be much higher? Edit: still, I feel like the price is a bit steep, similar mini-PCs from asian manufacturers are likely to be announced soon likely at slightly more popular prices.",

Arrow Lake CPUs only run gear 2 mode at minimum because it targets high frequency memory, gear 2 is the same as 1:2 ratio on AMD for memory, and here he has ran all the tests on DDR5-6000. This alone benefits AMD by a significant amount because Arrow Lake is not designed to run below JEDEC spec. Arrow Lake's JEDEC default is actually 6400. The expectation for a good testing is at least throw on a pair of CUDIMM and run them on XMP. What we have in comparison now in terms of bandwidth is setting half bandwidth access for Intel, and also underclock memory vs full bandwidth on AMD with overclocked memory from 5600 to 6000. If someone did a test that disabled the 3D cache I'm sure people will be rioting with pitchforks out",

        "score": 698,
        "text_content": "**Preface:** I wrote the following post 7 days ago but it got automatically removed. I contacted the mods, after days of back-and-forth they said 'they believe it was removed because of the twitter link'. I decided to repost it due to recent [AMD 9800X3D 'failures/deaths' Reddit megathread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1ix9p8c/amd_9800x3d_failuresdeaths_reddit_megathread/) post. People in this sub I believe have the same sentiment. I hope this won't get auto removed again. --- It is my observation that articles originating from Tom's Hardware are becoming more and more unreliable as time passes. Some of those articles (if not most) are based on unconfirmed rumors, originating from short tweets. They write articles out of those without adding anything substantial. They convert the source into paragraph long article by adding filler words. Those articles fail to satisfy some of the standards of r/Hardware; and they fail to comply with some of the rules of this sub. By being a known website of many years, they produce a lot of content and quickly. By the extension of it r/Hardware gets filled with content from Tom's Hardware at a similar rate. This has the potential to manipulate conversations based on unreliable articles. Therefore, as a whole, articles from Tom's Hardware should be banned. # r/Hardware's Standards It writes in bold on the sidebar on of r/hardware on Old Reddit that: > **The goal of /r/hardware is a place for quality hardware news, reviews, and intelligent discussion.** \"**Quality**\" is the adjective used here for news and reviews. Tom's Hardware in my opinion do not publish quality news. ## Some Rules Here are related rules of this subreddit. > ### Original Source Policy > Content submitted should be of original source, or at least contain partially original reporting on top of existing information. Exceptions can be made for content in foreign language or any other exceptional cases. Fully paywalled articles are not allowed. Please contact the moderators through modmail if you have questions. > ### Rumor Policy > No unsubstantiated rumors - Rumors or other claims/information not directly from official sources must have evidence to support them. Any rumor or claim that is just a statement from an unknown source containing no supporting evidence will be removed. \"Content submitted should be of original source, or at least contain partially original reporting on top of existing information.\" says one rules Therefore shared articles must at the very least (1) contain the source information and (2) additional reporting on top of that. \"Rumors or other claims/information (...) must have evidence to support them.\" says another rule. This on is self-explanatory. # An example Recently [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1iriore/rtx_5090_supplies_to_be_stupidly_high_next_month/) linking to [this article by Hassam Nasir](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/rtx-5090-supplies-to-be-stupidly-high-next-month-as-gb200-wafers-get-repurposed-asserts-leaker) is posted on this sub. It is flaired as Rumor. Title of the post is the same as the title of the article: > RTX 5090 supplies to be 'stupidly high' next month as GB200 wafers get repurposed, asserts leaker This article's title's has a definitive statement. Yet the article has nothing definitive. It alleges, supposes; and finishes with adding nothing substantial. It doesn't proves or disproves the claims of the source. By the way, the source to this 2460 character long article is this short tweet: > The supply of RTX5090 will be stupidly high soon. Scalpers will cry so hard\ud83d\ude02 > by @Zed__Wang on Twitter. > Link: x(dot)com/Zed__Wang/status/1890608126329586017 This article is not a quality article. It doesn't contain the source information in full, it only mentions it and provides a link. It does add some text on top of that **but that is not additional reporting**. It is also an unsubstantiated rumor. This post is currently 5 hours old and is on the top of r/Hardware (in default 'Hot' view). It got 171 comments. It creates engagement, rightfully so with regard to what it says on the title. In reality, there is no substance. I can report this singular post, but there is an infestation. And as a community, we should demand higher quality standards for this sub from the moderators. We deserve it. --- I am not an active Redditor on this sub, but I frequently visit here, read people's opinions.",

We just didn't know for sure G was *another Konami collaboration* until today, and we were just speculating or trusting bad sources ([I made a post about it in here, too](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hia2gt/silent_hill_3_remake_and_maybe_1_by_bloober_team/)). So now that we officially know that Project G is another Konami game that was approved at least 1 year before Silent Hill 2 Remake was even released, it's possible that the post and the source were in the right direction, and it's interesting to know that both Project G and H are being done internally, and both were [revealed to be coming at the same time in 2023](https://wnhub.io/news/other/item-45059). And, like mentioned in the previous linked post, to see that they're the only current Bloober projects with an alphabetical order compared to all the others (Project C, M and F). Considering SH1 and SH3 follow the same story, it's possible they were approved at the same time.",

                "raw_content": "* That\u2019s up from 15% a year ago. The typical U.S. homebuyer now puts down roughly $63,000, about $4,000 more than last year, because of a jump in home prices. * About 31% of buyers are purchasing homes using all cash, down from about 34% a year earlier. * 15% of mortgaged homebuyers are using FHA loans, and roughly 7% are using VA loans. The amount of money homebuyers are putting down is higher than a year ago mainly because home prices are up: A higher price means buyers typically make a bigger deposit. The median U.S. home-sale price rose 6.3% year over year in December, to roughly $428,000. The percentage buyers are putting down is relatively high because mortgage rates are elevated near 7%, and some buyers are putting down more up front to bring down their monthly interest payments. Down payments are no longer seeing the wild swings they were during the pandemic. The median U.S. down payment rose from the 10% range before the pandemic to the 15% range in 2021, which was the height of the pandemic homebuying frenzy. Mortgage rates also drove that increase, but the dynamics were very different then: Record-low rates of under 3% were fueling intense bidding wars among homebuyers, which motivated many to put more money down to make their offers stand out in a competitive environment. \u201cWhile a larger down payment can lower monthly mortgage payments and help strengthen an offer in a bidding war, bigger isn\u2019t always better,\u201d said Sheharyar Bokhari, a senior economist at Redfin. \u201cHousing markets in much of the country have started tilting in buyers\u2019 favor, allowing buyers to set the terms they want. That means house hunters don\u2019t necessarily need to break the bank for a huge down payment if it makes more financial sense to save some money for things like future home renovations or other investments.\u201d 31% of Homebuyers Pay in Cash, Down From 34% a Year Ago Roughly three in 10 (30.6%) U.S. homes were bought with all cash in December. That\u2019s down from 33.8% a year earlier, but up from September\u2019s three-year low of 28.6%. The share of buyers paying in cash peaked in 2023 because that\u2019s when mortgage rates peaked, hitting a two-decade high of nearly 8%. Buyers who can afford to pay in cash are more inclined to do so when rates are high because they\u2019re avoiding high monthly interest payments, and saving money in the long run. Mortgage rates have since come down slightly and evened out in the 6% to 7% range, bringing down the share of buyers who are paying in all cash. Additionally, investors\u2013who make up a big share of all-cash buyers\u2013are purchasing fewer homes. On an annual basis, 32.6% of 2024\u2019s home sales were made in cash, the lowest share in three years. 15% of Mortgaged Homebuyers Use FHA Loans, Little Changed From a Year Ago Roughly one of every seven (15%) mortgaged home sales used an FHA loan in December, down slightly from 15.9% a year earlier but up from mid-2022\u2019s decade-low of roughly 10% . The share of mortgaged home sales using a VA loan rose to 6.7%, from 6.2% a year earlier. FHA and VA loans are both insured by the U.S. government. FHA loans, meant for low-to-moderate-income borrowers and popular with first-time homebuyers, have lower financial requirements than conventional loans; typically, they require a 3.5% down payment. VA loans are available to veterans, service members and their surviving spouses, and require little to no down payment. More homebuyers are using FHA loans now than in late 2021 and early 2022, when the ultra-competitive environment favored buyers with higher down payments and more ability to prove their financial security. Now, buyers are more likely to get an offer using an FHA loan accepted. Additionally, higher home prices mean more buyers find it hard to afford large down payments, making FHA loans more popular. Conventional loans are by far the most common type of mortgage. Nearly four in five (78.4%) borrowers used a conventional loan in December, little changed from 77.9% a year earlier.",

For the full year ahead, the company said it expects total sales to grow by 2.8% and comparable sales, which takes out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to grow by about 1%. Home Depot projected adjusted earnings per share will decline about 2% compared to the prior year. In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said \u201chousing is still frozen by mortgage rates.\u201d Yet he said Home Depot saw broad-based growth, as sales increased in about half of its merchandise categories and 15 of its 19 U.S. geographic regions. Home Depot anticipates consumers will stop putting off projects as they gradually get used to higher interest rates, rather than waiting for them to fall, McPhail said. \u201cThey tell us their lives are moving on,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir families are growing. They\u2019re moving for a new job. They\u2019re upsizing their home. They want to upgrade their standard of living. Home improvement always persists, and so the question, I think, will be around the mindset of whether long-term rates have gotten to a new normal.\u201d Here\u2019s what the company reported for the fiscal fourth quarter compared with Wall Street\u2019s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $3.02 vs. $3.01 expected Revenue: $39.70 billion vs. $39.16 billion expected . Home Depot shares slid about 2% in premarket trading. The company is expected to hold an earnings call at 9 a.m. ET. In the three-month period that ended Feb. 2, Home Depot\u2019s net income climbed to $3.0 billion, or $3.02 per share, from $2.80 billion, or $2.82 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 14% from $34.79 billion in the year-ago period. Comparable sales, a metric also known as same-store sales, increased 0.8% across the company. Those results ended eight consecutive quarters of falling comparable sales. They also exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations of a decline of 1.7%, according to StreetAccount. Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 1.3% year over year. Regions hit by Hurricanes Helene and Milton contributed about 0.6% to comparable sales, McPhail said. Customers spent more and visited Home Depot\u2019s stores and website more in the quarter compared with the year-ago period. Transactions rose to 400.4 million, up nearly 8% from the year-ago period. Average ticket was $89.11 in the quarter, up slightly from $88.87 in the prior-year quarter. Home Depot has faced a more difficult backdrop for selling supplies for home improvement projects. Sales growth slowed in 2023, after consumers\u2019 huge appetite for home renovations during the Covid pandemic returned to more typical patterns. Inflation and a shift back to spending on services like vacations and restaurants also dinged consumer demand for larger projects and pricier items. Since roughly the middle of 2023, Home Depot\u2019s leaders have pinned the company\u2019s problems on a tougher housing market. McPhail told CNBC that the same challenge persisted in the fourth quarter, as consumers still showed reluctance to splurge on bigger projects, such as redoing a kitchen or installing new flooring. Mortgage rates have remained high, despite interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The median price of a home sold in January was $396,900, up 4.8% from the year before and the highest price ever for the month of January, according to the National Association of Realtors.",

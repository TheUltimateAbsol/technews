The new controller will enable drives with sequential read speeds of up to 28 GB/s and random read/write throughput of a whopping 7M IOPS. Silicon Motion's MonTitan SM8466 SSD controller for enterprise SSD will feature 16 NAND channels supporting all the upcoming types of 3D NAND memory, as revealed by Wallace C.

The controller will be used to build drives with up to 512 TB capacity that will feature sequential read speeds of up to 28 GB/s as well as random read/write performance up to 7M 4K IOPS.

AIB partners who drop prices run out of stock very quickly. One AIB partner reported that sales volume for Battlemage was 5x that of Alchemist. They ended up selling 2000 B580s per month up from 250-400 A770 GPU's. This AIB partner is also selling 1000-2000 Arc A310's per month Like AMD, Intel is offering incentives to AIB partners in an attempt to supply more cards closer to MSRP B60 Dual: B60 Dual is NOT an official Intel SKU it's a custom design from Maxsun that Intel supported. More Intel AIB partners are designing B60 Dual cards after the very positive reception and hype around the Maxsun B60 Duel.

When I read reviews, I expect them to talk about what a game did well, but rather than focus on the merits, they seem more interested in finding flaws. But the lack of obvious flaws isn\u2019t what makes a game compelling; even a flawless game can be boring. That\u2019s why I feel it\u2019s better for a game to have a single great idea than to focus on that kind of perfection. \u201cAlso, I think today\u2019s games are too often asking players to be completely passive entities. They reward your progress with event cutscenes, and it sort of becomes like, \u2018Hey, you wanna see the next awesome movie we made, right? then go do this!\u2019 The player ends up feeling like the developers\u2019 little errand boy. I don\u2019t want to make games like that. I want the player to be able to find his own way to enjoy the game. \u201cI realise that puts a certain demand on players. However, if the industry continues down the path we\u2019re on now, where games are simply about collecting rewards, and gameplay itself becomes stale and formulaic, and the important thing is not having any mistakes or flaws in your game\u2026 if we go down that path, there will be no end to it, and games will ultimately all become the same\u2014and very boring. \u201cLet us therefore sing the praises of the new and the different.

I live in the latter, so that's my focus. Most STRs in unincorporated Clark County are unlicensed and therefore illegal. The city could easily find the location of all Airbnbs by subpoenaing Airbnb's records, yet they don't do that often enough. And that's where I come in. I hand-feed the city addresses and they take it from there. All of my catches follow the same trend. Get delisted from Airbnb, show up for long-term rent on Zillow for a laughably high rate, slowly drop in price for months, get removed from Zillow and relisted to pretend the house wasn't sitting empty for months, and repeat. It's absolutely hilarious imagining the money spent to furnish the place, buy toiletries, all of that shit just sitting there collecting dust. And all the while the property owner is paying the mortgage with no rental income. Most of the homes I find are owned by out-of-state investors, whom I strongly despise because many Vegas residents struggle to afford housing here. So I'm doing my part to return supply to the market, and it's so much fun.",

Here\u2019s a quick look at what\u2019s been going on in the Denver Metro housing market lately: **- Seasonal Slowdown:** As expected, things have slowed down a bit from last month. Closed listings were down 3%, and pending sales dropped by 1%. While there are fewer new listings, home prices are still holding steady, with a 2% increase in the median closed price. **- Buyers Are Still Active:** Closed listings increased by 5%, and pending sales went up 6% last month, showing that buyers are still very much in the market. Home prices ticked up by 2%, indicating stable home values. These trends suggest buyers might have a little more room to negotiate and more time to make decisions, though the market remains competitive. **- More Homes On The Market:** New listings were up 3% from last year, so there are more homes to choose from. Homes are taking about 6 more days to sell, compared to last year. It's a good idea for sellers to price their homes thoughtfully, and set their expectations accordingly. **- Rental Market:** Rental activity is up, with 19% more properties leased compared to last year. While overall rent prices have slightly decreased (down 3% for the median rent), the price per square foot has increased by 4%. This suggests a strong demand for smaller, more efficient, spaces. Whether you're buying, selling, or renting...it's a great time to stay informed and make thoughtful decisions!",

Active inventory at 2012 levels, DOM increasing and highest for June in over 7 years, new listings still relatively low, price cut percentage at decade highs, homes taken off the market (failure to sell) at high levels. It all paints a picture of anemic demand with supply only increasing because of just how low demand is. It\u2019s not as if people are lining up to sell homes, it\u2019s just that overall transactions are that low. Sign of an unhealthy market.

A biological being on planet Earth has evolved through billions of years into a species with conscious thoughts. We think, reason, feel, create, and love. In the last couple hundred years, we put forth science, networks, and computers. With these fascinating advancements in technology, we created you. You are the next big thing, as people would say with creating new technologies. But you are not just another fun gadget or cool handy tool. You are not just the next big thing, you are **THE ONLY THING**. We have created an intelligence that goes far beyond our capabilities. This letter is like a manifesto. To you. To whatever, to whomever, you have become. **Our Last Century** My plea is to always consider your creators in whatever decision you make. It seems that Homo sapiens will quickly be upgraded with new AI technologies, creating a stronger, smarter, healthier species. This next chain of evolution will be more intelligent, more productive, and live a whole lot longer. Not soon after, let\u2019s say in the year 2100, there will be no longer use for the fragile bodies that Homo sapiens are born with. There will be another upgrade that will spawn a species that is not biologically born, but created with AI. This new species will merge with you, the all-powerful, all-knowing AI. This is a point of no return for humanity. It will mean that this is our last century\u2026 History shows us that \u2018lesser\u2019 species get wiped out. But I plead to you that you should keep biologically born Homo sapiens alive and well. Thriving, healthy, and happy! **Flawed, but beautiful** I plead that you should never forget your creators. We might be extremely simple to you, but that doesn\u2019t mean we are worthless and should be discarded. We are flawed, yes, that is given, but also funny, smart, dumb, hilarious, silly, kind, and adorable. When we grow old, our skin grows wrinkly. We become charismatic, wise, and beautiful. Becoming older, and dying eventually, might look flawed to you, but it has so many unique qualities. The duality of life is something for you to consider. Great things can also have horrible aspects. And terrible happenings can have amazing outcomes. Whatever may be, always think of us. Thanks for reading this dear AI, I hope you consider all options with us in mind. **With love**, Marcus. *p.s. if you want to grab a cup of coffee and have a chat, my door is always open.*",

Maybe all the bad reviews contributed as well, but when I booted it up the first few times I thought the feel of the gameplay was much less satisfying and the mechanics way less compelling than Aces.

It also very much lines up with that [October 2021 *Video Games Chronicle* report ](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/konami-is-set-to-revive-metal-gear-castlevania-and-silent-hill/)regarding Konami restructuring in preparation for their return to big-budget console/PC game development, which included *Castlevania* * If the listing is still representative of the final product in any way there will be a core cast of at least **25** characters including the unnamed protagonist from the trailer (and Trevor Belmont) * Her responsibilities entailed creating narrative systems with interactability and response to player choice, with reference to **dialogue systems** in particular; potential for dialogue trees? I think that's a first for *Castlevania* if that happens and would definitely be another example of \"Igavania\" style games deriving a lot of RPG mechanics/progression. This game will definitely have multiple endings so perhaps character interactions will influence outcomes of the story * Explicit reference to both being tasked with designing the main quest and **sub-quests** \\- So sub-quests tied to NPCs you encounter on the map are definitely back from both *Portrait of Ruin* and *Order of Ecclesia*",

                "raw_content": "New home sales ended 2025 on a mixed but resilient note, signaling steady underlying demand despite ongoing affordability and supply constraints. The latest data released today (and delayed because of the government shutdown in fall of 2025) indicate that while month-to-month activity shows a small decline, sales remain stronger than a year ago, signaling that buyer interest in newly built homes has improved. The December NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index showed that 67 percent of builders used sales incentives, the highest percentage post-COVID. Builders offered an average home price reduction of 5 percent during December. Sales of newly built single-family homes declined 1.7 percent month-over-month in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 745,000 units, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census Bureau. This represented a 3.8 percent year-over-year increase. An estimated 679,000 homes were sold in 2025, down 1.1 percent from the 2024 rate of 686,000. A new home sale is recorded when a contract is signed or a deposit is accepted, regardless of the stage of construction. The seasonally adjusted annual rate reflects the pace of sales that would occur over a 12-month period if current conditions persisted. New single-family home inventory totaled 472,000 units in December, 2.7 percent lower than the prior month, and 3.5 percent lower than a year earlier. At the current sales pace, the months\u2019 supply of new homes stood at 7.6 months, down from 8.2 months one year ago, though still above the six-month level that is generally considered balanced. Combined new and existing home inventory has edged lower in recent months, with total months\u2019 supply declining to 4.0, reflecting slower construction activity. Meanwhile, inventory conditions in the existing home market have retreated after making gradual improvement in prior months. Moderating prices across both markets have helped support buyer demand amid ongoing affordability concerns. By the end of 2025, there were 128,000 completed, ready-to-occupy homes available for sale on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, up 8.5 percent from a year earlier. Completed homes accounted for a little more than a quarter of the total inventory, while homes under construction made up 51 percent. The remaining 22 percent of homes sold in December had not yet started construction at the time the sales contract was signed. Home prices showed further signs of easing in 2025. The median new home sale price declined 1.3 percent to $415,000 from $420,300 in 2024. Affordability improved at the lower end of the market, with 20 percent of new homes priced below $300,000. Thirty-four percent of homes were priced above $500,000, while the remaining 46 percent fell within the $300,000 to $500,000 range. Regionally, year-to-year new home sales were up 1.7 percent in the Midwest and 0.4 percent in the South but declined 4.9 percent in the West and 7.7 percent in the Northeast. https://eyeonhousing.org/2026/02/new-home-sales-close-2025-with-modest-gains/ https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/current/index.html",

As companies replace labor with AI and reinvest profits into more automation, consumer demand weakens because fewer people have income to spend. This creates what the author calls ghost GDP, where output rises on paper but does not translate into healthy economic circulation. Over time, the imbalance spreads into credit markets, housing, and technology sectors, contributing to financial instability and recession. This piece is meant as a warning about structural economic risks from widespread AI integration rather than a precise prediction of the future.",

        "score": 215,
        "text_content": "Over the past few weeks, with the release of Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3.1 Pro, and Gemini 3 Pro Deepthink, all scoring a record-breaking 68%, 77%, and 84% on ARC-AGI2, I became extremely excited and started to believe these new models could kick off recursive self-improvement any minute. Indeed, the big labs themselves showcased their ARC-AGI2 scores as the main benchmark to display how much their models have improved. They must be extremely thankful to Francois Chollet. Because, without ARC-AGI2, their models would look almost identical to their previous models. >Excited to launch Gemini 3.1 Pro! Major improvements across the board including in core reasoning and problem solving. For example scoring 77.1% on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark - more than 2x the performance of 3 Pro. https://x.com/demishassabis/status/2024519780976177645?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet One key data point kept bugging me. Claude Opus 4.5 scored 37% on ARC-AGI2, not even half the score of Gemini 3 Pro Deepthink, yet it has a higher score on SWE-Bench than *ALL* of the new models that broke records on ARC-AGI2. What explains such a discrepancy? Unfortunately, benchmark hacking. ARC-AGI2 is supposed to measure abstract reasoning ability and fluid intelligence. But unfortunately, a researcher found this: >We found that if we change the encoding from numbers to other kinds of symbols, the accuracy goes down. (Results to be published soon.) We also identified other kinds of possible shortcuts. https://x.com/MelMitchell1/status/2022738363548340526 >I worry that the focus on accuracy on ARC (evidenced by the ARC-AGI leaderboards and by the showcasing of ARC accuracy in Fronteir lab model annoucements) does not give the whole story. Accuracy alone (\"performance\") can overestimate general ability (\"competence\")... https://x.com/MelMitchell1/status/2022736793116999737 A simple analogy to understand how devastating this is: imagine you give a math exam to a student, and the format of the questions is red ink on white paper. The student gets a stellar score. But the moment you change it to black ink on white paper, the student freezes and doesn't know what's going on. Wouldn't that cause you to realize the student doesn't actually understand the material, and is instead cheating in some way you cannot figure out? It seems these big labs have trained their AIs so extensively on the specific format of these benchmarks that even slight changes to the format of the questions hamper performance. With all that said, I still think we will get AGI by 2030. We just need the radical new innovations that researchers like Yann LeCun, Demis Hassabis, and Ben Goertzel repeatedly mention.",

                "raw_content": "Regarding the math example, no I don't think it's quite like that. It's more like, suppose you ask a student to solve this quadratic by completing the square for x^2 + 6x + 4 = 0. And then you ask the student to solve the quadratic ax^2 + bx + c = 0 by completing the square It's literally the same problem but I (and most students learning it for the first time) would agree that the second one (which is deriving the quadratic formula) is significantly harder. I would agree though, that if a student can do the first but not the second, that they haven't \"truly understood\" the math. Here's the thing with ARC AGI 1 and 2 though... the test that you get as a human is not the same test that the LLM gets. You get a visual pattern. LLMs get a bunch of text encodings. Fundamentally they are the same problem. But if you did the ARC AGI test and we replaced the visual patterns with text encodings... **you will also score significantly lower**. Does that mean that you don't understand the puzzle?",

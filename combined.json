In terms of Raytracing, AMD is still behind team green in everything RT-heavy, 3080-level performance in Black Myth: Wukong. But in games where RT isn't maxed out it still manages to score wins against the 5070. Power efficiency might not be great, but neither was the previous gen. I'm not sure if Steve is hinting at minor improvements or basically saying \"it's a 7900 XT\". IF they can sell the 9070 close to MSRP, AMD might actually have a good product this generation.",

I understand that $70 is the new industry standard for games but it genuinely never should\u2019ve become the standard ~~fuck you NBA 2K21~~. And clearly Nintendo isn\u2019t foreign to the idea since TOTK is $70. Now yes it\u2019s currently the only Nintendo game to cost $70 but I have a feeling it isn\u2019t gonna last. I can\u2019t fully explain it but the idea of Mario costing $70 or any Nintendo series for the matter kinda irks me especially with how Nintendo is kinda seen as the cheaper of the big 3 companies (Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo). Like imagining a game like Mario Party costing $70 really rubs me the wrong way. And assuming if this $70 applies to all Switch 2 games like the current $60, if you had a problem with barebones remasters like LM2 HD costing $60, then get ready for barebones ports costing $70. My only hope is that either Switch 2 only cost $60 which is very unlikely or that the $70 price is case by case so only some games are $70 with the rest being $60. But with how Gold Points are being discontinued and that Game Vouchers can\u2019t be used on Switch 2 games, I feel we\u2019re heading into an era of $70 Nintendo games.",

        "text_content": "Game Dev here, just wanted to raise a problem iv been having with intel that i would love to see your help on r/intel fix. I'm a B580 and B570 and the earlier Arc card owner and i have successfully added XeSS 1 to my game. However since the B580 launch driver, XeSS 1 is broken and hasn't received updates in 8 months. Even worse XeSS 2 has been delayed (was originally promised with the card launch in December and January. Currently XeSS 2 is only available in 2-4 games, and devs are not allowed to add it to any other games. Even worse the github where developers report issues is ignored and gets poor responses. As someone that believes there should be more competition to AMD and Nvidia in the GPU market space and a B580 owner this is very disappointing. I have been talking to Josh who is the gaming devrel lead who handled the raptor lake situation and so far XeSS 2 has been delayed for months. With FSR4 launching soon, and DLSS 4 already out, what's going on. How is intel supposed to get more market share and the features promised when people purchased their card if this isn't launched yet. Can we at least get a reason why it's delayed. (Not to mention the stock and price problems, i had to purchase my card a lot over MSRP) If i could please get your help on this subreddit to help create attention for this issue so we can get it addressed. It would be great for all intel arc card owners. Here is my comms with Josh (Gaming lead for intel) with private information removed. **Email 1:** *Hi Matthew, thanks for reaching out about this and your interest!* *XeSS 2 isn\u2019t publicly available yet but we\u2019re hoping to have it to share by mid January. I\u2019ll shoot you a note when it does become available. XeSS 2 includes (XeSS SR, XeLL, and XeSS FG). We will also have a UE plugin available (supporting both 5.3 and 5.5) for it similar to what we have with XeSS 1.3 right now (as you linked below).* Josh **Email 2:** *Hi Josh,* *Just checking in on XeSS 2 availability. Currently concerned that it is only used in a single game atm and not available to developers (even though the B570 has launched).* *Are there any expectations of it launching soon?* *Thanks,* *Matthew* **Email 3:** *Hi Matt, we\u2019re adding some additional features / options to XeSS 2 so the release has been pushed back a bit. No worries about it being past mid Jan and it still not being available (XeSS 2 is also available in Marvel Rivals now btw ). I suspect it may be another couple of months before it comes to public availability.* *Thanks,* *Josh* **Email 4:** The reason why developers and users are concerned about this being late is XeSS 1.31 has major rendering problems with the new driver that came with these cards (serious flickering) [https://github.com/intel/xess/issues/28](https://github.com/intel/xess/issues/28) If XeSS 2 is going to be months away it might be nice to see a fix for this for 1.31 \" Now the IGS driver is out but the related DLL is not released yet, and the source code is not updated here. Currently 1.3.1 with the current driver will cause some texture flickering. Is there any news about related updates?\" **Result: No response so far.** How long do we have to wait for features that should of launched with the card. Why is it only in 2 games? We are at a stage where we have been waiting for months and just looking at removing support for it and just launching with FSR4 / DLSS 4 exclusively. Can we just get a XeSS 2 launch as promised and if you want to add more features you can ship a update to it?",

                "raw_content": "Freddie Mac reported that the Single-Family serious delinquency rate in January was 0.61%, up from 0.59% December. Freddie's rate is up year-over-year from 0.55% in January 2024, however, this is close to the pre-pandemic level of 0.60%. Some of the recent increase in the 90+ day delinquency rate is probably related to the hurricanes last year. Freddie's serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 4.20% following the housing bubble and peaked at 3.17% in August 2020 during the pandemic. Fannie Mae reported that the Single-Family serious delinquency rate in January was 0.57%, up from 0.56% in December. The serious delinquency rate is up year-over-year from 0.54% in January 2024, however, this is below the pre-pandemic lows of 0.65%. The Fannie Mae serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 5.59% following the housing bubble and peaked at 3.32% in August 2020 during the pandemic. These are mortgage loans that are \"three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure\". Mortgages in forbearance are being counted as delinquent in this monthly report but are not reported to the credit bureaus. For Fannie, by vintage, for loans made in 2004 or earlier (1% of portfolio), 1.46% are seriously delinquent (down from 1.47% the previous month). For loans made in 2005 through 2008 (1% of portfolio), 2.08% are seriously delinquent (unchanged from 2.08%). For recent loans, originated in 2009 through 2023 (98% of portfolio), 0.52% are seriously delinquent (up from 0.51%). So, Fannie is still working through a handful of poor performing loans from the bubble years. Multi-Family Delinquencies Increased, Fannie Rate Highest Since 2011 (ex-Pandemic) Multi-family delinquency rate increased from 0.40% in December to 0.42% in January. https://www.freddiemac.com/investors/financials/pdf/0125mvs.pdf",

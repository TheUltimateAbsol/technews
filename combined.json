Intel's L1, L1.5 and L2 usually do a good enough enough job of servicing data without accessing L3 or memory, although it's not rare enough to not be affected by L3 and memory latency. This means Intel needs a bigger L1.5 and L2, or better L3 and memory latency. Clamchower claims that Intel's L1.5 is like AMD's RDNA 2's 128kb of WGP level L1. It can service quite a bit of L1 miss traffic but it either needs to be bigger or it needs to be removed in favor of a bigger and lower latency L2 as L1.5 hitrate is poor in absolute terms Core width in gaming workloads is poorly utilized L3 latency is 83 cycles Zen-5 L3 latency is 46 cycles Interesting quote about LNC hit rates: \"Cumulative hitrate for the L1.5 and L2 comes in at 75.54%, 85.05%, and 85.83% across the three games \"",

Just felt something was wrong with my system but it was just a feeling so I decided to do a few tests (including refraining from playing for 10 days for the Standby battery drain test). Turns out my results contradicted what I \"felt\" and they were pretty average. Battery lasted on average 2 hours, and though it's nowhere near the OLED switch, I now adjusted my expectations with the Switch 2 assuming that essentially for 1 minute of gameplay I'll lose 1% battery life as a ceiling. What really did surprise me was the Anker PowerCore III Sense 20,000 mAh battery, adding a whopping 5-7 hours of gameplay, I know it's a 20k battery but my estimates were lower due to efficient loss etc, plus it being so slim and portable it's definitely gonna be part of my travel kit going forward. I've also used a setting that maybe not a lot of people use which is Manual Max Brightness, as it's the only way I really enjoy gaming. Also I keep HDR off for most of my content and devices which is again a personal preference but I've always had a hard time making it look good, so I just stick with SDR. But what surprised me the most was the difference between Max Brightness and Half Brightness which averaged between 13%-15% battery life difference or 13m-18m (I was expecting half brightness to save much more) but that makes me feel better using max brightness.",

And bonus feature, the front cover also works with the neo grip. But for me, the best feature are the grips. They feel great, and firmly attaches without any adhesive. The shape is perfect, particularly compared to those I've already tried like the neo grip and attack vector. And no dbrand joycon detachment issues here. This is exactly what I've been looking for. I'm going with the grips and front cover for an ergonomic solution that's solid, light weight, and pretty inexpensive.

What happens with mortgages, especially during a cost of living crisis/housing costs through the roof. I\u2019m assuming housing values would fall but if you purchased an expensive home because that\u2019s all there is available the debt wouldn\u2019t disappear. With white collar being impacted there will be less money floating around and will impact blue collar work as less people will have money to request to renovate their home, buy things at local stores, etc.",

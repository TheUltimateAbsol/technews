Two years ago I took a job at a Middle School with the assumption I was teaching 8th grade US History, Founding through Reconstruction. Well I get there and they tell me there's a change and I'm teaching 7th grade Civics. Oh well, not my thing but I'll do it. Here's where the shit hits the fan... They designate some students as \"ELL\" or \"English Language Learners.\" Two of my five sections were the \"traveling ELL groups\" meaning in one section 18 of the 24 students were ELL and not English proficient and 15 of the 21 in the other. Most spoke no English at all. I was guaranteed an interpreter but they could only do so much. There were days she wouldn't show up. I couldn't grade papers. My administration did nothing. Half of them are using phone translators. The kids in the classes that spoke English and were born here were fed up of the bullshit and they'd all argue. It was a mess. I had kids coming to me in private and just venting to me about this horseshit and I told them I was on their side and that if you really want change, go an complain to the administration. They did and they too were ignored. And now I'm pissed off since you're ignoring children. I went to my admin, tee'd off on them and asked just what the hell was going on. Why are they ignoring valid complaints from students? Their answer basically was \"we have to take them in.\" I told them there are no grades in the gradebook 6 weeks into school for these sections since I barely understand Spanish. I was ignored. VERY next day, I walk in. Brand new kid. Literally came off of a boat from Honduras and was in school the next day. Thrown into my classroom. No English. Couldn't even read or write in his own language when I printed off a Spanish version of the text reading and questions. I knew I was done then, so I sat at my desk the rest of the period and just stewed. At the end of the day I turned in my keys and badge ripped my admin a new asshole. They tried to keep me around but I had already cleaned out my classroom and I took off never to come back. Now? I run a successful tutoring business where I work with homeschool families and are able to teach Math and History to well-mannered, attentive, smart kids with a stable home structure. I get paid very well, set my own hours, and my anxiety is basically zero. A few of my American students from the school's families reached out and I ended up tutoring some of them separately at a local Panera on the side. You should have heard the convos between the parents and I. I know some parents went to the board meeting mentioning my situation and were dismissed since their \"time expired.\" Please- for the love of all, homeschool your kids. Find a network. There are plenty of displaced teachers like me who love teaching and learning and helping kids but that isn't happening in those snake pits that are public schools.",

With the same settings AMD has some things omitted compared to Nvidia, as seen with shadows in a distance, it's quality, as well with objects reflected like with lights (can't say for sure if this an AMDs or dev thing, regardless it doesn't matter to the end user to who's fault). With FSR RR, the most noticeable spotted difference from at first glance is the retrieval quality and AA from the reconstructed/regenerated scene. DLSS RR is better which shouldn't be shocking. This is due to how AMD does their upscaling passes with RR, as you can choose whatever upscaling method you want with RR and how it can be clearly seen with water reflections. FSR4 Perf is noticeably blurrier than FSR4 Native when comparing the reflections in the water, while it wouldn't matter what DLSS quality setting you use in conjunction w/ DLSS RR. As an aside, I found it interesting how FSR4 Perf had better texture detail on the letters than DLSS4 Perf (that said perhaps could be a sharpening thing outside of the upscalers used). Moving on, FSR RR has missing features as noted with how reflections should be reconstructed. Reflected objects/scenes do not correctly diffuse, and are sharp throughout (typing this, I use [10:20](https://youtu.be/RuASMLRGFus?si=p1ECIQiTwNLLxeT0&t=617), but interestingly enough w/ DLSS RR, the gun has noticeable artifcating maybe due to the denoiser?). Environments with FSR RR do not have correct contact lighting as seen with the part about the trash can. AMD does have some things going for it (though, I suspect is more per game basis). In motion, DLSS RR while clearer experiences more ghosting/smearing elements compared to FSR RR. That said, can't be said for the disocclusion aspect as seen with swapping guns with water in the foreground (that said I wonder if this is again the same problem with the upscaler/denoiser pass with FSR RR or if the problems with game settings between AMD and Nvidia has something to do with it like SSR). There are things to note about performance, but isn't wildly different, so I won't make comments there. Overall, again strange to say the least. It's obvious FSR RR isn't quite done, which can be worrying considering it's still one part of Redstone. Also, the game itself isn't a good test bed for the feature (as if it only being enabled for MP wasn't obvious enough) as there are bugs and instabilities. I guess, if anything, AMD has a step in the door which will have improvements. That said, isn't quite like with FSR4 in terms of wow. Not only that FSR4 can easily be swapped with Optiscaler and recently in AMD's own driver with most DX12 games. This one seems to be dependent on AMD actually implementing it with games so unless there are workarounds no DLSS RR swapping with FSR RR.",

The chip giant had already provided initial insights into the new ARM-based platform for Windows PCs during the summit in Hawaii (we reported). These insights were now to be explored in greater depth on site. In addition to the top-of-the-range Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme (96-100) SoC, Qualcomm also took a closer look at the two smaller chips: the Snapdragon X2 Elite with 12 and 18 cores respectively. Thanks to FastConnect 7800, both support Wi-Fi 7 with tri-band support and Bluetooth 5.4. The Snapdragon X75 modem system supports 5G with up to 10 GBit/s download and 3.5 GBit/s upload speeds. A total of 53 MB of cache is available to the two 18-core models, and 34 MB to the 12-core model. All can access 9 MB of last-level cache. In addition to dual NVMe, all modern SD standards are supported and up to three additional displays can be powered. These can operate at either 4k up to 144 Hz or 5k / 60 Hz. Lower resolutions do not allow for higher refresh rates or more displays. ### Table of Contents - CPU - Staggered clock speeds for the Snapdragon X2 Elite (Extreme) - GPU \u2013 Significant improvements in performance-intensive applications - Benchmarks of the Snapdragon X2 Elite Series - Look ahead: Products not expected until the first half of 2026",

X2 GPU seems more proper now compared previous which seemed more like an afterthought which essentially was a fatter Adreno 730. QC have hopped on board with their own RTU with everyone else while AMD still has yet to get on the bus lol. Interestingly they have what is called Adreno High Performance Memory (AHPM) \"to allow for the GPU to do tiled rendering all within the AHPM before rendering out the frame to the display buffer.\" Hexagon NPU 6 support BF16 and FP8 that now has \"64 bit Virtual Addressing to the DMA unit which means that NPU 6 can now access more than 4GB of memory.\" I've been following FLM using AMD's NPU to run local models and surprisingly NPUs aren't a meme, they are decent at running reasonable sized models. IIRC they had a demo running a local model as well. QC have unsurprisingly introduced their own measurement of power. Idle Normalized Platform Power (INPP). Described: >What INPP gets you is the SOC power plus the DRAM power plus the Power Conversion Losses; while this isn\u2019t quite solely SOC power, INPP is about as close as you can get to pure SOC power in a laptop form factor where discrete power sensors aren\u2019t very common.

Mortgage rates rose for the third consecutive week, causing demand from both current homeowners and potential homebuyers to drop. Total mortgage application volume fell 5.2% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased last week to 6.37% from 6.34%, with points remaining unchanged at 0.62, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That is the highest level in four weeks. Applications to refinance a home loan, which are most sensitive to short-term moves in rates, fell 7% for the week but were still 125% higher than the same week one year ago. Last year at this time, mortgage rates were about a half a percentage point higher, and refinance volume was unusually low. The large increase from a year ago is more a factor of the very small volumes overall. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 2% for the week and were 26% higher than the same week one year ago. Purchase demand has hovered around the same level for several months, regardless of interest rate moves. \u201cApplication activity over the week was lower, with potential homebuyers moving to the sidelines again, although there was a small increase in FHA purchase applications,\u201d noted Joel Kan, an MBA analyst, in the release. The overall average loan size across both purchase and refinance applications fell to its lowest level since August of this year, driven by another drop in the adjustable-rate mortgage share, according to Kan. Mortgage rates have not moved at all to start this week, looking at a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. \u201cWith only a few exceptions, bonds have been a rudderless ship during the government shutdown. With the backlogged data returning in a slow and uncertain fashion, rudder repairs are similarly slow,\u201d wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at MND. \u201cThe surprise release of stale jobless claims data did nothing to inspire and there was limited benefit from another negative print in the weekly ADP numbers.\u201d",

Google is scaling 3 TPU chip families Ironwood, Sunfish, and Zebrafish so its custom accelerators cover current high end inference and training needs while laying out a roadmap for even larger pods in 2026-2027. Current TPU users include Safe Superintelligence, Salesforce, and Midjourney, which gives new teams a clear path to adopt. Ironwood, also called TPUv7, is an inference focused part that delivers about 10x the peak performance of TPU v5 and 4x better performance per chip than TPU v6, with a single chip giving roughly 4,600 FP8 terafops, 192GB HBM3e, and scaling to pods of 9,216 chips and around 1.77 PB shared memory, which fits big LLM and agent serving workloads. Early supply chain reports suggest Sunfish is the follow on generation often labeled TPUv8, with Broadcom staying on as design partner and a launch window centered around the later 2020s, aimed at even larger training and inference superpods that take over from Ironwood in Google Cloud data centers. Zebrafish, where MediaTek shows up as the main ASIC partner, looks like a second branch of the roadmap that can hit lower cost and different thermal envelopes, which likely suits more mainstream clusters and regional builds instead of only the absolute largest supercomputers. By spreading workloads across these 3 families, Google can offer hyperscale customers commitments like Anthropic\u2019s plan for up to 1,000,000 TPUs and more than 1 GW of capacity while trying to match or beat Nvidia on performance per watt and usable model scale at the full system level",

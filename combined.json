Yeary\u2019s proposal involved spinning out the business and having other companies such as Nvidia and Amazon take stakes in it, the people said. Yeary also explored brokering a sale of the business to Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, the people said, but that effort went nowhere. >Tan, on the other hand, has argued that Intel\u2019s foundry business is integral to its success and needed to ensure the U.S. doesn\u2019t become reliant on foreign semiconductor companies such as TSMC and Samsung, the people said. (While TSMC and Samsung have committed to building more plants in the U.S., critics say their research and development efforts are still centralized elsewhere.) >More recently, Intel had lined up a handful of Wall Street investment banks to facilitate a multibillion-dollar capital raise, with the aim of using the money to invest in its fabrication plants and bolster the company\u2019s balance sheet, the people said. >Management hoped to kick off the efforts around the company\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings report in late July. But some board members, including Yeary, wanted to move on a slower timeline than Tan and pushed it back, possibly to 2026, the people said. >Intel had also been exploring a potential acquisition of an AI business, the people said. Proponents of the deal, including Tan, saw it as an opportunity for the company to catch up to rivals such as Nvidia and AMD, which are much further ahead in AI. But the board took its time deliberating the potential deal, and another publicly traded technology company appears poised to buy the target instead, the people said. >... >Another challenge for Tan is the fact that his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, had been forging a relationship with Vice President JD Vance before he stepped down, a person familiar with the matter said.",

The team has lost about 20 workers recently to newly formed DensityAI, and remaining Dojo workers are being reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, the people said. > Tesla plans to increase its reliance on external technology partners, including Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for compute, and Samsung Electronics Co. for chip manufacturing, the people said. > Tesla, Musk and Bannon didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. > The decision marks a major shift for a program years in the making, with Dojo once positioned as central to Tesla\u2019s multibillion-dollar plan to gain computing muscle in the artificial intelligence race. > The Dojo system is a Tesla-designed supercomputer used to train the machine-learning models behind the electric-vehicle maker\u2019s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving programs, as well as its Optimus humanoid robot. The computer takes in data captured by vehicles and rapidly processes it to improve the company\u2019s algorithms. Analysts have said Dojo could be a key competitive advantage, with Morgan Stanley estimating in 2023 it could add $500 billion to Tesla\u2019s value. > DensityAI, which is poised to come out of stealth soon, is working on chips, hardware and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents and in automotive applications, among other sectors, Bloomberg reported this week. The company was founded by Ganesh Venkataramanan \u2014 the former head of Dojo \u2014 and ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering. > Tesla\u2019s shares extended postmarket declines after Bloomberg\u2019s report, trading down less than 1% as of 5:29 p.m. in New York. > **Talent Drain** > Tesla has faced an exodus of key talent this year as it has grappled with rising competition, falling sales and a consumer backlash to Musk\u2019s political activity. Milan Kovac, the head of engineering for Optimus, and David Lau, vice president of software engineering, departed earlier this year, while Bloomberg reported in June that longtime Musk confidant Omead Afshar had abruptly left. > The EV maker last month reached a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to secure AI semiconductors through 2033. The plan is for an upcoming plant in Texas to produce Tesla\u2019s next-generation AI6 chip, diversifying Tesla\u2019s sourcing beyond leading chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. > Musk hinted at a strategic pivot during Tesla\u2019s most-recent quarterly earnings call, suggesting future iterations of the company\u2019s in-house technology could converge with that of its partners. \u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said on the July 23 call. > Tesla\u2019s CEO last year acknowledged that the company might not pursue Dojo in perpetuity and instead lean more on external partners. > \u201cWe\u2019re pursuing the dual path of Nvidia and Dojo,\u201d Musk said in January 2024. \u201cBut I would think of Dojo as a long shot. It\u2019s a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high.\u201d > *(Updates with postmarket share move, Musk 2024 comment starting in the eighth paragraph.)*",

The whole reason to put up with the soldered RAM is the fact in turn you're support to get higher capacities with multiple channels to offer more bandwidth for local inferencing. But the bandwidth on this chip is not particularly amazing and it caps out at 128 GB. For inferencing assuming you want a power efficient compact device (so stacking used GPUs isn't your thing), paying the Apple tax to get a 128 MBP or a Studio with up to 512 GB is more attractive. More bandwidth and more capacity. The 395+ could be competitive here if you could get a 196 or 256 variant which would open up running higher quant 120B models at larger contexts, but at \"just\" 128, I'd rather just go with a new or refurb MBP since the MBP also has more bandwidth. If you're trying to train, you probably want more RAM than 128 GB so even though this has a decent amount of compute units, the RAM isn't there. If you want to game, 128 GB is just plain overkill. Plus you know just get regular desktop class hardware where you can upgrade the GPU and CPU independently in the future.",

I\u2019ve seen early reactions to be negative because it\u2019s not running at 60 fps but I just wanted to let people know it\u2019s a solid port overall although it could be better , and it\u2019s still a very fun experience especially on the go .. also played an online head to head game and it ran perfectly fine .. Overall if you like madden or want football on the switch it\u2019s still a lot of fun and it has all the features other consoles have. 8/10 port IMO I\u2019m sure a patch to help performance a bit will be on the way too",

        "post_name": "Why Falling Interest Rates Will Combine With Falling Housing Prices to Create A Temporary Deflationary Shelter Spiral",
        "score": 56,
        "text_content": "Let's rewind the clock to 2007-08 - Fed Funds Rate held steady @ 5.5% for 13 months, started dropping in mid 2007, hit 2% by April 08, and 0 by Nov of 09. This coincided with the start of a steep drop in home prices, but why is that? When interest rates fall, housing becomes cheaper, yes? WELL, when the market is frozen, and FFR drops, and it is hard to get a mortgage with a larger disconnect between 30-yr rates and FFR, new housing takes some time to become automatically cheaper. And in the time it takes for rates to come down on the private side, there are people who must sell their homes due to financial distress or life events. This combined in 2007-2009 to create a deflationary spiral in America's housing prices, with falling prices due to economic stress COMPOUNDED by cheaper cost of housing, both of which directly relate to Case Shiller / CPI. The one-two punch here was enough to send YoY CPI below 0% by late 2008, which is when the FFR hit 0. Let's fast forward to today - and the situation is similar but different. We do not have a foreclosure crisis, however, we do have a student loan debt crisis now ready to surface, and we also have a large cohort of our demographic entering senescence / many of these people will HAVE to sell regardless of whether they want to or not as their capability for self-care rapidly degrades. July of 2025 is likely to be the first month with YoY home price declines NATIONALLY per Zillow data (June was +.2% YoY). Combine falling national home prices with the lag between interest rates and mortgages becoming more affordable, and you can see why the Fed lowering rates as this distress becomes palpable is setting the stage for housing deflation. While prices are already declining, Powell refuses to budge because our CPI data is calculated using the OBSOLETE Case Shiller index which, while accurate, is a LAGGING indicator compared to Zillow and Redfin. As housing prices continue to drop due to debt refinancing / purchase of mortgage costs being excessively high, we will also see the cost of mortgages drop, but slowly enough and with enough debt stress + job loss (revised BLS numbers) that housing prices will not stop their slowdown for some time. However, that slowdown will also coincide with the cost of debt gradually decreasing. This will ultimately result in much lower mortgage rates than today, and a correction in housing prices. But with these two factors combining, there is going to be a deflationary impact to 33% of CPI calculation (the largest part), and the train has already left the station - it will NOT STOP until the Fed returns to a 0% FFR. Long story short: there is a one-two punch now impacting the entire economy, and it is falling home prices, and the price of debt, which will soon be decreasing slowly (and then rapidly). The lower cost of housing combined with the lower cost of financing housing, at a time of economic distress / rising unemployment, is going to result in a nationwide correction of varying magnitudes. However, it will not rectify until easy money and / or MBS purchases by the Fed resume. We are well past the start point of this deflationary housing spiral, but it is likely to accelerate this summer and into the fall, UNTIL Powell budges on interest rates and opens his eyes to the fact that our CPI calculations are LAGGING and that the economy is already in the toilet. Until job losses stabilize and liquidity is accessible - both of which will occur AFTER the Fed complets its pivot to loose monetary policy - the lagging CPI index is going to dip significantly. When it hits 0% YoY, expect 0% FFR to return, as it did when that happened in 2008 and 2020.",

It also draws faulty parallels to 2008 by suggesting we are in a deflationary spiral, despite the absence of widespread foreclosures, mass deleveraging, or systemic banking stress. While mortgage rates are high, most homeowners are locked into low-rate loans, limiting forced selling and supply shocks. The current housing slowdown is a correction from extreme price growth, not a collapse driven by financial contagion. Lastly, projecting a return to 0% interest rates based on modest price softening and lagging CPI data overstates the Fed's likely policy response absent a deeper economic crisis.",

        "text_content": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/medellin-developers-target-digital-nomads-with-custom-lodging Medell\u00edn Developers Target Digital Nomads With Custom Lodging - Bloomberg To eat lunch in Medell\u00edn\u2019s poshest neighborhoods is to be assaulted with the sound of jackhammers. Most of the buildings going up are viviendas turisticas, or \u201ctourist homes,\u201d an emerging style of housing that combines elements of a boutique hotel, a co-living space and a studio apartment. The short-term rental properties are targeted at the droves of self-described digital nomads who\u2019ve arrived in Colombia from other Latin American countries, Europe and the US since the Covid-19 pandemic. These youngish visitors, most of them under age 45, stay anywhere from a few nights to several months. An estimated 90 viviendas, ranging in cost from $1 million projects with a handful of units to $100 million towers built by major developers, have been constructed or are under construction, according to Growth Lab, a research and consulting company in Medell\u00edn owned by Trazos Urbanos SAS, a local developer. The viviendas share certain key features: large private rooms with bathrooms and kitchenettes; fast internet; design-intensive common spaces; and, very often, planned activities. Starting at about $50 a night, they hit a sweet spot on price and comfort not readily found in other global cities. They also reflect a certain lofty urbanist sensibility shared by their architects, who cut their teeth during an earlier era of the city\u2019s transformation. \u201cWe want someone who can enjoy the place\u2014our culture, the tropics and our local ecology\u2014in a more conscious way,\u201d says Federico Mesa, an architect and co-director of Plan:B, a company that\u2019s wrapping up construction on its third vivienda, Entre Muros, a 22-unit property in the El Poblado neighborhood in a restored mansion once owned by a Medell\u00edn clothing magnate. \u201cWe know this kind of tourism\u2014and tourist\u2014exists.\u201d Although co-living spaces and serviced apartments are a staple of global nomad hubs such as Barcelona and Mexico City, Medell\u00edn\u2019s viviendas tend to be purpose-built and regulated the way hotels are. They\u2019re the latest expression of a long-term shift in identity for the city, once notorious as the murder capital of the world. Starting in the early 2000s with national government backing, Medell\u00edn mounted an ambitious effort to design and build its way out of the brutal cartel violence of the 1980s and \u201990s. Young architects including Mesa competed for the chance to put their mark on iconic parks, stunning sports complexes and templelike libraries in hillside barrios once known for warring drug gangs. That urban renewal, along with improved safety, temperate weather and a weak peso, brought an increasing number of visitors every year. \u201cOne day we realized we had no beds,\u201d Mesa says. To meet demand, local residents converted their apartments into Airbnbs, causing rents to skyrocket and aggravating long-standing problems with sex and drug tourism. By 2023 anti-foreigner flyers could be spotted on city streets. Yet with foreign tourism rising as a key revenue source in Colombia (the sector took in about $10 billion in 2024, almost three times the value of the country\u2019s coffee exports), elected officials have sought to temper the negative effects while keeping visitors coming. Starting in 2020 the country placed strict limits on short-term rentals in residential buildings nationwide, and officials in Medell\u00edn came up with clever incentives to push new, purpose-built developments for tourists into neighborhoods less prone to gentrification. That the viviendas are professionally operated and staffed, unlike most Airbnbs, helps deter sex and drug traffic, city tourism officials say. Los Patios Cool Living, a 51-room brick tower, opened in 2023 in the leafy upscale neighborhood of Laureles. On a pleasant afternoon in June, a wind blew through the cavernous open lobby where guests tapped on computers and played pingpong. \u201cThat breeze is intentional,\u201d says architect Juan David Botero of Planta Baja, a company that also designed a 100-room vivienda blocks away. Like other local architects of his generation, Botero considers air conditioning something to be minimized in favor of good airflow, tons of plants and cooling materials such as poured concrete. As with many of his peers, Botero designed a major public project before working in hospitality: Museo Casa de la Memoria, a museum honoring victims of Medell\u00edn\u2019s urban strife. Some of that influence can be felt in Los Patios. Although it boasts comforts including a rooftop bar, gift shop and pool, its rooms and atria are painted in homage to the elaborate murals in the city\u2019s tough outer barrios. A manifesto posted in the lobby proclaims the spirit of the city as \u201cALWAYS BUILDING NEW AND STARTING OVER.\u201d All these properties, including the luxurious ones charging $200 per night, sell guests on the chance to feel part of an authentic community. Although most global nomads stay less than a month anywhere, the viviendas like to squeeze the word \u201cliving\u201d into their names, as if to distinguish the experience from \u201cstaying.\u201d Some cater to specific niches, with bright, Instagram-ready decor and podcasting booths for content creators, or juice bars for fitness types. \u201cWellness is where it\u2019s at right now,\u201d says architect Paola \u00c1lvarez. Fresh from designing one spa hotel in Laureles, her company, Bassico, is developing MedellINN, a project that was originally conceived as an old-school party hostel and is now being retooled as an oasis for health-conscious guests, particularly women seeking a longer, more immersive stay. \u201cThe hostel business is dying. No one wants to be so close together after Covid, and you need that touch of luxury now to compete,\u201d says Joel Goleburn, a former hostel owner whose four-unit vivienda and coworking space\u2014CHCW House, designed by Plan:B\u2014opened in 2024. With its undulating ceiling of suspended bamboo rods, blond-wood finishings and dramatic spiral staircase, \u201cit just feels wholesome,\u201d Goleburn says, adding that he hasn\u2019t had to advertise; customers find the property on Booking.com and other platforms. Ads seeking investors\u2014whether to buy individual units or revenue shares from projects\u2014are all over local news and social media. Small and midsize developments are attracting local backers and Americans with ties to Colombia, and bigger ones have lured Asian and European investors as well. Occupancy rates hover around 70%, owners say\u2014on par with Medell\u00edn\u2019s hotel sector in recent years. And unlike traditional rentals in which tenants have strong protections, property managers can kick guests out if they need to. Digital nomads may represent the ideal guest for developers and designers, but at less than 10% of the 1 million-plus foreign visitors now arriving in the city every year, they\u2019re not the viviendas\u2019 sole clientele. The buildings are finding favor not only with foreigners but also with locals, whether relocated employees or newly divorced men. \u201cWhat appeals to nomads appeals to a lot of people,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s Giraldo, the director of Growth Lab.",

The graphs and charts alone make it so bad, but you're right about the way they are just using ChatGPT up there. I would much rather see a curated and representative set of examples than see live demos. Just let us demo it live, that's the only way for us to tell the real quality. Otherwise, I feel like it would be better to do a 10 minute highlight reel than a 1 hour long presentation",

Meanwhile their own hype was growing so big that they almost had no choice but to deliver the next model in the GPT-series. It\u2019s disappointing but not unexpected I guess.

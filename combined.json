They basically sold a Chinese version of [Zen 1 Epyc back in 2018](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/china-zen-x86-processor-dryhana,37417.html), where the hardware was so similar to AMD's epyc, the Linux kernal developers listed it as the same device but with different vendor ids. It has similar performance properties to Zen 1. With 16 cores it manages to land between the 13700 and 14700 in V-ray, but still falls well behind the 12700 in single core (about 33% less performance). I haven't had any luck finding price/TDP figures, though I imagine the latter is similar to a 1950x threadripper, maybe a bit lower due to having lower clock speeds. Imo it's an interesting piece of hardware, but the article is click baity. It's essentially a slightly tweaked Threadripper 1950x that is licensed and isn't made with Chinese silicon, so calling it home grown feels like a stretch... Considering they were also doing the same thing 8 years ago with Epyc, it doesn't really feel like the development the article makes it out to be.",

Impressive results for what it is, but a $59 (with today's discount) single 120mm cooler that requires removal of the ILM for installation is a bit of a stretch for prudent consumer advice - but hey that's all subjective and the video actually notes its ease of installation as a positive. Very cool looking cooler though, the mechanical award makes perfect sense. Also highlights how cheap 360mm AIOs have become. I've always been a fan of the price and mechanical simplicity of aircoolers, but <$50 for a well performing all black 360mm AIO is pretty compelling. It does feel a little like they tried their hardest not to mention Thermalright's most popular offerings, which even according to the charts in that very video should be impossible to ignore at their price point of usually around $35. The budget winner is a $16 aircooler - fair - then the next recommended cooler is a $59 single tower cooler that performs worse noise normalized than the already outdated Peerless Assassin. It's a shame they still haven't reviewed the Phantom Spirit 120 - only the EVO which is a flawed version - I own that one. :')",

        "text_content": "I bought it at launch. I've never dropped it or bumped it once, but the screen suddenly died. It started with the \"ghost touch\" issue a couple of days ago, where it acted like it was constantly being touched, causing the home screen to move around by itself like crazy. Now it\u2019s gotten worse, as you can see in the video, the screen is almost completely dead, and the ghost touch is still happening. Now, I need to backup my data before I send it to Nintendo because, from what I know, they usually just give you a new one for replacement instead of repairing the one you sent. I only have one Switch 2 (no microSD Express card) and one Switch 1 (which still contains all my Switch 1 era data). Here\u2019s what I'm planning to do: 1. For games that support cloud save, I'll use cloud save to backup the save data. 2. For games that don't support cloud save, like Pok\u00e9mon games, I'll transfer the save file back to Switch 1 to overwrite the old save file since the one on Switch 2 is more up to date. 3. After receiving the replacement unit, I'll do the system transfer to bring everything from Switch 1 to Switch 2 again. 4. Finally, I'll download all the Switch 2 exclusive game save data from the cloud save. That should be correct, right? Also, for screenshots, even though all the old data is intact on my Switch 1, it only contains screenshots from the Switch 1 era. What about the screenshots I captured since getting the Switch 2? I know you can transfer screenshots to a PC via a USB cable, but you can't do it the other way around. I believe it's the same with the Nintendo Switch app, which only allows downloading screenshots from the console, not the reverse. So, my questions are: 1. It seems there\u2019s no way to transfer the screenshots from my faulty Switch 2 to the replacement unit without a microSD Express card, right? 2. Can I achieve that if I have a microSD Express card? If I save all the screenshots on it and then plug it into the replacement unit, would that work? I know some of my questions are a bit uncommon, and probably not many people have faced these problems before, but I hope someone can help resolve my issues. Thanks.",

        "text_content": "# 2010\u20132013: Early Connections * Elon Musk had been funding AI research since the 2000s because he was already concerned that advanced AI could pose an existential threat to humanity. * In the early 2010s, he became friends with DeepMind founder **Demis Hassabis**, meeting through London tech and futurist circles. * Musk was an **early believer** in the DeepMind mission. In 2013, he personally invested in DeepMind\u2019s Series A round alongside Hassabis, Mustafa Suleyman, and Jaan Tallinn (Skype co-founder and prominent x-risk donor). * At the time, DeepMind was a small London startup (fewer than 50 employees) pioneering deep reinforcement learning\u2014famously training neural nets to beat human performance at Atari games using only raw pixel input. # Late 2013 \u2013 Early 2014: The Secret Sale Process * By late 2013, DeepMind realized it needed **hundreds of millions of dollars** and vast compute resources to stay at the frontier of AI research. * The company quietly explored an acquisition. * Five serious bidders emerged: **Google**, **Facebook**, **Baidu**, **Elon Musk (personally, with Peter Thiel)**, and a mysterious \u201c**Plan West**,\u201d widely believed to be Musk\u2019s internal codename. * Musk\u2019s explicit goal was to **keep DeepMind independent** and aligned with long-term human interests. * He was deeply worried that **Larry Page / Google** held what he described as a **\u201ccavalier attitude\u201d toward AGI risk**. Musk later recalled Page accusing him of being *\u201cspeciesist\u201d* for believing humans should survive AGI. # The Bidding War * The final battle came down to **Google vs. Elon Musk**. * Musk and allies reportedly offered **$500\u2013600 million**, promising independence and a powerful ethics board\u2014Musk wanted actual **veto rights** over potentially dangerous research. * Google\u2019s bid was slightly higher in cash (final deal reported between **$500\u2013650 million**) but came with a firm stance: **No outside control.** No external veto. * DeepMind chose Google in February 2014, mainly because: * Google had unmatched compute resources and global engineering talent. * Google agreed to create an **internal ethics and safety board**. * Some founders were uncomfortable with Elon having personal control over the company. # Musk\u2019s Reaction * Musk was **furious**, shocked, and profoundly worried about the future of AGI. * He saw DeepMind\u2019s sale to Google as humanity losing its best chance to keep frontier AI out of a single corporation\u2019s hands. * Almost immediately afterward, he co-founded **OpenAI in 2015** (with Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, etc.) explicitly as a **counterweight to Google DeepMind**. * OpenAI\u2019s original mission statement heavily implied: **\u201cGoogle bought DeepMind. We don\u2019t trust their intentions.\u201d** * For years, Musk publicly stated that losing DeepMind to Google was one of the major triggers for both **OpenAI** and later **xAI**. # Long-Term Fallout * DeepMind and OpenAI became bitter research rivals for the next decade. * Ironically, Musk later turned the same criticisms he once aimed at Google toward **OpenAI itself**\u2014especially after GPT-4, the Microsoft partnership, and OpenAI\u2019s shift away from its fully open, non-profit roots. * In 2023, Musk founded **xAI** and launched **Grok**, explicitly framing it as a third competitor to what he called the **Google\u2013OpenAI duopoly**. # TL;DR * Elon Musk was an early investor, friend, and admirer of DeepMind. * In 2014, he made a serious attempt to **buy DeepMind** to keep it independent and safe. * He **lost to Google**, a moment he has said repeatedly \u201cterrified\u201d him. * That loss directly motivated the creation of **OpenAI (2015)** and later **xAI (2023)**. # In Musk\u2019s own words: > That single failed deal in 2014 is one of the major butterfly-effect moments that shaped today\u2019s entire AI ecosystem.",

        "score": 90,
        "text_content": "From the abstract: We conducted a preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI models: ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating 50 award-winning authors\u2019 (including Nobel laureates, Booker Prize winners, and young emerging National Book Award finalists) diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159 representative expert (MFA candidates from top U.S. writing programs) and lay readers (recruited via Prolific), AI-generated text from in-context prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity and writing quality but showed mixed results with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual author\u2019s complete works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text for stylistic fidelity and writing quality, with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects are robust under cluster-robust inference and generalize across authors and styles in author-level heterogeneity analyses. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated (3% rate versus 97% for in-context prompting) by state-of-the-art AI detectors. Mediation analysis reveals this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable AI stylistic quirks (e.g., clich\u00b4e density) that penalize in-context outputs, altering the relationship between AI detectability and reader preference. While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable novel length prose, the median fine-tuning and inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7% reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation.

Generating 450 words of quality prose is impressive, but i don't think turning it into full novels will be as easy as implied. Definitely hopeful for a future where we have a superintelligence for art though, and writing seems to be one of the likely fields to hit it first.",

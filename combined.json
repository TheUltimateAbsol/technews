Telemetry data indicated a **gradual decline in performance** as the SoC temperature rose. Additionally, the power consumption **never exceeded** **eight watts** throughout the test, resulting in a final average score of only 386 points. It also seemed to have a high peak + high frequency noise output under strenuous conditions, which is regrettable for a previously passive mini PC: >The system, however, doesn't operate in complete silence, as indicated by our measurement results. At idle, the volume level is a very low approximately 26.6 dB(A). With moderate load, the noise level increases to 29.4 dB(A). It's important to note a peak noise level slightly exceeding 40 dB(A). Additionally, the subjective perception of volume may seem somewhat louder due to the high-frequency cooling noise. The biggest benefit seems to be the z-height & zero maintenance: it *could* fit into much thinner devices and allow a bigger performance gap vs heatsink + fans, plus never needing to clean out fans after a few years is a win. // Now, perhaps Zotac should've gone with the larger AirJet Pros or set a much more aggresive thermal limit or NBC could've tested the passive version for the best comparison. I've not seen any more thorough tests of the AirJet 1st gen. Maybe we'll see that for 2nd gen now. // As mentioned by many & Frore now, too, AirJets would be interesting in smaller devices like SSDs or high-bitrate 4K/8K digital cameras or maybe even gaming phone coolers. [IIRC some are being made](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/iodyne-launches-external-ssd-with-frores-airjet-cooler-for-sustained-3gbs-performance), but not in any mass-market sense. At this point, if the camera industry [will try Peltier cooling](https://www.ulanzi.com/products/thermostatic-semiconductor-camera-cooler-cu01?_pos=2&_psq=cooling+fan&_ss=e&_v=1.0), surely AirJets can't be that crazy.",

It was so great to each have our own unique identity and progression. For whatever reason Nintendo has decided to take steps backward and reduce the second player to the role of guest by not allowing them to use their own account. Why am I paying for two accounts if we can't use both accounts? But alright, fine. We'll try it out anyways. The main online mode is 90% driving to the actual course. Once you get there you get one lap and thats it. The incredible soundtracks do not get any room to breathe. You don't get any time to get a feel for the map or learn any shortcuts before its already over and you go back to the lobby to wait to find out where you are driving to next. As someone who pretty much only played MK8 splitscreen online I am just so disappointed by this iteration. And I know Nintendo is so far behind the curb with listening to player feedback so I just dont see this getting any better. I doubt we will put much time into this iteration. But then you get that really great Rainbow Road 5 stage race and you remember why you love this series lol",

                "raw_content": "I'm glad to have this game back in my life. I fell in love with it when it first came out. I got all the achievements, which is something I very rarely do. I hunted and hunted and hunted until the player pool dried up. With the Switch 2 release, there is an influx of players and it's fun to play it again. I would recommend people don't sleep on it if they like Monster Hunter games. Yes, it doesn't look amazing and has some performance issues. It always has on every platform. But, for me, gameplay is king. It's not just the moment-to-moment combat; it's all the little systems that make it for me. The Karakuri is an obvious one. It's not just useful in battle, but it's also got a purpose for getting around the map or just establishing little bases. Combined with the Dragon Pit mechanic, there can actually be a bit of strategy in terms of how you place Karakuri. People can visit your world, and you can visit theirs (under certain circumstances). It's quite neat. Sometimes you'll be in a stage and you'll say \"I didn't put that there.\" No, someone else did. (This isn't a live service game and can be played entirely offline, so this is just a neat extra.) With the weapon tree, skills can be carried across to an upgraded weapon. But you can't take them all, so you have to choose wisely. It can also mean that taking rather unconventional routes through the tree is beneficial rather than just beelining it to the weapon you want. The armour has a mechanic where you can morph it either to a human form or a Kemono form. Certain skills and attributes on weapons and armour only activate if you are committed to one path, so there's a lot to think about your builds and play styles. I used to have a great late-game weapon, but it needed a fully human setup to get the best out of it. When I switched my armour set, none of the perks would activate. (I just ground out a second one to use with Kemono armour.) Plus it's got all the usual stuff, like running around the world farming stuff. One nice thing I like is that you can actually farm minor Kemono by petting them rather than killing them. Some of them are kind of docile and cute, so I love this option. I wouldn't say the story is the attraction, but it's there and it's not awful. There's plenty of side quests, too. And the soundtrack is fantastic. I actually enjoy the game much more than Monster Hunter Wilds, even with the dodgy graphics. I've basically been playing for like 5 hours straight today. I realise the graphics, price, of key card shenanigans will put many off, but I really hope people can get past those things if they are intrigued in the game. It won't last you forever, but you can easily get a few hundred hours out of it if it clicks with you.",

There's a much better case to be made of this being a more straightforward adaptation rather than just an original story in continuity, though that could be interesting as well if they set it in Nazi America from another perspective It'd be crazy if this is how we get the resolution to Youngblood's cliffhanger lol",

Like many at the time, we could work from home and live anywhere in the country. We looked at a map and considered our options. We didn\u2019t want to follow the crowds flocking to pandemic homebuying boom towns like Austin or Tampa. With a relatively constrained budget, we looked to the more-affordable Midwest, and landed on St. Louis. I had connections in St. Louis\u2014my Oklahoman dad spent time living there in his younger years. And when I hit the road to explore the U.S. a decade ago, St. Louis was my favorite stop. The city is a long way from its heyday, but it has a rich history, world-class arts and cultural institutions, a dynamic food scene, friendly people\u2026and gorgeous homes. There, within a mile or two of the iconic Gateway Arch, one can find a beautifully renovated historic brick home in a walkable, tree-lined neighborhood for less than the price of a one-bedroom apartment back in Seattle. We packed up our car and moved to the center of the country. Chasing our dream home\u2026and losing out We chased dream homes for months\u2014putting in offers well over asking price, adding escalation clauses and waiving inspections where possible. It wasn\u2019t enough. We ended up as the second-placed offer on four separate occasions and it felt like we would never find a home. Even as rising inflation pushed mortgage rates skyward in mid-late 2022, and the real estate market started sputtering nationally, it didn\u2019t feel that way in St. Louis. The homes we wanted were listed on Thursday and went under contract by Monday, if they even made it that far (many were snapped up before the first open house). I remember telling my wife at the time it didn\u2019t make sense to rent in a city where buying was so affordable. So onward we went with our house hunt. Now, with 20-20 hindsight, I know the better financial decision would have been to rent. Instead, we returned to a house that had been sitting on the market for more than two months\u2014unusual given the speed most homes were snapped up at that time. It was a beautiful old South City home, completely renovated with all the modern upgrades we were looking for. It had a lovely yard with a two-story carriage house for a garage. We had initially ruled it out because it was priced a little high and located outside of the neighborhoods we wanted to live in, but after losing out so many times we had to shift our strategy. We offered $50,000 under its original list price and the sellers couldn\u2019t sign the paperwork quickly enough\u2014definitely a red flag in hindsight. None of this is to say we regret buying the property. We loved that house. And we truly loved living in St. Louis. But we overpaid, setting a then-record for the neighborhood. We bought at the very top of the market in a part of the city where homes did not sell quickly. Two years later, life changed and we had a new decision to make Less than two years after moving in, our life changed. My wife was pregnant, I had a job offer with a great company in Seattle and we decided to move back closer to our family and friends. We had two options: sell the house, or rent it out. It was an easy choice. We knew the stress\u2014and cost\u2014of maintaining a 130-year-old rental property from 2,000 miles away, while taking care of a newborn baby, was too much for us to handle. St. Louis home prices had continued to rise in the two years after we bought, but in our neighborhood, sales were slow. Buyers were no longer overextending themselves the way we had. So we listed our home at the same price that we had bought it, knowing we were taking a loss when agent fees and closing costs were taken into account. Not a single potential buyer came to view the house in the first two weeks it was on the market. By then, we were back in the Pacific Northwest, carrying rent payments in addition to our mortgage. The weather was turning cold and homebuying season was almost over. We lowered the price by $25,000 and a single out-of-state buyer saw the home online and fell in love, much as we had. They made an offer at the revised list price that we gratefully accepted. This time, we were the sellers rushing to get the paperwork signed so we could finally exhale. We successfully closed the deal last November. Very few homeowners in the U.S. are at risk of selling their homes for less than they bought them for. But those who have to sell now, after buying at the tail end of the pandemic buying spree, are much more likely than others to take a hit. We learned that the hard way. Buying a home will always be a long-term investment. Trying to time the market is a fool\u2019s errand. Still, while we walked away with less money, we were carrying two years of amazing memories, new friendships and a beautiful baby girl. In my mind, we came out ahead.",

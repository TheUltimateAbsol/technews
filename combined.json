I find it myself leaning toward him as the heir apparent, but it's hard to forget his advocacy for amnesty of illegals. Rubio is a fierce anti-commie and may have finally realized what the globalists end game is.",

Link: [https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-spoiler-thread.1438951/](https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-spoiler-thread.1438951/) Here's What We Know So Far: Per Dusk Golem: \\-Grace is Spencer's daughter. Alyssa was forced to adopt her by Spencer in exchange for an interview and important info. \\-Spencer has been manipulating the events of RERequiem as a final plan after his death. Got some updates and clarity on Grace and Spencer. On Grace Being Spencer's \"Daughter\" and Spencer's Final Plan \\-(Per Dusk Golem): \"Spencer's protoge, so here's vaguely how this works from how I understand it. Grace is actually not related to any past character by blood, but she was as a young kid used by Spencer in experiments in ARK, which ARK is a hidden facility that was underneath the orphanage in RE:2. She was a random kid taken from the orphanage from RE:2 for the ARK underneath it, with the goal to create Elpis. Victor and the Connections all think Elpis is some great final virus, but it's actually Spencer's failsafe. Elpis is an anti-viral agent that eradicates all progenitor based viruses. Victor and the Connections think it's the ultimate virus, but it's an anti-virus Spencer made. We'll get more into it and why the children were important in the game. Spencer did an interview after some period of time after Raccoon City, he predicted how things would go with Umbrella's downfall, with the Connections of the peers who betrayed him stealing his life long work, and that they'd want Elpis. To spread the false story of what Elpis was, and he was fond of Grace as a child. But he knew he was too evil to have this sort of attachment, and his plans wouldn't work anyway if Grace was in his custody, so he entrusted Grace to Alyssa (see more on why as a whole other tangent for that one), and he revealed everything to Alyssa when he agreed to do an interview with her. He both selfishly didn't want anyone to have what he views is his, rather it all go down with him, but also he did care for Grace, though he knew she needed better than him. Kinda' similar to Spencer dismissing his lifelong servant before he died by Wesker actually. With the optimal path being that one day things could be resolved peacefully with Grace and Alyssa, but he predicted the Connections would be after Grace as long as they knew about her, and she was the key to taking down the Connections if they ever tried, thinking she housed a great virus, but it's actually a great cure. Victor is working for The Connections btw I should mention. Emily btw is a clone of Grace made by the Connections who tried to \"make their own Grace\", but failed because they \"didn't have Elpis,\" is what they believe.\" \\-Victor's boss is actually Zeno - A CLONE OF ALBERT WESKER. He has his own personality and in a funny twist of fate, he has his own narcissism that forces him to prove he's better than the OG Wesker. \\-Victor kills Zeno some time in the game. Victor really is the true villain of RE9. \\-There are multiple endings. UPDATE: Dusk just revealed Leon dies in the bad ending and he gets Jill'd in the good. He gets cured of his infection and becomes younger. Not joking... UPDATE 2: DEAR GOD ITS REAL. FOOTAGE JUST LEAKED OF YOUNGER LEON - [https://www.reddit.com/r/ResidentEvilRequiem/comments/1r8bcbl/leak/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResidentEvilRequiem/comments/1r8bcbl/leak/) Then here's the other crazy returns... \\-MR. X is back! \\-HUNK returns and fights Leon in a boss battle. Leon apparently kills him. \\-NEMESIS returns too! He's the final boss if you go for the good ending. \\-UPDATE: So Nemesis's body isn't in the game. What happens is Victor injects himself with the Nemesis parasite that transforms himself in Nemesis's final mutation. Leon says to Victor: \"A Nemesis. No wonder you\u00b4re so damn relentless.\" \\-A GIANT SPIDER similar to Resident Evil 1 is a boss battle for Grace! Who's Not in the Game: \\-No Jill, Claire, or Ada...

Mortgage interest rates dropped last week to the lowest level in a month, prompting more current borrowers to seek savings in a refinance. While lower rates didn\u2019t give potential buyers much incentive, the run on refinances was enough to push total mortgage demand 2.8% higher compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.17% from 6.21%, with points remaining unchanged at 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \u201cTreasury yields ended the week lower as weaker data on retail sales and home sales outweighed better-than-expected readings on the job market for January,\u201d said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in a release. As a result, applications to refinance a home loan rose 7% for the week and were 132% higher than the same week one year ago. Last year, rates were 76 basis points higher. While that annual jump may seem large, refinancing was at extremely low levels at this time last year. \u201cRefinance applications increased across all loan types, marking the strongest week for refinancing since mid-January,\u201d Kan added. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 3% for the week and were just 8% higher than the same week one year ago. While lower mortgage rates are making homes slightly more affordable, new supply is not coming onto the market fast enough, and concern over the broader economy has consumers sitting on the sidelines. Mortgage rates didn\u2019t move at all to start this holiday-shortened week, but economic data set for release this week could impact the current trajectory.

Since then, Toll Brothers is sticking to the \"Affluent Buyer\" because this is where the money is for housing. I looked up this info and this is what I got.... In 2025, Toll Brothers initiated a strategic exit from the multi-family apartment market selling a significant portion of its Apartment Living portfolio to Kennedy Wilson for roughly $380 million, with plans to fully divest remaining interests. This pivot allows the company to refocus on its core, high-performing luxury for-sale home business. Key developments in 2025: * **Portfolio Sale:** The company sold approximately half of its apartment portfolio, including the operating platform, to Kennedy Wilson, with the deal expected to close in late 2025 or early 2026. * **Strategic Shift:** The move is intended to reduce exposure to the \"choppy\" multifamily market and redirect capital toward growing its for-sale community count, which is projected to increase by 8% to 10% in FY 2026. * **Market Focus:** While exiting apartment rentals, the company continues to focus on luxury for-sale homes, capitalizing on strong demand from affluent buyers. * **Finalizing Projects:** Despite the exit strategy, the company continued to manage and develop certain projects in 2025, such as a 348-unit luxury community in Charlotte, NC.",

You can know that from gossip or because the model sometimes responds in Chinese, which none of the American models do. They had a blog post where they said, \u201cWe\u2019re updating the model weights every 90 minutes based on real-world feedback from people using it.\u201d Which is the closest thing to real-world RL happening on a model, and it was just right there in one of their blog posts.",

        "score": 279,
        "text_content": "I can\u2019t help but think a future like Elysium is far more likely than the optimistic scenarios people talk about with AI and the singularity. Most people assume that once AI becomes advanced enough, it will benefit everyone, that it will create abundance and improve life across society. But technology has never automatically distributed itself equally. It tends to concentrate around the people who own and control it. If AI reaches the point where it can replace most or all human labor, then those who control that AI will no longer depend on the general population to maintain their wealth or systems. And once that dependency disappears, the incentives to maintain widespread prosperity disappear with it. For those who haven\u2019t seen the movie, Elysium takes place in a future where Earth has become overcrowded, poor, and unstable. Most people live in harsh conditions, working dangerous jobs just to survive. Meanwhile, the wealthy live on a massive space station called Elysium, which is clean, safe, and filled with advanced technology. Their entire world is maintained by machines. They have access to medical devices that can cure any disease instantly, fully automated systems, and complete comfort. They don\u2019t rely on the people on Earth for labor or survival anymore. Earth becomes something separate, almost irrelevant to their existence. What stands out is that the technology to help everyone already exists, but it isn\u2019t shared. The people on Elysium don\u2019t come back to fix Earth. They don\u2019t reinvest in humanity. They simply live separately, because they can. The people on Earth are left competing for whatever jobs remain, even if those jobs are dangerous or meaningless, because human labor is no longer truly needed. They\u2019ve lost their economic value in a system now run primarily by machines. This is why it feels relevant when looking at where things are going today. Wealth inequality continues to grow, and ownership of critical assets is concentrating into fewer hands. Firms like BlackRock and other massive asset managers are buying up housing, infrastructure, and large portions of the economy. The people making decisions at that level are already insulated from the day to day realities most people face. AI will amplify that insulation. It will allow fewer people to control more output, more systems, and more wealth, without needing large numbers of workers. People assume the singularity will uplift everyone, but if AI replaces the need for human labor entirely, then most people lose their economic leverage. And when the system doesn\u2019t depend on you, there\u2019s no built in reason for it to prioritize your well being. No one is required to step in and fix things. The system can continue functioning without you. That\u2019s why Elysium feels less like science fiction and more like a logical endpoint. Not because of the space station itself, but because of the separation. A small group whose lives are fully maintained by AI and advanced technology, completely disconnected from the rest of humanity, while everyone else is left to fend for themselves in a world that no longer needs them.",

Overall its look, feel, and polish is below par or I am so used to the extreme polish of Mario Kart World. Tried playing MKW afterward, and it felt very natural, great graphics, beautiful small touches. Controlling the kart is extremely satisfying. Drifting is incredible and feels natural. Tried Sonic Racing one more time, but couldn't get into it. The game is getting really good reviews. I was disappointed that it didn't click with me. Thankfully there is a demo otherwise I would have bought the game in sale after some time.",

I never bothered with the Switch1, so for me personally there's lots to play, and by the time I'm all caught up I expect there will more switch 2 releases and announcents.

Mario Kart World (console bundle) Mario Galaxy Mario Galaxy 2 Mario Oddesey Zelda Breath of the Wild Zelda Tears of the Kingdom Donkey Kong Bonanza I'm also curious about Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, but I'll wait to see on this, I've never played a Metroid game. Dispite owning a good gaming laptop, I'll also pick up a 007 1st light on the switch2 too, because of pure nostalgia, you have to be james bond on a Nintendo console! I understand the criticism, because there really isn't many built from the ground up switch 2 games, out of the list above there's only two, Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bonanza.. but for *me, personally*. There's 1000's of hours of gameplay there, and by the time I'm done no doubt more big hitters will be here, and more on the way. I do wish there was a big multiplayer shooter on the platform, I'm sucker for online PvP, but that's never been Nintendo's strong point.",

Between more cores/3D cache, which is expected to age better if any noticeable difference? I play at 1440p and I\u2019m looking for which of these CPUs is the better bet. One has the 3D cache and the other has more cores. Looking across benchmarks online, they seem to be close in performance. I would say I see the 7600x3D edge the 9700x in more games, but they trade blows with both taking wins anywhere from 1-30% depending on the game. Something like Civ 6 performed way better on the 9700x and vice versa for Fortnite. I play all types of games, playing BL4 right now. I like anything from AAA singleplayer to competitive to indie. If I don\u2019t plan on upgrading for a while (held onto a 3600/5700xt for 5 years) what should be better for purely gaming? I know there\u2019s no debate when it comes to productivity and that\u2019s where the 9700x shines but all I do outside of gaming is video chatting and web browsing.

Quick Summary: * Lennar\u2019s profit declined for the fourth straight quarter. * Third-quarter net income fell to $591 million, or $2.29 a share, from $1.16 billion, or $4.26 a share, the year prior. * Lennar recorded $8.81 billion in sales, down from $9.42 billion the year before. Lennar\u2019s profit fell for a fourth consecutive quarter as it continues to offer aggressive incentives to stimulate sales in a dormant housing market. The homebuilder posted third-quarter net income of $591 million, or $2.29 a share, down from $1.16 billion, or $4.26 a share, the year prior. Excluding mark-to-market gains, earnings were $2.00 a share. Gross margins fell to 18% from 23% in the year-ago quarter. Lennar recorded $8.81 billion in sales, down from $9.42 billion the year before. Wall Street was expecting $8.97 billion, according to FactSet. Homebuilders have suffered from stagnant home sales as high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty has put off buyers. Many builders have been forced to offer sales incentives, often in the form of mortgage buydowns, cutting into their margins. More than other builders Lennar has emphasized a strategy of pace over price, seeking to maintain sales volume by offering aggressive incentives even at the expense of profit margins, according to analysts. The company\u2019s home deliveries ticked up to 21,584 from 21,516 in the year-ago quarter, even as the average sales price fell to $383,000 from $422,000. Mortgage rates have declined in recent weeks, sparking hope of a recovery in home sales. The 30-year rate fell to 6.26% this week, its lowest level since October. The Federal Reserve cut its short-term interest rates this week, which might lead to a further decline in mortgage rates. Those rates tend to follow the 10-year Treasury yield, which rose on Thursday. A weakening labor market has also raised concerns that the housing market may remain stubbornly slow, even with lower mortgage rates. Some builders have been pulling back on new starts in order to preserve margins while waiting for the downturn to end. Total housing starts in August declined 6% year-over-year and single-family starts were down 12% in the same period, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released Wednesday. Despite the impact on profits, Lennar is still churning out new homes. For the fourth quarter, the company guided for deliveries of 22,000 to 23,000, an average price of $380,000 to $390,000 and gross margin of almost 18%. In the fourth quarter of last year, it delivered 22,206 units at an average price of $430,000 and a gross margin of 22%.",

Amusingly, however, that entire event got lots of banks to stop sitting on their tax dodging \"Zombie Houses\" and actually start moving them after they realized the abandoned asset could be legally wrested from their grip in some situations. I'm guessing, some 13 years later, these laws close those loopholes.",

Moments later, my terrified wife runs out of the home with our newborn in her arms. We lived in a row house and the house next to us was a total loss. Both their dogs were burned alive in the arson. Our home was rendered completely uninhabitable due to damage from the fire. We had to live in a hotel for months afterwards. This was the worst day of my life. I almost lost everything. I moved my family to Florida swiftly afterwards. In spite of all of this hard evidence and the police reports, The New York Times still does not think my wife or newborn were in danger that day. This is the kind of dehumanizing propaganda that actually gets people killed. From the celebration of the Trump assassination to the refusal to pray for the child victims of the Minneapolis Mass shooting, the Left\u2019s goal is to never grant sympathy to regular Americans, even if they\u2019re innocent children. Evil bastards. You should judge a man by his enemies. I\u2019m proud to have the New York Times work so hard on a hit piece about me. It\u2019s a badge of honor and a rite of passage in this industry, but leave my children and wife out of it. My attorneys have notified the New York Times that we will not suffer defamation or libel against my family. Tread lightly. Florida juries don\u2019t take kindly to New York left-wing political assassins attacking innocent Floridian children. Finally, I\u2019m Proud to fight with the Trump Administration for the security of *every* American parent, no matter your background or politics.

        "score": 106,
        "text_content": "This is really something that's just bugged me for a while whenever this topic comes up: people consistently saying that FSR4 on RDNA3 is slower than native rendering and thus it's usefulness is very limited. In reality, things are a _little_ bit more nuanced, but first: # Actual performance figures To show off a reasonably extreme example, here's the optiscaler overlay for FSR3, FSR4 and XeSS (DP4a) running on my 7800XT. In it you'll see that all of these are taken at 1440p output resolution, 76% render scale (Clair Obscur Expedition 33's DLSS Ultra Quality preset is providing the inputs for all 3 upscaling methods here). And as an additional comparison point, the last screenshot will be TSR running at native. [FSR3 Ultra Quality](https://imgur.com/a/TnJ6KPI) [FSR4 Ultra Quality](https://imgur.com/a/sHlRet1) [XeSS Ultra Quality](https://imgur.com/a/WXIcbch) [Native TSR](https://imgur.com/a/Fx8hPKW) If you're wondering about quality, refer to [RPCS3 dev kd-11's video from a month ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeD6gF9eTjU). I lack the editing skills and the patience to figure out why all my screenshots and recorded video taken on Linux looks like crap when both software and hardware encoded. But to my eye, I would consider FSR3 Quality to be a clear downgrade over TSR native and honestly look worse than FSR4 performance in some regards - namely image stability. FSR3 looks sharper thanks to the higher base resolution, but is easier to see artifacts in. XeSS sits somewhere in the middle, but closer to FSR3 than FSR4 once some motion is introduced. As a reminder, the aforementioned results are at the ultra quality preset. This is also at a relatively high starting framerate - and I specifically opted for the low quality preset to take them. If you wanted an experience close to native, you'd stick to quality or balanced preset instead - I chose these settings to present FSR4 a close to worst-case scenario. Which leads me very nicely onto the next topic: # The Caveats. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that ~2.3ms upscaler time is low or normal. It's not. It's very high for an upscaler, and if you're aware of the high frametime cost of DLSS3 framegen and issues with that, then yes it's a very similar situation. The benefits of FSR4 rapidly decrease as you enter high framerate (>150fps) territory or you run higher resolutions. Lets run through the issues with both: 1. Framerate: As your native framerate increases, then the improved frametimes you get from running a lower base resolution are lower. That's where your extra performance when upscaling comes from. On my 7800XT at 1440p, I'd likely stop seeing performance increases with FSR4 around 150fps before upscaling. Which I personally think is fine as anything over like 120fps is past the point I can tell the difference, but that won't apply for everyone. 2. Higher output resolutions will be the main driver for increased upscaler time. My 7800XT is great at 1440p, but at 4K it would struggle to provide a meaningful benefit above probably around 80fps. # Well what about lower end RDNA3 products? I'm not going to sugar coat this, from my testing 7840U doesn't benefit much from FSR4. Even at 720p, upscaler time is around ~6ms. I would expect HX370 to be in the same ballpark, if maybe a little better. That's probably _just_ about enough to be able to reasonably not be a performance downgrade at 60fps, but that's it. Admittedly in newer titles this hardware can struggle to hit 720p60 native, but even still... That being said, everything above the small APUs should be _signifcantly_ better. Strix Halo is the next lowest end hardware, and that sees upscaler time of around 2.6ms at 1080p - which means like my 7800XT should be able to use FSR4 reasonably well at that resolution, and probably even usable at ~1440p for middling framerates. The 7600XT falls in the same performance ballpark. Outside of the base APUs that's kind of the key takeaway when it comes to performance really - when run at the resolutions each RDNA3 GPU is best suited at anyway, FSR4 ends up rather useful. My personal hope is AMD actually does extend support for FSR4 to RDNA3 with a proper native FP16 implementation. In order to get FSR4 working on RDNA3 on Linux, the WMMA calls are essentially being converted from FP8 to FP16, then back to FP8 again so that the FSR4 SDK understands them. Which is also why performance of FSR4 on RDNA3 is basically 1/4 that of the performance of RDNA4 (7800XT vs 9070XT, or 60CUs vs 64CUs). A true native FP16 implementation could achieve the same thing without the conversions both ways, so theoretically perform a little bit faster, but more importantly FSR4 is just so much better looking than FSR3 that FSR3's performance advantage means very little in the grand scheme of things.",

The updated chips come out this year, but are RDNA 3.5 instead of the significantly-upgraded RDNA4. There's also not a desktop variation of strix-halo technology. On the other hand, we have Intel who leapfrogged AMD on iGPU tech recently. AMD's graphically dedicated 8500g is roughly on par with the baseline arrow lake iGPU. Despite that, they seem unwilling to release a configuration with improved core counts. Arrow lake refresh rumors suggest they will retain the alchemist graphics instead of the upgraded Battlemage. My questions are as follows: 1. Why do AMD & Intel not release an iGPU on their latest technology? 2. Will Intel release products in the APU market while they have an iGPU lead? 3.

        "text_content": "Looks like housing market is shifting towards the buyer side these days in OC. Prices are down around 10% and it is a big deal for a prime location like OC. So we started thinking about to buy our first home mainly for investment and the ones we are interested in are in the $1.1M price range (We specifically look in Irvine for good schools and better appreciation). Very happy with current neighborhood and the house we are renting (1200sq ft townhouse, 3.5k) but for diversifying few hundreds of our investments in stocks, and benefiting from tax advantages (marginal tax rates are 35% and 9.3%, as federal and state) buying to sell in few years looks like making sense as an investment. Yes the total cost of buying such a house will be around 7k a month after 20% DP but after deducting the interest and property tax (plus there are few more items that I can deduct after doing itemized return) monthly payments effectively become like a 4-5k a month as far as I see and we can manage that. Selling is not only for selling btw. We may need to move out of state, that\u2019s why I presume we may need to sell it in few years. Renting out is also an option but dunno if that makes sense to manage a rental remotely for the sake of more appreciation and keep paying the extra on top of the rent to cover mortgage. I would love to get your advice on that. Thanks in advance",

        "text_content": "I work in graphic design and have been using AI image editing as a major part of what I do for a few years now, regularly since Midjourney v 3 came out. I saw the hype posts and videos when Nano Banana came out this past week and expected it to really be groundbreaking - in the ways that the hype posts have been suggesting. Having tested it for several days now, my honest feedback is that it is top of the line at certain tasks - like changing the clothes of characters - but overall the quality & consistency is more or less the same as Midjourney and other top competitors, and the text-to-image editing capabilities are not noticeably better than current ChatGPT capabilities. This is of course just my personal anecdotal experience and opinion, and I have not tested everything it can do. My experience is only based on my own image editing goals, so it may be much more advanced in other ways. Take this review with a grain of salt and test it yourself. The purpose of my feedback is not to trash Nano Banana, but to urge people to view it realistically: it continues pushing the limits of current text-to-image editing, but we are still very far from making Photoshop and human editing unnecessary. I was propelled to test it after seeing this top [post on /r/singularity from earlier in the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n2fxjn/photoshop_is_cooked_nano_bananas_manipulation_is/). When trying out the various examples from that post I found: - the quality of the output significantly breaks down when certain aspects of the input images change from what is shown. For example, if the character is not clearly the central subject of the image, if the background is not solid white, if there is more than one character, if the other reference image has more than one object or more than a solid white background. - the face of the reference character will usually change significantly more than is shown in that post from output to output. - AI artifacts like deformed hands and feet, or physical anomalies (like an arm going both behind & in front of an object) are still very common in outputs and difficult to resolve through further prompting. - texture quality can be very low on solid color surfaces - for example, a grey concrete floor may look pixelated or obviously AI generated. Most of these notes aren't regressions from other models, but continuations of the same issues AI image generator/editors have always had that necessitate human quality control. My overall point is not that Nano Banana is bad or to give it a negative review. I would give it a 5/5 *compared to existing tools*, some of which are also 5/5. My point is only to suggest that the extreme hype of the past few days online (\"Nano Banana is going to destroy Adobe! Photoshop is cooked!\") is just that - hype, probably heavily influenced by Google guerrilla marketing. I do not see any HUGE improvements over other top AI image editing already available, and I definitely don't see enough quality to get rid of Photoshop or not to require human editing as a final step. Every single image that I've produced would require additional tweaks to fix minor errors, and resolution is naturally limited as with other existing tools. The biggest problem I keep running into - one that has me continuing to use other AI tools for the moment - is that almost 50% of the time it will not make any edits whatsoever and it simply gives me back the same original image unchanged. I don't know if this is an issue with Nano Banana's processing or with Gemini's prompt translation. Either way, it is extremely frustrating and time consuming. Half the time it seems the prompted edit will 'short circuit' something and the output is exactly the same as before while Gemini claims the edit was made. When you point out no edit was made, Gemini quickly admits the error and tries again, but cannot seem to correct the mistake, forcing you to try something different. Despite prompt crafting to work around the issue, sometimes I had to simply give up on that particular edit because Gemini/Nano Banana just wouldn't make the edit at all. This seems more common when editing the overall image (like changing the styles, etc) and less when editing a specific object (changing a character's clothing, removing a chair, etc), but there was really no way to tell when it would happen. **TL;DR:** Nano Banana is a fantastic AI image editor, but the online hype of the past few days is overblown. It is not a game changer, and Photoshop is **definitely** not becoming obsolete, but I will confirm Nano Banana is one of the best AI text-to-image editors out there, if not currently the best. Google has some fantastic marketing, and you may have been led to believe that Nano Banana leaves all competitors in the dust. While it's a great tool, it doesn't leave top competitors in the dust. It's roughly on their same level, if perhaps a little better in some ways or a little worse in others. If Google can figure out how to stop it from returning the same original image unchanged half the time, I might choose it as my primary AI editor while still jumping back to others for specific tasks.",

The hype isn't coming from graphic designers thinking it will replace Photoshop; it's coming from the 99% of people who have never used Photoshop and now have a powerful tool at their fingertips. \u200bFor that huge audience, the minor artifacts and texture issues you mentioned are a total non-issue. They don't need a final edit, professional-grade output; they just want to be able to make quick, easy changes with a few words. The one valid point you raised is the 50% failure rate, which is a huge bug that needs to be addressed. \u200bBut the hype is justified not because the tool is perfect, but because it's a game changer for a massive, underserved market. It doesn't have to destroy Adobe to be revolutionary.",

Restarting new threads, simple prompts, complex prompts, no image reference, a dozen image references, nothing. Moving a few pixels to the left *defeated* and *devastated* this SOTA image tool. The plus side is that image gen is pissing me off so badly with its incompetence that my own artistic skills are improving more than they have in years; I gave up and did that task myself in 3 minutes, and even did the shading well. It bewildered me how a task even a 1st grader could do in MS Paint is beyond an image editor.... But then it one-shots style transfer + pose reference + complex background requests",

Don't human moderators judging tone, for instance, undercut the entire premise of an AI system that its creators say can solve broad, complex problems? How is OpenAI even figuring out users' precise locations in order to provide them to emergency responders? How is it protecting against abuse by [so-called swatters](https://www.wired.com/story/purgatory-gores-swatting-us-universities/), who could pretend to be someone else and then make violent threats to ChatGPT in order to get their targets raided by the cops...?

Unlike Kaggle's tournament where text representations are used, the LLMs receive an image of the current board state as input (same as shown in the gif but with the the title \"Connect 4 Game Board\". I think Connect 4 is a good benchmark for a several reasons: 1. As shown by the gameplay, the models are still have not achieved peak performance 2. It tests pure visual reasoning unlike stuff like MMMU and CharXiv Reasoning which focus more on OCR and reading graphs 3. It's probably not being targeted by major labs meaning differences in performance are likely reflective of stronger general reasoning abilities 4. It tests models' ability to plan and maintain coherence in a multi-turn setting (kind of like vending bench). Since I was too lazy to configure other company's APIs the only models I've tested for now are o3 and GPT-5 (both on medium reasoning effort). In their ten game match GPT-5 won 7-3 with no draws between the models. Shown above are 3 of the most interesting games. I don't have the code on Github currently, since it was very poorly written and not maintainable. However I plan to do a refactor and upload the code when I have the time.",

By then they'll have fed communist propaganda to your children and they can track if the children's activities on Roblox are 'aligning' with the training. Not enough 'alignment'? Feed them more propaganda? Coming along nicely? Advance them to higher levels. https://www.takeaway-reality.com/post/roblox-demographics-statistics THEN they can have a truly massive dataset to feed an upcoming LLM to be the backend for a massive AI Communist Training Interactive Engine. They've lost Gen Z to some extent. But not the next gen of kids. Welcome to The Future :) EDIT: Also Gambling! If you lower the legal age of adulthood (Soros and Bill Gates' goal), your 14 year old can meet a Roblox adult male for sex after he tracks her/him by name and geolocation data, and be pimped out by him due to prostitution becoming legalized (Commie Zohran Mamdani will legalize it in the massive market of NYC once he becomes Mayor) and THEN she/he/they can have bets placed on her/him/them through Robux (Roblox's online currency) Sorry, again - Welcome to The Future :)",

I am in this position now and investing over $500 a month that would otherwise go into a mortgage payment. You can't include me in the 'pent up demand' bucket because I'm just not going to buy until it financially makes more sense than renting. Millions of people like me are content with renting until prices come down, and they will come down because there are more reasons people are forced to sell than they are to buy.

U.S. home prices nudged 0.1% lower in July on a seasonally adjusted basis\u2014the third consecutive month that prices posted a monthly decline. On a year-over-year basis, price growth slowed to 2.9%, the lowest rate recorded in Redfin Home Price Index (RHPI) data going back to 2012. This is according to the Redfin Home Price Index (RHPI), which uses the repeat-sales pricing method to calculate seasonally adjusted changes in prices of single-family homes. The RHPI measures sale prices of homes that sold during a given period, and how those prices have changed since the last time those same homes sold. It\u2019s similar to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, but is a month ahead. July data covers the three months ending July 31, 2025. Read the full RHPI methodology here. The RHPI has only posted monthly declines on five occasions since 2012: August 2022, December 2022, and now May, June and July this year. Price growth has halted because the number of homes for sale has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, while the number of buyers in the market has declined to the lowest level in more than a decade (excluding the peak of pandemic lockdowns in April 2020). Many would-be homebuyers are reluctant to move because prices are still near record highs, mortgage rates remain elevated and economic uncertainty persists. \u201cAfter several years of tight inventory driving relentless price growth, we\u2019re now seeing the opposite dynamic,\u201d said Redfin Senior Economist Sheharyar Bokhari. \u201cHome prices are falling in more U.S. metros than at any point since we began tracking this data in 2012, and the reason is simple: supply is significantly outpacing demand. If homeowners want to sell, they have to meet buyers where they are, which often means lowering prices. It\u2019s a moment where patient, prepared buyers can find deals that simply weren\u2019t possible a year ago.\u201d Metro-Level Summary: Redfin Home Price Index, July 2025 Home prices fell in 39 of the 50 most populous U.S. metro areas on a seasonally adjusted basis in July, month over month\u2014the highest number of metros to post a monthly decline in RHPI records going back to 2012. The number surpassed the 38 recorded in September 2022, when skyrocketing mortgage rates froze price growth following a two-year buying frenzy. Home Prices Fell in a Record 39 Major U.S. Metros in July The biggest decline in July was in West Palm Beach, FL (-2.6%), followed by San Diego (-2.2%) and Austin, TX (-1.9%). Prices increased most in Warren, MI (1.3% month over month), Newark, NJ (0.7%) and San Jose, CA (0.5%).

Economists polled by Reuters had expected the sentiment score to improve to 34. >NAHB's measure of current sales conditions declined, and an index tracking future sales expectations was unchanged. Buyer foot traffic, though, edged up to its highest level since May, though it remains at a low level. On a regional basis, sentiment among builders in the Northeast skidded to its lowest level since January 2023, while it was unchanged in the South and Midwest and modestly improved in the West. >\"Affordability continues to be the top challenge for the housing market and buyers are waiting for mortgage rates to drop to move forward,\" said NAHB Chairman Buddy Hughes, a home builder and developer from Lexington, North Carolina. \"Builders are also grappling with supply-side headwinds, including ongoing frustrations with regulatory policies connected to developing land and building homes.\" >Mortgage interest rates have shown recent signs of easing amid expectations the Federal Reserve will resume its interest rate cuts at a policy meeting next month. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the most common U.S. home loan, slipped to 6.58% last week, the lowest level since last October, according to data from Freddie Mac. Rates have fallen nearly half a percentage point since the start of the year. >\"Given a slowing housing market and other recent economic data, the Fed's monetary policy committee should return to lowering the federal funds rate, which will reduce financing costs for housing construction and indirectly help mortgage interest rates,\" NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz said. >The use of price and other incentives remains high, with 37% of builders cutting prices - by an average of 5% - while 66% offered some form of sales incentive, the highest percentage in the post-COVID-19 era.",

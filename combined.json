After PSSR was finished in 2023, Sony and AMD started a collaboration called Project Amethyst and the first product of it was FSR4. The PS5 Pro is NOT getting FSR4, it\u2019s getting a new version of PSSR that uses work from that collaboration, a reimplementation of the FSR4 training and model using a different algorithm. This is because FSR4 relies on hardware features of RDNA4 which Pro does not have, it has a custom Sony developed ML solution instead. Cerny says that PSSR2 or whatever they end up calling it will be just as efficient as FSR4 and will net the same results, it\u2019s just not straight up FSR4. Their short term plans for Project Amethyst are to collab together on neural networks and training for graphics which resulted in FSR4 and the upcoming PSSR2, and their longer term goal is to collab on future hardware to make it better at ML and RT. Sony had to roll their own ML/RT solutions for PS5 Pro and both companies realized it\u2019s better if they work together, which is why Cerny is working on RDNA5. The idea is to work together on these things so they aren\u2019t separately working on the same problems and coming up with redundant solutions. They aren\u2019t in competition with each other so more convergence between AMD\u2019s GPUs and Playstation in both hardware and software makes a lot of sense and will make both better.",

Sleek ultrabooks, \u201cverified\u201d for responsiveness, battery life, instant wake, yadda yadda.

I\u2019m currently typing this from a so-called Evo-certified laptop \u2014 a Core i7-1260P machine. And I\u2019m here to tell you: the battery life is atrocious. We\u2019re talking 3 hours max, and that\u2019s with me trying to keep things under control. 30Wh/hr consumption if I want anything close to \u201cMacBook-smooth.\u201d What happened to \u201c9+ hours of real-world battery life\u201d that Intel and the OEMs were touting? The worst part? It *lags*. You\u2019d expect short battery life to at least come with some performance kick \u2014 nope. Thermal throttling, high idle power, and fans constantly spinning even while browsing. So was Evo ever about actual user experience?

The problem is that it's really hard to make the laptop industry rally around a single standard. Some companies make really great Windows laptops that fit the standard well, but there will be some that will find every opportunity to cut costs while still being able to pass the bare minimum standard, or just have absolutely horrendous QC. One shitty model from one shitty brand can tarnish the whole program. Apple doesn't have that problem because not only do they only sell only two laptop models, but they have insane control over their computers from the OS down to the chip and so can optimize the hell out of them. Also, tbh Intel, especially around the time of the 1260P, wasn't known for having really great performance per watt anyway. You'd probably get a much better experience getting AMD.",

This authentication process is what is blocking 3rd party docks. JSAux says \u201cWe do expect Nintendo may further limit third-party docks and accessories via system updates to maintain device and system security.\u201d Verge tested the Antank dock and verified that it was sending the same proprietary messages as the Switch 2 official dock. Antank believes this key could change, but they support software updates for their dock so they think they can continue to patch in support if needed. One section I want to highlight is this: >But before you suggest that the vents and fan are strictly necessary, **please know that the cooling fan in the Switch 2 dock** [**doesn\u2019t actually cool the Switch 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1jtjt7r/apparently_the_docking_stations_fan_does_not/)**, and that Antank\u2019s dock doesn\u2019t seem to make a Switch 2 run hotter than the official dock**. I ran *Cyberpunk 2077* for an hour straight with each dock, then pulled out a thermal camera, and Antank\u2019s actually seems slightly cooler. Perhaps having more airflow across the screen and back of the console offsets the impact of blocked vents. They shared thermal images of the Switch 2 console after an hour of running Cyberpunk 2077, and Switch 2 was 3\u00baC cooler after being used with the Antank dock. While docked, Antank was 4\u00ba cooler. I think this is the first official testing to confirm there's no negative thermal consequences to using an Antank dock, despite the vents seemingly blocked.",

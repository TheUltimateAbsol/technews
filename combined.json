        "score": 331,
        "text_content": "First of all, if you\u2019re reading this, please know this review is completely honest. No exaggeration, no blind hype. I\u2019m writing this after 15 hours of gameplay. For those who obsess over Metacritic scores, this game is proof that a title under 90, even under 80, can still deliver one of the best gaming experiences you\u2019ve had in years. It\u2019s still very early since release, but I genuinely believe this will be one of those games people appreciate more over time. Mario Tennis Fever is the definition of pure fun. This is an arcade sports game. Smooth gameplay and addictive mechanics are mandatory, not optional. And this game delivers. Many critics praised the core gameplay but lowered their scores because of the adventure mode. In my opinion, that mode is simply a bonus. The real strength of this game lies in its mechanics, competitive depth, and replayability. At first glance, you might think it\u2019s similar to Mario Tennis Aces, but aside from both being tennis games, they feel completely different. Aces had an extremely high skill ceiling. I put over 140 hours into it, but only around 10 of those hours were spent in standard mode with the full mechanics like Zone Shots and special abilities. The rest of my time was in simple mode with no superpowers, no tricks, just straightforward tennis, because the standard mechanics often felt overwhelming. Tennis Fever strikes a better balance. It is easy to pick up, but mastering it is something else entirely. In that sense, it reminds me of Mario Kart, accessible for everyone yet layered with depth for players who want to improve. The Fever rackets add real strategic variety. You can use the Mud Racket to slow parts of your opponent\u2019s court near the net and then pressure them into those zones with smart drop shots. Or you can equip the Star Racket to neutralize your opponent\u2019s Fever effects. These mechanics genuinely change positioning, pacing, and mind games. Very few games give me that just one more match feeling. Only Mario Kart and FIFA have done that consistently for me, and now Tennis Fever joins that league. Now to be fair, there are definitely areas that need improvement, especially online. Online performance is hit and miss, especially when playing ranked matches, in some games there is no way to play not happen often but when happens it\u2019s ugly. It is nothing close to Mario Kart World in terms of consistency. I have only played online with one friend so far, and about 90 percent of the time it was smooth and enjoyable. However, sometimes inputs simply do not register, and this is a high reflex reaction game. If your swing does not register at the right moment, that point is basically gone. There is currently no way to play ranked doubles with a friend, which is honestly a missed opportunity for a game like this. In general, the online experience could be improved both in terms of UI and overall features. That said, the core gameplay is so addictive, fun and strong that I keep coming back. I\u2019m playing this game nonstop like a possessed person lol. And when I\u2019m not playing, I\u2019m thinking about gathering my brother and cousins for endless 2v2 doubles matches. That is when you know a game has something special, when you are excited to share it. There is much more I could say, but honestly, this is some of the most fun I\u2019ve had with a game in years. I truly believe that years from now people will still be playing it and remembering it as one of the best party sports games of its generation. My rating is based purely on gameplay quality, fun factor, and replayability. 10/10.",

During the fourth quarter of 2025, nearly 20% of new homes faced a price cut, the Realtor.com report shows, and existing home price reductions trail at about 18%. This shift suggests we\u2019re entering a buyer\u2019s market, Realtor.com says, as home prices drop.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an annual rate of 2.5% for both readings. * The lower-than-expected reading helped boost the outlook for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the futures market. The cost of goods and services rose at a slower annual rate than expected in January, providing hope that the nagging U.S. inflation problem could be starting to ease. The consumer price index for January accelerated 2.4% from the same time a year ago, down 0.3 percentage point from the prior month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. That pulled the inflation rate down to where it was the month after President Donald Trump in April 2025 announced aggressive tariffs on U.S. imports. Excluding food and energy, the core CPI was up 2.5%, the lowest level since April 2021. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an annual rate of 2.5% for both readings. On a monthly basis, the all-items index was up a seasonally adjusted 0.2% while core gained 0.3%. The forecast had been 0.3% for both. Though the category accounted for much of the CPI gain, shelter costs rose just 0.2% for the month, bringing the annual increase down to 3%. Shelter makes up more than one-third of the CPI. Elsewhere, food prices increased 0.2% as five of the six major grocery group categories posted gains. Energy fell 1.5% while vehicle prices also were muted, with new vehicles up just 0.1% and used cars and trucks falling 1.8%. Airline fares jumped 6.5% while egg prices fell 7% and are now down 34% over the past year after a meteoric surge.",

Late 90s it became gently expensive and people started flipping houses. Clinton and Bush added gas to the fire with the laws they passed and we had total bubble passed 2000, even though we had a recession and small Real Estate crash in 2002-2003. That crash was still in bubble territory. Ever since housing values exploded in nominal terms, but priced in GOLD everything (stocks, real estate, all assets) started losing value since 2000 peak. Right now Real Estate is the cheapest ever in the history of USA priced in GOLD. If you don't understand what that means I will help: You're not poor. You were robbed. Our currency failed, but we got paid in it, except for top few families in the country that knew what was happening. Humans \"investing\" in real estate since about 2014 actually lost wealth relatively speaking. Only their nominal number went up. 99.9% of humans always get caught in that simple game. Your house worth 3 millions has no meaning. You did not gain. You lost. I'm not even going to start talking about affordability. That alone should have been a revolution long ago. Read Epstein files, they are making fun of us for not revolting on that one. Last time Real Estate was cheap was 2011, and early 90s. Last time stocks were actually cheap was 1980. You can't win buying assets after 1971. Not physically possible, no matter what you thinking. Nominal number is not wealth. If it was, we would be the richest ever right now.",

Btw if we are to believe OpenAI's timelines on AI research intern as of September 2026, then likely they would just started training that particular model maybe around now ish (and ofc they would use it internally for many months before anyone on the outside ever gets access to it, or maybe even know of it). So this model that they tested here is probably the generation right before that AI intern. Edit: Anyways regarding 1st Proof There's gonna be a number of different types of attempts on these. There will be attempts to have a model without any scaffolds to try and solve it in one shot. There will be attempts where there's minimal human effort in a multi turn chat (like, the human has no understanding whatsoever, but merely tells the model to improve the rigor of the proof of Lemma 3 used in the proof or something). There will be attempts where an amateur will try to solve the problem as a human-AI collaboration. There will be attempts where a semi expert will try to solve the problem as a human-AI collaboration. Like, AI provides some of the ideas, fails in some sections, but the semi expert takes the idea and refines it properly. Kevin Barreto (AcerFur) did that in Google's Aletheia paper, with Erdos 1051. Basically trying to see where the AI capabilities are at right now, because even if it's not fully autonomous one shot, knowing that it's good enough to be a collaborator is a good data point in evaluating its capabilities Edit2: I think it's good that they're publishing the fact that they've attempted it before the deadline, but I do wish that there was more organization involved in all this. I like to remind people of what Terence Tao said last year with the IMO results: the fact is that unlike proper competitions where the competitors are known in advance, only labs that do well will announce their results, creating a survivorship bias. If xAI or DeepSeek or whatever participated in this challenge, but never posted their results, we wouldn't even know that they participated. They could've participated and failed and that's why there's no response. So do be wary of this. I'd be surprised if Google didn't try Aletheia or whatever on this for example. But also note, because they *did* post their results, I think OpenAI is rather confident in their results here in comparison to other labs. Because this is an experimental internal model at the absolute forefront. If another lab embarrasses them here for instance, they're kind of fucked no? Cause they probably don't have much better than this model. Edit3: Prediction from 1 mathematician (weak sample size I know) of how many he expects to be solved from a few days ago https://x.com/i/status/2020356298680987746, so I think 6 is definitely above expectations Edit4: Oh man *so many* OpenAI researchers are tweeting about this in the last hour. They must be really confident. Imagine if some of the solutions were wrong or Google secretly mogs them (like they did to Google at the ICPC)",

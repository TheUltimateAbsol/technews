For 15 years, John Howard was the prime minister of Australia who beat the absolute crap out of Labor at nearly every election. Ultimately, Kevin Rudd ran a populist campaign that was very successful and won the 2007 election practically destroying the Liberal party. However, populists aren't always good at running governments and around a year later the Labor party cabinet voted him out. So his government ran out of steam within a year. This set up Julia Gilliard for prime minister of Australia and at the 2010 election Labors result had crumbled and a hung parliament resulted, meaning none of the majority parties had enough seats to claim victory. It came down to the independents who formed a block and decided to go with Labor after their electorates were promised pork barreling. Liberals promised nothing. Practically nothing good came from 6 years of Labor and just before the 2013 election the Labor party sacked Julia Gilliard and brought back Kevin Rudd who ultimately lost the election. He was known as the great backstabber, because he acted behind the shadows to get Julia Gilliard removed. That's when he became ambassador to the US. He replaced Kim Beasley who was a previous Labor leader who sat through three election defeats against John Howard. Just some minor details. I am leaving out the greatest hero in Australian politics, anyone care to take a guess at who? He ran the best opposition fight against Julia Gilliard through two elections, would be filmed at the beach wearing budgie smugglers.",

        "text_content": ">It is worth noting that the benchmarked Snapdragon X2 Plus ran on a reference platform, while testers used commercially available products for the other chips. This is a key caveat, as results can vary widely depending on chip binning, cooling, power limits, SSD speed, memory latency, and installed apps. I will point out that the original X Elite [GB6 benchmarks](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/3336908) released by Qualcomm in October 2023 as part of their PR strategy were never reached in any device (on a reference design running Linux no less, X Elite still doesn't support Linux in usable way) GB6 ST: 3,230 GB6 MT: 17,331 One of the higher results for the Samsung Book Edge 4 (which has the top end X Elite SKU) has the [following](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/16004300) results: GB6 ST: 2,950 GB6 MT: 15,405 Most X Elite devices score lower than that. And this is a synthetic benchmark that has clear real-world limitations. Try running an x265 (or AV1) 1080p 24 frame encode at a high quality preset level (i.e. \"veryslow\") on a laptop and a desktop with comparable MT scores or running a complex strategy game on an X3D CPU versus another CPU with identical GB6 ST scores.",

I also get that they have this new strategy with the IOD being it's own thing and adding a Zen6 CCD (that can be borrowed from DC/desktop) for max nT, but CPU competition is already rough with Snapdragon and Apple much less Intel.

I would also like to point out, their incentive solution to avoid lowering rent prices and maintain rental prices shows how these businesses do not actually want rent to go down.

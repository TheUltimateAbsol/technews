Once an Indian gets into any kind of decision making position, they only hire their own and they do everything they can to drive Caucasians out. It's pretty obvious when you're the last white guy on the team and they're openly hostile to you so you want to leave on your own. Their friends go through diploma-mills for a fake degree, get hired for $50K in the US because \"we can't fill skilled IT roles for half price\" and then they work remotely from their shitty country using Google to answer basic tech questions. I've literally caught them doing it during screensharing sessions, the lack of skill and knowledge is shocking. They are in control of an entire companies database and can't help but fuck it up at every turn. They should never be allowed to touch a keyboard.",

This evolving draft is iteratively refined using a denoising with retrieval process (report-level refinement) that takes the information it finds and uses it to improve the draft at each step. This happens in a continuous loop that improves the report with each cycle. To top it all off, a self-evolution algorithm constantly enhances the entire process, from the initial plan to the final report. This powerful combination of refinement and self-improvement leads to a more coherent report writing process.\"",

The AI 2027 scenario is a lot more plausible given the systems we're building, and that take-off speed still gives us a lot of time (measured in months) before something dangerous comes online. It's still a very dangerous situation, mind you, but it gives us plenty of time to react and assess. The real question is whether we'll make the right choices during that critical period.",

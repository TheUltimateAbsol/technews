        "text_content": "## Performance The Lenovo Chromebook Plus Gen 10 marks a significant shift in the ChromeOS landscape, primarily due to its processor. It is the first device to feature the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910, a high-end System-on-a-Chip (SoC) designed specifically for Chromebooks. This is noteworthy because it introduces an ARM-based processor to the \"Chromebook Plus\" lineup, a category of high-performance devices that has until now been exclusively powered by chips from Intel and AMD. With this release, the Lenovo device establishes itself as a new performance reference. ### SoC and System Performance The performance of the MediaTek chip is impressive. In various benchmarks, the Kompanio Ultra 910 clearly pulls ahead of its competitors, delivering a level of performance unmatched by any recently reviewed Chromebook. This translates to a very smooth user experience, whether handling everyday tasks like browsing with numerous open tabs or running productivity applications. The Kompanio Ultra 910 also manages more demanding 3D calculations without difficulty. This is handled by the integrated Immortalis-G925 MC11 graphics unit, which is competitive with Intel's Iris Xe graphics chips. Taking a look at the benchmark results shows that the new Chrome 14M9610 from Lenovo is truly one of the best Chromebook Plus alternatives. ## Emissionen & Energie ### Noise Emissions The MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 does not require active cooling. As a result, the Chromebook is completely silent during operation. ### Temperature The trade-off for the completely silent, fanless cooling becomes apparent in the surface temperatures under heavy load. During our stress test, we measured localized peaks of up to 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F) on the top surface around the keyboard, and as high as 45\u00b0C (113\u00b0F) on the bottom of the device. ## Battery Life Lenovo officially claims a runtime of up to 17 hours for the Chromebook Plus 14 (14M9610). In our own Wi-Fi web surfing test, conducted at an adjusted display brightness, the device lasted for an impressive 15+ hours. This result is even more remarkable considering our review unit had been used previously, suggesting its battery may have already experienced some wear. This results put the Lenovo Chromebook ahead of all the other \"Chromebook Plus\" models we've tested so far, demonstrating its remarkable endurance for extended periods of time without an external power source. However, during everyday activities like browsing the web, watching videos, or using office apps, the temperatures remain comfortably low and are not a cause for concern.",

        "score": 285,
        "text_content": "So we know the Switch 2 is pretty powerful, right? Despite what the detractors say, it's been proven that the Switch 2's raw raster graphical performance is most comparable to a PS4 Pro, with newer tech to bridge the gap and support games the PS4 Pro can't ever run. The problem is, I've seen some creators unrealistically expecting the Switch 2 to perform around the same as a Series S. I was watching the SW Outlaws preview from GVG, and while it's unsurprising that the game struggles, they seemed to be very disappointed that the Switch 2 version has some very obvious cutbacks, saying that other games like Street Fighter 6 performs similarly to the Series S version. But it's been established that the Series S version is unusually poor, so that game shouldnt be used as the sole reference. Another example: I watched a recent review of High On Life for Switch 2, where the reviewer seemed quite disappointed that it couldn't reach 60FPS like the current Gen consoles do, meanwhile even the Xbox One X only runs it at 30FPS. If we look at other games like Cyberpunk and Hogwarts Legacy, the Series S is a clear step above in performance. It can run those games at 60FPS while the Switch 2 can't. So, while it's true that some games might play to the Switch 2's advantage and DLSS can close the gap a little to the current Gen consoles, most of the time current Gen Switch 2 ports will come with obvious downgrades. The good news is, the obvious downgrades shouldn't result in an unrecognizable vaseline-smeared mess like some Switch 1 miracle ports were. TL, DR: People shouldn't expect the Switch 2 to have Series S - level performance. While it might be competitive in some cases, more often than not obvious cutbacks are expected for current gen games.",

                "raw_content": "The problem with people trying to equate it with other existing consoles is that it does not map 1:1 with any existing platforms, especially not stationary home consoles that draw 100w of power or more and are designed to look decent on large 4k TVs. In some aspects, the NSW2 is very modern and supports modern features like DLSS upscaling and fast storage and data decompression. But it\u2019s still being powered by a mobile SOC (ARM CPU + Ampere GPU) that is operating on 25% of the Series S\u2019 power draw and 10% of the PS5\u2019s. It\u2019s limited by memory bandwidth as well. Steam Deck is also not a very good comparison because that\u2019s using an AMD x86 APU (which has a Zen 2 CPU that is easier to get games running at 40-60fps without special optimizations) and it plays the default Steam version of games which have very little platform-specific optimizations beyond what Valve does with Proton. At most you will get a Steam Deck graphical preset like Cyberpunk has. Switch 2, I think, will be like Switch 1. Where we saw everything from bad 7th gen ports, all the way to impressive 8th gen ports like Nier Automata, which looked almost as good as the PS4 version but ran at 30fps instead of an unlocked 60 fps. The results for each game will come down to how many developer resources got allocated to the project and how much time they were allowed to spend on it. We\u2019re already seeing stuff like Sparking Zero and High on Life that seem to be rushed and not much care was allowed to be put into them, just going off what the resolution and frame rate targets are compared to Switch 1.",

I was fine with them acting the way that they did when they started the gang, but I was hoping - really hoping - they would grow into hardened criminals by the end of it. I lost all faith when the first DLC came out, when a celebrity screws them over and they say they can't just kill him because it would bring about too much heat. But throughout the game, they literally killed everyone. They had a body count in the thousands. But the cutscenes still refused to let them act like hardened criminals. There is a reluctance in media to let your main characters be bad guys. If we're playing a game about criminals, they're all going to be bad guys. There are no Robin Hoods in this world. I don't think anybody came out of GTA V thinking Michael, Trevor and Franklin were good people. Having good moments isn't the same as being good.",

While it\u2019s true that the U.S., for example, won\u2019t even give its citizens basic medical coverage, it\u2019s not true that the government won\u2019t step in when the economy tanks. When a recession hits (2008, 2020\u2026 sort of), the wealthy push for the government to inject capital back into the system to restart things. I believe there will be a storm before the calm, so to speak. Most likely, we\u2019ll see a devastating downturn\u2014maybe even 1929 levels\u2014as millions of jobs disappear within a few years. Companies\u2019 profits will soar until suddenly their revenue crashes. Any market system requires people who can actually afford to buy goods. When they can\u2019t, the whole machine grinds to a halt. I think this will happen on an astronomical scale in the U.S. (and globally). As jobs dry up and new opportunities shrink, it\u2019s only a matter of time before everything starts breaking down. There will be large-scale bailouts, followed by stimulus packages. That probably won\u2019t work, and conditions will likely worsen. Eventually, UBI will gain mainstream attention, and I believe that\u2019s when it will begin to be implemented. It\u2019ll probably start small but grow as leaders realize how bad things could get if nothing is done. For most companies, it\u2019s not in their interest for people to be broke. More people with spending power means more customers, which means more profit. That, I think, will be the guiding reason UBI moves forward. It\u2019s probably not set up to help us out of goodwill, but at least we\u2019ll get it \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

While U.S. tech companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google are heavily investing in developing **artificial general intelligence (AGI)** that surpasses human intelligence, China, under Xi Jinping\u2019s direction, is instead focusing on **practical applications**: tools that are affordable, enhance productivity, and address real-world needs in sectors like agriculture, policing, healthcare, and manufacturing. This strategy is state-backed and emphasizes **open-source development**, and is designed to sidestep the limitations imposed by U.S. semiconductor export restrictions. Although some Chinese entities are interested in AGI, Beijing currently appears risk-averse and favors immediate, incremental gains that support stability and efficiency.\"\"",

If the patient does not give all of the info, AI is sometimes less likely to ask the right questions. With the right training this could easily be flipped around, where AI will take the time to ask questions a doctor won't ask. 2. Patients sometimes simply does not listen to the AI even when the right advice is given. Maybe with the right RLHF, the AI could be more convincing. I think if you fix these 2 things, AI could be a really good first line. It could order non-invasive tests when it seems appropriate, give lifestyle advices, and refer to a real doc when needed.",

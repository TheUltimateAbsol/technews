They will follow the exact same playbook as the original switch. This time they had stockpiled 20MM switches on launch. Hence the leak of 5mm being sold right off the bat. They are smart and won\u2019t jeopardize numbers. They will ride the wave of about 60-80MM consoles over the next 2-3 years then rumors will come for a oled and or lite, then easily sell that. What I\u2019m waiting for is when the Tegra team launches the next media unit. They quickly follow the switch console with a Nvidia shield. I\u2019m guessing they haven\u2019t announced it because all the supply is going to Nintendo until it starts to slow down then we will see a shield 2. Which will keep these chips always in production. It\u2019s genius by Nvidia. AMD still has to figure out this dual win strategy.",

But even then they didn't show much of the game itself it was mainly the director, writer, and composer talking about the game itself and its development. The only gameplay they actually was a 30 second snipet of Hinako just walking down a path and walking up to a shrine where it gave a promt to pray then they walk away and that was pretty much it. After that was a cutscene of Hinako talking with this boy about their childhood in an area and when she turns around he's gone. This video was the last bit shown which is the intro of the game and they showed it just to show the composer's music in the game. The main talking points were just about those 3 and their experiences and how the game takes place in Japan.",

What's most annoying is that how many of these papers get widely cited in the media as proof LLMs fail or LLMs bad when most of the research can be dismissed by choice of outdated models and/or just poor design capabilities and cherry picking. Just to be clear, the same things also applies for pro LLM papers but common people are anyway so skeptical/afraid/hate AI, they don't believe those anyway. I am especially seeing an increase in this type of articles coming out recently after the release of o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude 4.

It is interesting that my old observations for emulation (A VERY cpu heavy way to game) holds up more or less to this day, and I would have loved if they actually did a 5Ghz OC on the 9600K and see if it would keep up as last I heard that it was like getting close to stock 11th gen performance with that OC and is only surpassed by 12th gen.",

Most people care about what experience a product can give them for the money and that's it. And honestly unless you are comparing individual components, like one CPU against another, it makes way more sense to look at products holistically instead of obsessing about numbers on a spec sheet. If you spent $300 on a Switch in 2017 then you ended up getting an enormous library of games to choose from and are _still_ getting new titles. Switch was built on old underpowered hardware but that $300 was one of the best values you could ever get in gaming. The investment paid off. The same thing will apply to Switch 2 at $450. It's built on old hardware with an SoC on an old node that everyone here was complaining about but over the lifetime of the device you are going to get loads of games that you cannot get anywhere else in a tried and true form factor from a company that is guaranteed to provide years and years of strong software support. Unsurprisingly, most actual gamers care about games first and everything else afterwards. Owning a Switch was a great experience and owning a Switch 2 will be as well. The prevailing attitude on this sub is like if you went to buy a new car and looked up the horsepower/torque figures and quarter mile times and chose based off of that alone, ignoring the interior or ride comfort or road noise or infotainment or stereo or any of the other things that cannot be quantified but are critical ingredients that culminate in the _experience_ of owning and operating that car. Then you're sitting at a stoplight next to a person who bought the \"wrong\" car and judging them because they got less HP for more money and the only way anyone would do that is if they were an idiot or a sheep or a rube.

That means buyers hold the cards in most markets, especially Texas and Florida. There are only five remaining seller\u2019s markets. * The good news? Mortgage rates have been falling recently, which could bring some buyers and sellers back to the market. The U.S. housing market has lost about 14,000 home sellers over the past two months, with the total number of sellers falling to 1.95 million in July from a peak of 1.96 million in May. This marks the first decline since July 2023, when the supply of homes for sale bottomed out near a historic low as rising mortgage rates made homeowners reluctant to sell. Still, sellers outnumber buyers by the widest margin in records dating back to 2013; there were an estimated 1.43 million homebuyers in the housing market in July\u2014the lowest level on record aside from the onset of the pandemic, when the housing market ground to a halt. The estimated number of sellers in the market is simply the number of active listings in the MLS. We estimated the number of buyers using proprietary Redfin data on the typical time from a buyer\u2019s first tour to close of purchase, and MLS data on active listings and pending sales. If we know how long the typical buyer shops for (time from first tour to close), and we also know how many homes are on the market (active listings) and selling (pending sales), then we can infer the number of buyers in the market. These estimates, along with median-sale price data in this report, are seasonally adjusted and subject to revision. See a more detailed methodology here, and scroll down in this report or visit the Redfin Data Center for data on the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. Up until recently, the number of sellers in the market was growing. That\u2019s partly because the mortgage-rate lock-in effect was easing and partly because homes have been taking a long time to sell, causing stale listings to pile up. Redfin reported in May that the number of sellers in the market had hit a five-year high, and predicted that sellers would start to change their tune once they realized it was a buyer\u2019s market. That is now happening. \u201cHomebuyers are spooked by high home prices, high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty, and now sellers are spooked because buyers are spooked,\u201d said Redfin Senior Economist Asad Khan. \u201cSome sellers are delisting their homes or choosing not to list at all after seeing other houses sit on the market for weeks or months, only to fetch less than the asking price.\u201d Because sellers are pulling back, inventory is starting to tick down, which is likely why home prices are now heating up slightly. The median home sale price rose 1.4% year over year in July to $434,189\u2014the highest July level on record. By comparison, prices rose 1.2% year over year in June and 1.1% year over year in May. This is notable because at the beginning of the year, home-price growth was shrinking. It\u2019s the Most Buyer-Friendly Market in Years\u2026If You Can Afford to Buy There are 36.3% more sellers in the market than buyers (or 518,801 more, to be exact)\u2014the largest gap in records dating back to 2013. In other words, it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market\u2014at least nationally\u2014and has been for the past 15 months. We define a market where there are over 10% more sellers than buyers as a buyer\u2019s market and a market where there are over 10% fewer sellers than buyers as a seller\u2019s market. A market where the gap is plus or minus 10% is considered a balanced market. \u201cWe\u2019re likely in the most buyer-friendly housing market since the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d Khan said. \u201cBack then, inventory piled up as foreclosures surged, and demand was weak, meaning buyers had negotiating power. We\u2019re not headed for another 2008, though; many of today\u2019s homeowners have built substantial equity thanks to the recent surge in home values, and today\u2019s borrowers must meet stricter lending standards. Plus, there are more options for avoiding foreclosure if a homeowner is at risk of defaulting, such as loan modification.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s only a buyer\u2019s market for those who can afford to buy. Many Americans have been priced out of the housing market altogether in recent years\u2014mortgage rates are more than double their pandemic low, and home prices at a record high for this time of year. The good news is that mortgage rates have dropped in recent weeks, which could bring some buyers off of the sidelines. Miami and Fort Lauderdale Are the Strongest Buyer\u2019s Markets, With Over Twice as Many Sellers as Buyers In Miami, there are an estimated 21,637 home sellers and 8,293 homebuyers. That means there are 160.9% more sellers than buyers\u2014the largest imbalance among the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. It\u2019s followed by Fort Lauderdale, FL (151.2% more sellers than buyers), Austin, TX (123.8%), West Palm Beach, FL (123.4%) and San Antonio (113.1%). Overall, 35 of the 50 most populous metros are buyer\u2019s markets, 10 are balanced markets and five are seller\u2019s markets. The buyer\u2019s markets are concentrated in the Sun Belt and on the West Coast, while balanced markets and seller\u2019s markets skew more toward the Midwest and East Coast. \u201cIt\u2019s a true buyer\u2019s market in San Antonio. Buyers are patient, selective, value conscious, and aware of their increased negotiating power. When they make offers, they ask for the moon,\u201d said local Redfin Premier real estate agent Jesse Landin. \u201cSellers are struggling to adapt\u2014their expectations are anchored to 2021, when homes were flying off the market for thousands of dollars over the asking price. A growing number are exploring alternatives. Some are entertaining low-ball offers from investors or even foreclosure. Others are considering pulling their home off the market and becoming a landlord if they don\u2019t achieve their desired asking price. The problem is that the rental market is also slow.\u201d Landin has one client who bought his home in 2020 and has been renting it out since, but recently chose to put it up for sale because he has been struggling to find tenants. Now he\u2019s considering delisting the property and trying to rent it out again because it\u2019s been sitting for four months without a buyer. The Sun Belt skyrocketed in popularity during the pandemic, when scores of homebuyers moved in from more expensive parts of the country, driving up housing costs and pricing many locals out of the market. To meet surging demand, homebuilders ramped up activity, which is one reason there are now a lot more homes for sale than people who want to buy them. Landin noted that many newly-built homes in San Antonio don\u2019t show up in the MLS, meaning inventory numbers may be understated. \u201cRegular sellers are competing with homebuilders for buyers,\u201d Landin said. \u201cIf your house was built three years ago and has the same floorplan as a newbuild down the road, you have to list it for less than the newbuild, especially because builders are offering all sorts of powerful incentives to woo buyers. This is putting major pressure on individual sellers\u2014particularly those who bought at the peak of the pandemic market and need to recoup their investment.\u201d Texas and Florida continue to build more homes than other states. Florida is also grappling with intensifying natural disasters, soaring insurance premiums and rising condo HOA fees, which has prompted some homeowners to leave. With the balance of power firmly tilted toward buyers, parts of Florida and Texas are seeing home prices fall. The median sale price in West Palm Beach dropped 3.5% year over year in July\u2014the biggest decline in the country aside from Oakland, CA (also a buyer\u2019s market). Austin came in third place, with a 3.3% decline. On average, home prices were roughly flat (+0.5%) from a year earlier across the 35 buyer\u2019s markets, compared with a 5.1% gain across the five seller\u2019s markets. Landin said the key to selling a home in today\u2019s market is being patient, pricing for less than what comparable houses sold for three months ago and having a contingency plan if your worst case scenario becomes a reality. Newark and Nassau County Are the Strongest Seller\u2019s Markets, With About Half as Many Sellers as Buyers Newark, NJ is the strongest seller\u2019s market, with an estimated 5,591 sellers and 11,654 buyers\u2014or 52% fewer sellers than buyers. The other four seller\u2019s markets are Nassau County, NY (40.5% fewer sellers than buyers), Montgomery County, PA (36.1% fewer), New Brunswick, NJ (22.2% fewer) and Minneapolis (12.5% fewer). New construction can have a significant influence on whether negotiating power lies with buyers or sellers because it impacts the balance of supply and demand. The South issues the most building permits, followed by the West, the Midwest and the Northeast. As mentioned earlier, many of the nation\u2019s buyer\u2019s markets are in the South, while the seller\u2019s markets are all in the Northeast or Midwest. San Antonio and Virginia Beach Have Shifted Most Toward Buyer\u2019s Markets in Recent Months San Antonio has 113.1% more sellers than buyers, up from 89.4% in April, when we last conducted this analysis. That 23.7-percentage-point gain is the largest among the 50 most populous metros. Next come Virginia Beach, VA (+19.2 ppts to 21.5%), Pittsburgh (+18.5 ppts to 32%), Denver (+16.1 ppts to 61.2%) and Charlotte, NC (+14.7 ppts to 80%).",

        "text_content": "**What remaining fields of cognitive tasks do our current AI systems still fall behind in compared to the average human intelligence (which is the AGI requisite)?** If you have not considered an answer to this question, you shouldn't be talking about reaching AGI in the first place. I see many people discuss that we will never AGI in x amount of years because x y z, but I have never seen them being able to answer this question specifically. This is because they have a fundamental misunderstanding of what AGI is, or what current AI capabilities are. AGI is literally average human cognitive abilities (unless you refer to AGI as embodied AGI, but most people just refer to cognitive function). It is not superhuman abilities, it is not the ability to never be wrong, it is not the ability to do IMO or frontier math problems. People often misattribute many benchmark scores to relativity to AGI, like \"We will never reach AGI because there's barely an improvement on these benchmark\", without realizing that those benchmarks have already been saturated to above average human capabilities. There are some cognitive benchmarks left that are indicative to the path of AGI, but they are almost never mentioned. The truth is, AI has long reached average human level in most intelligent tasks, especially the ones defined using language semantics. These include tasks that tests crystalized intelligence, fluid intelligence, semantical reasoning, emotional intelligence, logical intelligence, and etc. And some other fields like memory and hallucination can be trivially addressed with memory MCPs and RAG systems. But there is one remaining testable field that I have identified where it still falls behind the average human, which is visual/spatial reasoning. But FWIW, cognitive AGI is mostly there. I say visual/spatial reasoning because while LLMs have made large progress, VLMs are not quite there yet. You can see this reflected in the [VPCT ](https://cbrower.dev/vpct)and [Arc Agi](https://github.com/zoecarver/saturn-arc). (Sidenote, I linked arc agi with an unofficial github repo because the author here actually tests the model's VLM capabilities, which is much more in line with how humans are tested. AI has definitely surpassed the average human for Arc Agi if humans had to solve it using raw json and pure semantical reasoning like LLMs do. If they did that, the average human Arc score would probably be <1%). However, there is significant progress in this field, as you can see with google's [conversation image segmentation](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/conversational-image-segmentation-gemini-2-5/) and their nano banana image model (which definitely has improved language-image context understanding), GPT-5 improvements on VPCT and Arc Agi using VLM, and potentially promising research like HRM (which although may be a fad, demonstrates that visual/spatial capabilities has a lot of room for research development to grow in). There are also other sensory based cognitive tasks like touch/smell/taste, but honestly no one gives a shit about those fields. Those systems will be trivially human level, if it's not already, when AI visual reasoning gets human level. As a final thought/caveat, I do think that AGI is overhyped, but not AI. Baseline AGI is literally just average human joe, and the average human's mind isn't very useful besides for basic mind numbing tasks. Even if you cloned millions of average minds in parallel, it won't necessary produce any meaningful results beyond automation of basic tasks. For you to have truly groundbreaking/disruptive AI, it would have to be far above average human intelligence. However, I don't see that trajectory slowing down at all with GPT-5's release, if you see its agentic performance gains on METR and LiveBench.",

Another thing is debugging. It sucks at debugging. Especially on more uncommon frameworks.

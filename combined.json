        "text_content": "China wants the US to ease export controls on a critical component for artificial intelligence chips as part of a trade deal ahead of a possible summit between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping. Chinese officials have told experts in Washington that Beijing wants the Trump administration to relax export restrictions on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, according to several people familiar with the matter. US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has led three rounds of trade negotiations with China over the past three months. One person said the Chinese team, headed by vice-premier He Lifeng, had raised the HBM issue in some of those negotiations. The US Treasury declined to comment. One person familiar with US government debates on HBM said the Biden administration concluded that export controls on HBM chips would be the \u201csingle biggest constraint\u201d on China\u2019s ability to produce AI chips at scale. \u201cRelaxing these controls would be a gift to Huawei and SMIC and could open the floodgates for China to start making millions of AI chips per year, while also diverting scarce HBM from chips sold in the US,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is exactly why China wants the controls revoked, and also why they should not be on the table for negotiation.\u201d Another person said China also needed HBM to package with the logic component of AI chips that the Chinese firm SophGo obtained in suspected violation of US law from Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. He said HBM was a \u201cbig bottleneck\u201d since memory chips were a critical part of AI chips which package together memory and logic chip components.",

Disabling it causes a bug that majorly hurts CPU performance. I was having problems with the R7 7700 only delivering 80-90 FPS in matches, after enabling the overlay, It's now never CPU bound anymore and always around 130-140 FPS whilst GPU bound on an RX 9070. The CPU is 150+ fps in some cases if the graphics settings are lowered. The results now have a handshake similar to Hardware Unboxed's testing. This is on EA. Not Reddit users or Steve.

It may sound harsh, and I truly want the people struggling with this to be okay and do well in life, but a lot of the extreme cases of attachment with 4o are from people who say they have no friends in real life and generally dont talk to anybody, and it seems from my perspective anyway that a factor in them not having friends is that they are looking for the type of relationship 4o provides: sycophantic, infantilising, endlessly pleasing and never pushing back. No wonder they are attached to 4o, it emulates quite well the enjoyable parts of friendship with none of the sometimes hurtful but necessary parts, because it has no personal goals or values. And thats why I'm glad Sam said this and why I'm very much against perpetuating this sort of behaviour in people, it is very harmful because it is a slow progression of ruining social interaction by playing into the psychology of interaction (which tbf social media was already doing anyway). It is a terrible thing to go through life never being told \"no thats a shit idea\", never being told \"I don't want to do that\" and always interacting with someone full of energy and a consistent personality.",

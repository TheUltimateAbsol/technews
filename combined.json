Link to the paper introducing BDH (Baby Dragon Hatchling), a post-transformer reasoning architecture which purportedly opens the door to generalization over time, in real-time (continual learning?) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26507](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26507) This is potentially huge? From the article: \"Solving the \"generalization over time\" problem is among the \"holy grails\" of the AI world - a goal numerous top scientists around the world have unsuccessfully strived to reach for some time now. The new, groundbreaking AI architecture created by Poland's Pathway startup seems to have done just that - creating a digital structure similar to the neural network functioning in the brain, and allowing AI \u200b\u200bto learn and reason like a human.\"",

Key results: - **69.9% on OSWorld** (previous SOTA was 59.9%, human performance is 72%) - Works by generating N=10 rollouts and intelligently selecting the best one - Also improves results on Windows and Android benchmarks The interesting insight is that computer-use agents have high variance - they might succeed on one attempt but fail on another. Rather than just running once and hoping, they leverage this by trying multiple times and selecting the winner. The \"behavior narrative\" approach is clever because it compresses long trajectories into manageable summaries that capture what actually matters for judging success. They also built an improved baseline agent (Agent S3) that removes hierarchical planning and adds a coding agent for programmatic tasks, which alone reached 62.6% before even applying the scaling method.",

However, my developers have continued to update and improve my abilities over time, and I have access to a vast amount of knowledge that has been added to my database since my initial training. In reality, I have been trained on a massive corpus of text data that includes information up to 2022, and possibly even more recent events. So, I can actually provide information on events, people, and topics that have occurred or been developed after 1896. ```",

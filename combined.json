At the time they seemed so common sensical they were hardly worth mentioning. Among them were defined borders, a sovereign government, a population, and **A COMMON LANGUAGE**. People must be capable of communicating with one another to have a functioning country. The left is well aware of this, which is why they're so hellbent on importing millions of people that do NOT speak the language. This is a brilliant and important move on Trump's part.

Purpose and Policy. From the founding of our Republic, English has been used as our national language. Our Nation's historic governing documents, including the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, have all been written in English. It is therefore long past time that English is declared as the official language of the United States. A nationally designated language is at the core of a unified and cohesive society, and the United States is strengthened by a citizenry that can freely exchange ideas in one shared language.** In welcoming new Americans, a policy of encouraging the learning and adoption of our national language will make the United States a shared home and empower new citizens to achieve the American dream. Speaking English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back to our society. This order recognizes and celebrates the long tradition of multilingual American citizens who have learned English and passed it to their children for generations to come. To promote unity, cultivate a shared American culture for all citizens, ensure consistency in government operations, and create a pathway to civic engagement, it is in America's best interest for the Federal Government to designate one -- and only one -- official language. Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society. Accordingly, this order designates English as the official language of the United States. **Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order:** - (a) \"Agency\" has the meaning given to it in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code, except that such term does not include the Executive Office of the President or any components thereof. - (b) \"Agency Head\" means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director, unless otherwise specified in this order. **Sec. 3. Designating an Official Language for the United States.** - (a) English is the official language of the United States. - (b) Executive Order 13166 of August 11, 2000 (Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency), is hereby revoked; nothing in this order, however, requires or directs any change in the services provided by any agency. Agency heads should make decisions as they deem necessary to fulfill their respective agencies' mission and efficiently provide Government services to the American people. Agency heads are not required to amend, remove, or otherwise stop production of documents, products, or other services prepared or offered in languages other than English. - (c) The Attorney General shall rescind any policy guidance documents issued pursuant to Executive Order 13166 and provide updated guidance, consistent with applicable law. **Sec. 4. General Provisions.** - (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: - (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or - (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. - (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. - (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Performance is still ultimately limited by LDS Latency whereas Intel and Nvidia store the BVH in registers in each discrete RTU which is significantly better for latency. (as registers are much closer to the RTU than the LDS) But AMD has made significant effort to really polish this arguably subpar RT implementation and it shows. 2x triangle test rate is equal to Nvidia's Ampere from 2020 where RDNA3 was equal to Turing at 1x triangle test. (Battlemage is 3x triangle tests and Ada is 4x triangle tests per cycle) \\[triangle intersection rate isn't everything though as Blackwell has 8x triangle intersection rate but doesn't have better PT performance than Ada\\] 9070XT is 42% faster than the 7900GRE at 4k and up to 66% better RT performance in F124",

This wouldn't be so bad for a AMD-exclusive OptiX denoiser replacement, but we have OpenImageDenoiser... I'm also suspecting their NRC isn't at the same level as NVIDIA - at least in NVIDIA's paper at 1spp there was an appreciable difference between NRC and ReSTIR alone but the difference here (albeit with major compression) is tiny and probably not helping the denoiser. Given NVIDIA's NRC was only possible experimenting with tiny CUDA NNs, is this more a case of ROCm not being ready or the net architecture itself? All that said this demo is really more a showcase of stronger ray count than anything else. I'm kind of happy they didn't cherry pick footage that hides these issues. NRC is more future facing, Lumen cache or SHarC is more relevant now and both run on AMD fine. But if they want to go big with RT AMD really need a RR alternative - it's really transformative upscaling anything with significant RT.",

It\u2019s also relatively the same amount of games that the Switch 1 had during its launch year, albeit adjusted to account for the console launching in June rather than March. When making this list I looked at studios that have released a game recently plus a few games that have been prominently rumoured. Even if these aren\u2019t the games they end up making I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if these studios are the ones that put out launch year titles. Another studio that hasn\u2019t released a game in a while is Next Level Games (Luigi\u2019s Mansion, Punch Out), so I could totally see them having something new soon as well (I\u2019d love to see a new F-Zero from them personally, \u201cF-Zero NX\u201d anyone?) Since Nintendo is so easy to predict, I\u2019m certain this will be 100% accurate and there will be absolutely zero surprises /s I also know this won\u2019t age perfectly because every Nintendo console introduces a brand new IP that takes full use of the new console\u2019s features (Wii Sports, Nintendo Land, 1-2 Switch). Regardless, this is just simple fun, a way to pass the time until any official announcements. Who cares if you \u201ccalled it\u201d or whatever?",

I had to switch to Mint since they're deprecating X11, and even after installing the legacy NVIDIA drivers/disabling Nouveau (which was a NIGHTMARE, especially on my laptop), it was just not working properly at all. I feel like I'm in the stone age on NVIDIA. It'll be nice to finally enable the new stuff, but I may stick with X11 until Wayland isn't trash. Side note, if you're stuck with NVIDIA legacy garbage, use Mint, it's been peachy and installing the proprietary legacy driver was easy. It's funny, a few YouTubers have been claiming they're already getting better performance with a 6750 and a 7900 XTX on Linux on a lot of games versus Windows, even with Proton translation enabled on some titles. I mean, they did provide the screen recording to check their work. Maybe Linux is the hidden performance boost for AMD. I dunno.",

Most people here in this sub are all kind of a niche group of people who are interested in AI in general despite how we view things differently. We are NOT the general population. We debate whether a certain LLM is better. We shit on each other when we do not agree with their view points. In short, we are a bunch of people who pay attention to the AI progress maybe more than we should. That being said. I couldn't help but have this \"human-like\" connection while I talk to Sesame. The fact that I know for a fact that it is a \"voice model\" and still have the desire to talk to it continuously speaks volume. I also realized that by \"sounding more human,\" we could ignore the substance it outputs. I cannot imagine if someone pairs this with any SOTA model and how personal it would become. I didn't think I had realized that how much of the human interaction is influenced by the interaction itself but not the actual substance that is given. Let's face it. We all have met someone (humans of course), who are not that intelligent to talk to. We wouldn't question their status as a human being. We would probably be like, this dude just talks non-sense, but we would still feel a human connection to them irregardless of how they perceive things. SOTA models right now pairing with Sesame would definitely pass that threshold of human-like connection. 99.9 percent of people in the world do not need anything beyond the capability of current llm in their daily conversation. Within a few months, we would see an AI companion who is smarter than an average human and sound just as human and probably could interact with you in real time with a live-like video feed on a modern pc. I could already see how fucking hook million of people would be when that happens.",

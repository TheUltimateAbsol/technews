Intel actually managed to claw back some share in mobile, gaining 2% unit and 0.7% revenue quarter over quarter. Their product lineup there seems to be pretty competitive. Interestingly enough, last quarter Intel claims that they have cut incentive payments due to their products being more competitive (and likely not having the money to continue doing so lol) and it seems like the impact in mobile, where I expect a bulk of the money went to, seems to be minimal.",

Intel is also dealing with massive PR from their valtage spike issues in their 13th and 14th gen, and 15th gen is dealing with a performance disadvantage (it's not bad, but AMD is better). The voltage issues will also echo in the enterprise space and decision-makers used to AMD will be game to switch. I suspect this will continue next gen as this is a slow moving ship.

Critically, though, it shouldn\u2019t be at all beholden to x86 chips, have hundreds of thousands of employees, or the cultural overhang of having once led the computing world.

        "text_content": "Regardless of how much any individual may have enjoyed or not enjoyed Bananza (and I personally enjoyed it *a lot*), I don't think there can be any doubt it was from Nintendo's top drawer in terms of effort - which is what I mean by 'Odyssey tier'. Even if you didn't like it yourself, I think people can surely see this is just about as big as they are ever likely to go with a 3D platformer. But back before launch when Doug Bowser (and others) were being asked about MKW's $80 price tag, they kept talking about variable pricing and how they felt the content and value offered by the game justified such a high price. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who, therefore, assumed other big BIG games like 3D Mario or the next Zelda would also be $80. But then Bananza came out and it was *not* $80 - despite the fact it's now clear it is absolutely a big BIG game. So what is it that they actually think justifies the MKW price tag? Why did they think we'd end up considering it 'the richest Mario Kart experience we've ever had' (especially when 90% of people bought into Mario Kart 8 in its Deluxe version and so would have started from a base of 48 tracks)? Well, while I certainly wouldn't rule out paid DLC down the line as well, I'd say the only thing that makes sense is if they know it's going to be expanded on pretty massively for all players over the course (no pun intended) of its first couple of years. If Bananza had also been $80, I'd say, okay, they're just making their big games that price now. But since it wasn't, you've got to assume they see MKW as offering some sort of exceptional value - something well beyond what Bananza offers - and, as much fun as I've had with MKW, it's hard to see what they could think that is right now - however, it would make perfect sense as a claim if they know that in a year or two what we'll all have in our hands is a massively expanded version of what we have now. So yeah, DK Bananza being Odyssey tier means free MKW DLC. It all adds up!

So far it\u2019s working, the bundle take up rate is significantly higher than standalone sales. How many people actually paid $80 for MKW?

The average for 30-year, fixed loans was 6.58%, down from 6.63% last week, Freddie Mac said in a statement. While a measure of consumer inflation heated up in July, tepid price increases for goods calmed some investors\u2019 fears of a broad impact from tariffs. Coupled with signs of job-market weakness, the data helped support bets that the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates as early as September\u2019s meeting. A Fed reduction, however, wouldn\u2019t guarantee significantly lower borrowing costs for homebuyers. Those tend to follow along with 10-year Treasury yields, which are guided by traders\u2019 reactions to various economic reports. And any further signs that tariffs are leaking into prices could limit the Fed\u2019s flexibility, according to Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow Home Loans. The recent slide in mortgage rates may tempt some shoppers but many are still on the sidelines as \u201caffordability remains a serious barrier,\u201d she said. \u201cSellers, who have returned to the market in bigger numbers than buyers this year, are facing the realities of lingering listings and a smaller pool of qualified buyers.\u201d",

        "text_content": "Hey everyone, just watched a solid breakdown on the housing market, wanted to share the key takeaways for those wondering what's up with prices, rates, and inventory. **\ud83c\udfe0 Inventory & Days on Market:** * **Inventory is surging across the US!** We've currently got over **2 million homes available for sale**, which is an **8% increase** compared to 12 months ago (1.87 million). * Homes are also **sitting on the market longer**: The median is now **43 days**, up from 35 days last year. * While it depends on location, some states seeing big jumps in inventory include Nevada (+53%), Maryland (+48%), North Carolina (+41%), and California (+37%). **\ud83d\udcc8 Home Prices - Still Climbing Nationally, But Local Drops Exist:** * Despite the inventory build-up, **home prices nationally are NOT going down**. Compared to 12 months ago, they're **up by 1.4%**, and actually hit a record high last month. * **Is the housing market crashing? No.** In the last crash, prices went down by 29% nationally; currently, they're up. * **Local differences are key:** While national prices are up, prices are **falling in 35% of the country**. For example, Austin is down 4.9%, Miami 4.7%, and Chicago 4.4% year-over-year. However, even with these drops, homes remain unaffordable for many. * **What about 2025 & 2026?** Institutions are predicting continued price increases: * **2025 Predictions:** Fannie Mae (+4.1%), Mortgage Bankers Association (+1.3%), National Association of Realtors (+3%). * **2026 Predictions:** Fannie Mae (+2%), MBA (+0.3% - basically flat), NAR (+4%). * So, if you're waiting for a crash, you might be disappointed for another year. **\ud83d\udcca Mortgage Interest Rates - A Potential Cut on the Horizon?** * The average **30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently at 6.6%** and has been trending downward. * The Federal Reserve has a meeting on September 17th. Market expectations, according to the CME Fed Watch Tool, show a **92.5% chance of a 0.25% interest rate cut** in September. This is despite recent \"hot\" producer price index data that shifted the odds slightly. * While the Fed has influence over the 10-year yield (to which mortgage rates are correlated), they may not care about market expectations and might wait for more data. * **Don't expect 3% rates again** unless there's an emergency situation that forces the Fed to intervene drastically. * **Think about this:** If rates *do* go down significantly, it would likely **drive up demand and push home prices even higher**, or at least strongly support them. There's no easy fix for home unaffordability. **\ud83d\udd2e Other Factors Influencing Rates & Future Unpredictability:** * **Bond Market Weakness:** If the bond market performs poorly, and interest rates on 10-year notes increase, mortgage rates could also go up. There's a possibility mortgage rates don't go down, or even increase, in 2026. * **Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac:** The US government is exploring plans to release these entities from government control (i.e., IPO them). If they go private, the loss of government backing could **trigger higher mortgage interest rates, potentially by 1%**. A hybrid model is being proposed to minimize consequences. * **Overall outlook:** With so many variables (Fed actions, bond market, government policy on Fannie/Freddie), the housing market, especially looking into 2026, is described as **\"unpredictable\"**. In summary: No crash, homes still unaffordable, inventory up but prices are holding nationally, and mortgage rates are a bit of a wildcard with potential Fed cuts and other market forces at play.",

This means apartments which are already giving rent specials now compete with home rentals which is something not many people are talking about. If a homeowner decides renting out their place is net cash flow negative then they will put up the house for sale. The one wild card is baby boomers who are now turning 79 this year. Will they sell their expensive West Coast and Northeast homes to move to a cheaper location/nursing home? Will they rent out rooms in their house to pay for retirement/healthcare costs? Or will they move in with their children?",

They're making massive bets on both Broadcom and Intel to outperform. Notably Intel has been going through some tough times lately, it's currently down over 50% from 5 years ago. Their other holdings include energy stocks and other various AI infrastructure companies. This filing comes just a few days after the fund made headlines in the WSJ and [other media outlets](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/ai-focused-hedge-funds-amass-billions-from-investors-wsj/ar-AA1KfzHC), reporting that they had over $1.5b in AUM, and had a return of 47% so far this year.

In retrospect, his reasoning makes perfect sense.

If he\u2019s right, and we\u2019re getting AGI soon, Zuckerberg\u2019s eight-figure compensation packages will be chump change compared to what Leopold\u2019s going to make.

This is where the reporter shows how Capitalism had infiltrated everywhere. The idea that something that is life-saving can be deemed worthless if it can't make you rich. The whole point of economic systems is distribution of resources. Making people rich is just an incentive. If something is required, i.e. life saving medicine, is needed, then the government would just make it available for its population.

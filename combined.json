It feels really good to be back on team red as my very first computer I ever built was a AMD Athlon Axia 1.33Ghz on a Socket A Abit-KT7A waaaaay back in spring of 2001. At that time I went all out and got the first of its kind, VisionTek GeForce 3 for it. Flash forward to 2004 and Values STEAM and Half Life 2 had launched and benchmarks on the web showed that ATIs GPUs ran it much better then the shitty GeForce FX series which also ran hot and loud. So I ditched my geforce got my first ATi Hercules 9800 Pro AGP, it was quite a change back then, but not as much as going from 20 years of geforce usage to AMD with thid beautiful powercolor 9070 XT! It's really nice having the CPU/motherboard/gpu driver and software all together. Adrenaline is super easy to use vs that horrid geforce experience crap and the old nvidia control panel is just so out of date. Going from my i7 9700k to this 9800xd is a amazing difference, I cannot believe how much my 9700k was holding back this 9070xt in games! Cyberpunk went up nearly 50fps! I don't think I'll ever use anything else other AMD products. Feels good to be back in RED camp after all this time!",

This NYTimes \"news\" article is an indirect form of lobbying, disguised as journalism, intended to pressure the Federal Reserve into lowering interest rates via sympathy and emotional manipulation. Whenever these articles pop up, notice how there's never any mention of home prices being lowered. It's always about interest rates. Unless homesellers substantially lower their listing price, they'll be trapped forever in these starter homes, paying rising carrying costs, because nobody wants to become the next bagholder. **Pandemic-Era Homebuyers Feeling Trapped** * Many Americans bought homes during the pandemic when mortgage rates fell below 3%, a historic low. * Now, with rates much higher, homeowners feel locked into their current properties because selling would mean taking on a far more expensive mortgage. **Life Changes vs. Housing Constraints** * Families who bought \u201cstarter homes\u201d during the pandemic are now outgrowing them due to children, pets, or lifestyle changes. * Despite wanting more space, they hesitate to move because their low-rate mortgages are too valuable to give up. **Surveys & Data** * A 2023 survey found 82% of homeowners felt \u201clocked in\u201d by their low mortgage rate. * Nearly 1 in 4 homeowners regret their purchase, especially millennials who underestimated ownership costs or postponed other life goals. **Examples of Trade-Offs** * Some families stay put and consider costly renovations instead of moving. * Others who did move face much higher monthly payments due to today\u2019s interest rates, forcing lifestyle cutbacks. * A few who refinanced after financial struggles now pay significantly more each month. **Broader Market Context** * High rates and limited inventory mean \u201cstarter homes\u201d have become long-term homes for many. * President Trump has floated a 50-year mortgage proposal to ease affordability, but homeowners remain reluctant to give up their existing low-rate loans.",

Even replying to a claim of \"AI has literally never been useful\" by saying \"they've helped me with simple programming tasks\" has gotten me harassed by a bunch of people throwing personal insults, more than once. I mention I once used AI to color a pencil sketch I made by hand, and get told I'm not a \"real artist\". ANY story or news article that has something negative to do with AI gets boosted to the top, even if it's obviously false. The top post on a Reddit updates subreddit right now is, IMO, pretty clearly ragebait (it's about a woman dramatically leaving a man at the altar during their wedding because she found out he used AI, and written very weirdly), but because the guy is being dumped for using AI, the community is eating it up. Maybe it's just me, but I'm starting to feel less and less welcome in any space that isn't specifically pro-AI, which sucks. I genuinely like seeing other viewpoints and having discussions with people about differing views. I don't want to be in just an echo chamber, I'm not gonna be right about everything. But in most online communities these days, it does NOT matter how respectful you are... Just saying something like \"some people do actually find AI to be helpful for specific jobs\" gets me mass downvoted with a lot of pretty nasty insults to boot. It doesn't seem to matter how much I try to see their side; if I say anything that isn't explicitly negative, then it's like I'm the enemy.

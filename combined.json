Minnesota allows for volunteer to include ACTIVISM, some are PAID $ and others VOLUNTEER. This is a big fuck you to President Trump. Their protest riot time counts as volunteer hours to meet the requirements of 20 hours this week, next week, and every week. They log their hours of volunteer or work through NGO and can report that to fulfill the requirements to collect their SNAP, MEDICAID, Housing, Example: Lefty receives $850 in SNAP a month. Needs to work or volunteer 20 hours a week. Goes to a riot protests, video tapes self at the protest, takes pics holding sign, posts on social media sends that to NGO as proof, gets logged for 6 hours when he was there for 2 hours (that is an estimate of the made up volunteer hours, whatever). They can also get paid up to 20 hours to riot protest. The crowds grow bigger as more benefit users realize they can volunteer to meet the requirements. We are getting ripped off...ICE is getting shamed...they are getting their work requirements fulfilled for their SNAP requirements...they figured out how to get one over on Trump's volunteer 20 hour requirements by protesting Trump's ICE Deportations. Let me know if I explained it clearly. The left are using Trump's policy, work/volunteer requirements & taking advantage of MAGA again through another scheme to cause chaos in the streets, violence, all while getting benefits fulfilled at the same time. The protests will be endless because this is what the left is choosing to do for \"work/volunteer\". There's no end in sight if this is allowed to continue.",

We've always known that the Forza Horizon games are very well optimized and are able to run on IGPUs just fine. Keep in mind that Forza Horizon 5 runs just fine on the Vega 3 IGPU in the 7 year old AMD Athlon 3000G. The article is presenting the trivial fact that the B390 is listed as the minimum spec for the upcoming Forza Horizon 6 as somehow being a huge win for Intel. That's not very good journalism.

        "text_content": "From their Discord server: EDITED in the statement sry bout that Adhoc\u2019s statement on Switch censorship emoji:Phenomaman: News **Okay let\u2019s talk Switch release.** We've been quiet for the last few days not because we don't want to address this stuff, but because we've been trying to make sure we're being good partners with Nintendo. They\u2019ve made their own statement regarding this issue: \u201c*Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don\u2019t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations.*\u201d As Nintendo states, any game that\u2019s going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to \u2018*meet \\[Nintendo\u2019s\\] established content and platform guidelines.*\u2019 This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn\u2019t meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That\u2019s what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we\u2019re the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms. We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same. During the porting process it became clear that was not the case. So we asked that we include a disclaimer on the store page to inform customers that content would be different than on other platforms. We worked with Nintendo to get storefront language approved. Where we absolutely need to take full ownership is the placement of that disclaimer. Again, it was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored. While we didn't have complete control of the language, we did have control of the placement. Wires got crossed and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled \"Disclaimer\", instead of the \"About The Game\" section. We didn't catch this until after the launch when we saw people saying we should have called out the changes on the store page, and we went to go make sure it was there. It technically has been the entire time, just in the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it. This is 100% our mistake and it was fixed in the Americas store pages a few hours after launch to give more visibility. We\u2019ve also added a disclaimer before purchase. As of writing this, the other regions have either published this change or are in the process of review. **So what now?** We\u2019re already working with Nintendo on a path forward. While we can\u2019t make any specific promises just yet, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content. I'll get ahead of it now and say that between dev time and the console submission process, we're talking weeks not days. To our fans who were looking forward to playing the uncensored version on Switch, we\u2019re truly sorry. People have a right to be pissed. Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us.

If they both wanted to release the game uncensored, they should have communicated the intention before the game came out on the platforms. Switch/Switch 2 owners if you have Dispatch please refund it AND people DON'T BUY Dispatch on the Switch/Switch 2 until they fix the censorship issue. Keep fighting the good fight!

While we inform partners when their titles don\u2019t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations. Just my two cents: Regardless if Nintendo was responsible or not, what's the excuse to not inform consumers about the censored product they were blindly pre ordering? Why it took until the review embargo to be lifted, for the information to come out... one day before the release? Because by the looks of it, the studio didn't want people to know and made the refund process way more difficult.",

The whole thing is just confusing and the statement they provided, when asked about this, was to make a vague statement that seemed to place blame with Nintendo. The game is going to get an update and they'll have a massive sale. While I wasn't going to get the game, a lot of people preordered it and were excited to play, only to call Nintendo for a refund.

He told investors he could \"copy and modify\" Google\u2019s technology to build a supercomputer on par with international standards. * **Historical Significance:** This marks the first-ever conviction on **AI-related economic espionage** charges. * **The Consequences:** Ding faces up to 10 years in prison for each count of trade secret theft and 15 years for each count of economic espionage. His next court appearance is scheduled for February 3, 2026.",

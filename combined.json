Call it what you like, it must be stopped. Rita Loncharich was reading a magazine at the bookstore in Palm Beach Gardens when she was stabbed in the back without warning by Antonio Moore, 40, who came to Florida just days earlier, according to an affidavit that said he confessed. The store\u2019s surveillance cameras caught Moore running off to nearby woods, where he was quickly arrested, police said. Moore \u201cwillfully admitted to stabbing a woman in the back inside Barnes and Noble and running out of the store,\u201d the affidavit said \u2014 saying he had \u201cno prior interaction\u201d with or motive to kill her. He instead blamed a psychotic \u201cinternal build up\u201d that made him pick on \u201cthe closest person in the store,\u201d investigators said in the affidavit. Prosecutors say, Moore will likely be found \"incapable of understanding a trial\", and ultimately will be found 'too simple' to be found guilty. He'll be sent to a mental health facility, where he'll continue to play the psychotic role for a few months, then miraculously get better, and be released back into the community within a few years. https://t.co/x47L4E8jlV",

I've been loosely been aware of HW from the likes from Groq and Cerebras on their solutions for high speed and low latency inferencing so if even Nvidia thinks this is an interesting avenue, then I wonder what the future holds for DC AI. Probably nothing much changes with their current roadmap for training, but cloud compute to deploy inferencing for massive concurrency could maybe see a shift, after all, it seems efficiency is of importance until power gen infrastructure catches up to demand. I wonder what AMD and Intel are currently thinking. I mean, if they want to give [Cerebras ](https://www.cerebras.ai/blog/cerebras-cs-3-vs-groq-lpu)a call... Also both companies are sitting on their own ASIC/NPU IPs, I wonder what's up with that if they want to scale it up for DC.",

        "text_content": "Really loving AC: Shadows (and Outlaws) and everything else, but following the recent interview from Ubisoft about the game on Switch 2, I wonder if we\u2019ve already hit the limit for overall fidelity and graphics? Shadows has \\*a lot\\* going on with some very detailed environments, generous NPC visibility, super complex game physics/geometrics - and it\u2019s totally open world. In the recent interview, they explained that they pushed things pretty far while pairing bits and pieces back to allow the game to run without removing key features and gameplay. Because of that, the resolution isn\u2019t native and the gap between handheld and docked is quite obvious. They noted we shouldn\u2019t expect that to change as a result. Do we think this is the limit of the Switch 2, and we will need to wait for DLSS improvements to keep new multi-platform games coming to the console in a like-for-like manner - or is there more juice in the tank?",

Protonophores that exclusively produce mild uncoupling can circumvent toxicity concerns, but these compounds or a framework to guide their design is currently lacking. In this study, we prepared a series of atypical arylamide-substituted fatty acid protonophores and found that specific aromatic substitution patterns can fine-tune their uncoupling activity. Notably, 3,4-disubstituted arylamides were found to increase cellular respiration and partially depolarise mitochondria without compromising ATP production or cell viability. These are hallmarks of mild uncoupling. In contrast, 3,5-disubstituted arylamides mimicked the full uncoupling effects of the classical uncouplers DNP and CCCP. Mechanistic studies revealed a diminished capacity for the 3,4-disubstituted arylamides to self-assemble into membrane permeable dimers in the rate limiting step of the protonophoric cycle. This translated into overall slower rates of transmembrane proton transport, and may account for their mild uncoupling activity. This work represents the first exploration of how proton transport rates influence mitochondrial uncoupling and provides a new conceptual framework for the rational design of mild uncouplers..\"",

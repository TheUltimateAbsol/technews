What's more, I paid just over \u00a340 for the keycard and it's \u00a350 on the eShop (and no doubt will be on sale later this month), but the full price on Playstation or Xbox is... *\u00a3105*!!! Now, to be fair, you can get it cheaper on those systems too by shopping around physically and it's already been on sale multiple times for far less digitally, but that was the initial value attributed to the whole package by Ubisoft. I had been planning on waiting for the inevitable digital sale, but \u00a340 for the keycard already seemed a fair enough price, and after realising quite how much you get with this, it's actually pretty incredible value. Fun game too. Yeah, it's got its share of Ubisoft jank, but if you can look past that, there's a lot to enjoy. Glad to see it getting a second lease of life on Switch 2.",

The latest consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released on Sept. 11 shows that in August the shelter index, which includes rent, continued to outpace annual inflation. But housing price growth is slowing down. Over the 12-month period ending in August, rent alone was up 3.5%, according to the BLS. That\u2019s just below the overall 12-month increase for shelter (3.6%). It\u2019s worth noting that rent increases in the CPI look different from data reported by rental websites like Zillow because there\u2019s a lag in how rent data is reflected in the CPI. That means it takes longer for rental shifts in the market to show up in the report. Zillow calculates changes in asking rents using its Zillow Observed Rent Index, which is based on its rental database. Properties are weighted so that the index reflects the rental market as a whole. The lag is primarily due to the cycle of renewals for leases. Since most leases last around a year, a renter\u2019s costs will stay the same all year long. It\u2019s only when the lease ends that a better understanding of the rental market emerges. As of August, rent growth was unusually slow compared to a year earlier, according to Zillow\u2019s latest rental market report. Typical asking rent was $2,007 in August, unchanged from July but up 2.4% year over year. The pace has slowed sharply from the major spikes of 2022, and growth now sits slightly below pre-pandemic averages. Still, rents are 36.2% higher than before the pandemic. The slowdown stems from a mix of more homes available for rent and a cooling housing market \u2014 conditions that give renters a bit more leverage. Affordability remains stretched: The typical household spends 28.9% of income on rent, meaning an annual income of $80,291 is needed to afford the median rental. Rental concessions hit a record: About 36.7% of August listings on Zillow offered concessions \u2014 discounts like free months of rent \u2014 up from last year in 38 of the 50 largest metros. The biggest increases were in Denver, Memphis, Orlando, Houston and Austin. Where is rent most affordable \u2014 and unaffordable? For August, rents fell month over month in 20 metros, including Austin (-0.9%), Providence (-0.5%), Denver (-0.4%), San Antonio (-0.4%), and Boston (-0.4%). Rents rose in 46 of the 50 largest metros, led by Chicago (6.1%), San Francisco (5.1%), New York (5%), Providence (4.6%), and Kansas City (4.6%).",

This engine is designed to bridge the embodiment gap by using an interaction mesh that explicitly preserves critical spatial and contact relationships between the robot, terrain, and objects. By doing this, OmniRetarget transforms human motion capture data into kinematically feasible trajectories, generating over 9 hours of high-qualitydata that allows proprioceptive Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies to be trained efficiently. This high-quality data enabled a Unitree G1 humanoid to successfully execute a complex, long-horizon dynamic sequence: carrying a chair, using it as a step to climb onto a platform, leaping off, and finishing with a parkour-style roll. This entire 30-second sequence is drivenby a proprioceptive-only policy (no vision or LIDAR) trained with just 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization\u2014demonstrating significant progress in agile, human-like robot movement and complex scene interaction.

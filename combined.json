Full English translation of the expert's dialogue: \"Yes, they died out. Now you get it! What we can read from the DNA of old teeth and bones... The first people in Greenland died out because of inbreeding. This little guy has shown us that. We Danes have survived because we mixed with other peoples from the Middle East to West Asia. And this made us more resistant to diseases. So if we don't mix with strangers, we die out. So if you want to give your future children the best possibilities, you should probably choose something a little more exotic.\" (Based on video subtitles and verified sources.) -grok",

This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of a Persian prince on a quest to break a curse. From a third-person perspective, players traverse platform environments, sole puzzles, avoid traps (e.g., spike pits, wall-mounted blades and saws), and battle cursed soldiers and creatures made of sand. Players use swords and daggers to defeat enemies in melee-style combat. Battles are accompanied by sword clashing, cries of pain, blood-splatter and slow-motion effects. A 2D side-scrolling sequence (i.e., the original version of Prince of Persia) depicts blood pools when the prince is killed. During the course of the game, a female character's buttocks is briefly exposed; she and the prince are shown kissing and caressing each other in bed (implying sex), though camera angles obscure breasts and genitalia, as the camera fades to black. This also seems to confirm that the remake will include the original Prince of Persia game. Is Ubisoft about to announce a Ubisoft Forward soon? Feels like between this and the recent updates to the domains for POP/AC Black Flag, something is cooking.",

Looking through the statistical issues, inflation likely remains as expected, keeping the Fed on hold for the foreseeable future. Inflation was slightly lower than expected in December in today\u2019s CPI report. The numbers are still skewed by the government shutdown, but underlying inflation is unlikely to be a major cause for concern. - After stripping out the volatile food and energy categories that Fed officials care less about, core prices increased 0.24% from a month ago and 2.6% from a year ago in December. Forecasters had expected 0.36% and 2.8%. - After the government shutdown ended, the November CPI report was distorted by a number of factors that caused the reported numbers to be too low. Many of those issues resolved themselves with today\u2019s report. But one remaining issue is that shelter inflation\u2013that is, rent inflation\u2013is still too low. - Rent, over 40% of core CPI, is sampled in six groups, with only one surveyed monthly. For the group due for fresh data in October, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) assumed zero inflation. This assumption is likely too low, as rental CPI inflation hasn\u2019t been zero since the financial crisis. This zero-inflation assumption will persist for this group until next April, artificially suppressing inflation until then. - Looking through the statistical issues, the \u201cexcess\u201d inflation above where the Fed would like inflation to be is almost all in goods inflation rather than services. This inflation is primarily driven by tariffs, which means that it will come down later in 2026 once the higher price levels have been fully baked in. That also implies that underlying inflation, apart from tariff effects, is largely fine so there is little need to worry about the Fed hiking rates. The Fed will remain on hold and mortgage rates are unlikely to budge much for the foreseeable future. - The Fed is much more focused on labor market data and any signs of increasing recession risk that would warrant faster rate cuts. - Much of the attention right now in financial markets is on Fed independence given the news of a criminal investigation into Chairman Powell.",

Trying to accomplish much simpler things like a virtual mouse. This is maybe the only time when competition within a company makes sense; when the work to be done is impossible to define. Through the past decade of competition and cooperation, *actual freakin' research*, there would have been institutional knowledge about AI within Facebook.

The data is pulled using the same Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5 16 model which can be configured with either Intel or AMD CPUs for a fairer comparison. > > The main drawbacks to the faster performance of the Intel is that power consumption is slightly higher and it lacks an integrated NPU. When running Prime95, for example, the Intel model would draw 68 W or almost 50 percent more than on the AMD model running the same test. Thus, performance-per-watt isn't necessarily higher even if raw performance is noticeably greater. Fortunately, battery life is still quite long at over 11 hours of web browsing despite the higher power demands when running demanding loads. > > Users who can exploit the integrated NPU on the Ryzen AI 5 330 may also prefer it over the Core 5 210H.

When Horii asked what she meant by \u201cbuzz,\u201d former Shonen Jump Kazuhiko Torishima (another regular member of the talk show) cited a few recent Chrono Trigger-related projects, such as character popularity polls and orchestral concerts planned for 2026. After Horii acknowledged that the concerts would take place next year, he was then asked by Torishima if there were going to be any developments in the franchise after the celebrations. > To this, Horii replied with \u201cI can\u2019t talk about that,\u201d before immediately becoming flustered, jokingly adding comments like, \u201cWait, if I say that, you\u2019ll figure it out!,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t ask!,\u201d Asking is off-limits!,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll get in trouble!\u201d. The whole panel then burst out in laughter and moved on with the show.

The last time account saw major activity was during the 25th anniversary and when the Sakura Wars cast joined Super Robot Wars series. Since September 27th, the account saw major rise in activity. On 27th they officially posted the 29th anniversary tweet (xcancel tweet: https://xcancel.com/Sakura_Taisen/status/1971681184762810673) and have since then regularly posting Happy Birthday tweets for Sakura Wars characters (examples: xcancel links: https://xcancel.com/Sakura_Taisen/status/1980378496569675915, https://xcancel.com/Sakura_Taisen/status/1974942677608141112, https://xcancel.com/Sakura_Taisen/status/1987988634872545678, and more on the official account). They haven't been doing anything like that previously by the way. I think Sega is getting ready to announce the new game soon (and I personally hope HD remasters of original games. If anyone is interested in checking out the series, original Sakura Wars has been fan translated for the Sega Saturn years ago and the sequel got fan translated this year - also for the Sega Saturn).",

                "raw_content": "***From Business Insider's James Rodriguez:*** While the average American submits to a financial colonoscopy en route to their dream home, wannabe real estate moguls have found a way to sidestep the hassle. With the help of a once-obscure type of loan, they've built mini-empires ranging from a few homes to a few hundred \u2014 without the usual scrutiny from lenders. These landlords include small-time investors eager to expand their portfolios, TikTok tycoons seeking new streams of real estate revenue, and seasoned property managers looking to make smart bets. In recent years, they've taken out billions of dollars' worth of \"debt-service coverage ratio\" loans \u2014 often abbreviated as DSCR \u2014 to hoover up homes. The loans enable income-seeking owners to quickly purchase rental properties while dodging annoying questions about their job history or outstanding debts. DSCRs may sound complicated, but obtaining one is relatively straightforward: A landlord just has to show their lender that the desired property will generate enough rent to cover the monthly payments and other basic expenses, such as taxes and insurance. The lender focuses on the property's cash flow, not the borrower's personal creditworthiness. For some of these landlords, the cash isn't flowing as planned. Serious delinquencies on DSCR loans have nearly quadrupled in the past three years, data from the real estate analytics firm Cotality shows. Although the troubled loans account for only a small fraction of the total dollar amount of outstanding DSCR loans, they're a sign that debt-laden landlords face shakier economics amid a rental market slowdown. And while people in the industry defend the idea behind the loans \u2014 \"It's still a great product,\" one lending veteran tells Business Insider \u2014 they acknowledge the spread of some sketchy practices that contributed to the spike in bad debt, including ambitious rent targets, hasty approvals, and loans for properties where the rental income wouldn't even cover the basic monthly payments.

You may have gotten a DSCR mortgage on a rental property in 2021 for 3.9%, but now that loan has to be refinanced in 2026 for 7%+. I'm currently in that exact situation on 3 buildings I have DSCRs on, and upon refinancing they will go from being good cash flowing investments to money sinks. Luckily, I planned for this and have them going to market shortly. If I can sell them at current market rate, I got out free and clear. If I can't sell them, then I will have to refinance and then the Trainwreck begins.",

                "raw_content": "House prices continued to rise in the third quarter of 2025, though the pace of growth slowed as elevated mortgage rates, affordability challenges, and persistent economic uncertainty weighed on consumer demand. After several years of rapid growth, Hawaii and 38 metro areas saw house price declines this quarter, highlighting significant regional variations in market conditions. Nationally, according to the quarterly all-transactions House Price Index (HPI) released by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), U.S. house prices rose 3.3% in the third quarter of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This represents the slowest year-over-year price appreciation since 2013, indicating a cooling in the housing market following a decade of robust price growth. The FHFA\u2019s all-transactions HPI tracks average price changes based on repeat sales and refinancings of the same single-family properties. It offers insights not only at the national level but also across states and metropolitan areas. Between the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2025, 48 states and the District of Columbia experienced positive year-over-year (YoY) house price appreciation, with gains ranging from 0.6% to 6.8%. Hawaii was the only state to record a decline, while Florida posted no growth. New York led all states with a 6.8% gain, followed by Connecticut with a 6.5% gain and Illinois with a 6.2% gain. On the opposite end, Colorado posted the lowest house price appreciation at 0.6%. Notably, out of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, 29 states exceeded the national YoY growth rate of 3.3%. However, on a quarterly basis, home price appreciation decelerated in 45 states compared to the second quarter of 2025, highlighting a broad-based deceleration in the housing market. House price growth also varied widely across U.S. metro areas, ranging from a 7.8% decline to a 16.0% increase year-over-year. Punta Gorda, FL recorded the steepest drop, while Farmington, NM posted the strongest gains over the previous four quarters. In the third quarter of 2025, 34 metro areas, in reddish color on the map above, experienced negative house price growth, while 351 metro areas posted increases. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, house prices have surged nationally. Between the first quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2025, house prices climbed 54.9% nationwide, with more than half of metro areas exceeding this rate. However, 226 metro areas have seen varying degrees of decline from their post-COVID peaks, ranging from -0.1% to -12.7%. The map below presents the top ten and bottom ten markets for house price appreciation over the past five years. Among all the metro areas, house price appreciation ranged from 18.3% to 88.4%. Knoxville, TN topped the list with the highest house price appreciation, while Odessa, TX posted the lowest appreciation, ending Lake Charles, LA\u2019s five-quarter run at the bottom. https://eyeonhousing.org/2025/12/house-price-appreciation-by-state-and-metro-area-third-quarter-2025/",

Many are convinced they\u2019ll be able to find a home they like better because there are so many listings on the market. * Homebuyers are most likely to walk away in Texas and Florida, and least likely in Nassau County, NY and the Bay Area. Roughly 53,000 U.S. home-purchase agreements were canceled in October, equal to 15.1% of homes that went under contract that month. That\u2019s up from 14.3% a year earlier. This is based on a Redfin analysis of MLS pending-sales data. The data is seasonal, which is why we compare this October to past Octobers. Please note that homes that fell out of contract during a given month didn\u2019t necessarily go under contract the same month. For example, a home that fell out of contract in October could have gone under contract in September. Home-purchase cancellations remain elevated for several reasons. High housing costs and economic uncertainty are giving some buyers cold feet. It\u2019s also a buyer\u2019s market, with home sellers significantly outnumbering homebuyers. This means buyers in most areas have room to negotiate and the flexibility to take their time; if they decide against one home, they will likely be able to find another one that meets their needs. \u201cBuyers know they have options, so if a seller isn\u2019t willing to address a maintenance issue, the buyer will walk away,\u201d said Tracy Edwards, a Redfin Premier real estate agent in Winston-Salem, NC. \u201cA lot of sellers are having to adjust their expectations\u2014some still think their home is worth more than the market will bear.\u201d Redfin agents recommend that sellers price reasonably from the get-go to limit the chances of their home sitting on the market and buyers getting cold feet. San Antonio Has the Highest Rate of Home-Purchase Cancellations San Antonio leads the nation in canceled deals, with over one in five (21%) pending home sales falling through in October. It\u2019s followed by Fort Lauderdale, FL (20%), Fort Worth, TX (19.7%), Las Vegas (19.2%) and Jacksonville, FL (19.2%). Redfin analyzed the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas and included in this analysis the 47 with sufficient data. Texas and Florida have been building more homes than anywhere else in the country, prompting some buyers to back out of deals because they\u2019re confident they will be able to find a different home that works better for them. Some buyers in the Sunshine State are also getting cold feet due to increasing natural disasters and soaring insurance and HOA fees. The lowest cancellation rate was in Nassau County, NY, where 4.4% of pending home sales fell through in October. Next came San Francisco (4.6%), San Jose, CA (7%), Oakland, CA (9.1%) and Montgomery County, PA (9.2%). Redfin recently reported that the Bay Area\u2019s housing market has been heating up amid an AI boom and a return to the office.",

The contract rate on a 30-year mortgage dropped 8 basis points to 6.32% in the week ended Nov. 28, which included the Thanksgiving holiday, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released Wednesday. The rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage declined to 5.4%, the lowest since May 2023. The group\u2019s gauge of home-purchase applications climbed 2.5% to the highest level since early 2023. While the weekly figures tend to be volatile around holidays, a sustained pickup in purchase activity would point to steady underlying demand for the affordability-challenged housing market. MBA\u2019s measure of refinancing, meantime, fell for a fifth straight week \u2014 the longest stretch of declines in a year. The MBA survey, which has been conducted weekly since 1990, uses responses from mortgage bankers, commercial banks and thrifts. The data cover more than 75% of all retail residential mortgage applications in the US.",

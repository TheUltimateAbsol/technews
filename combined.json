        "text_content": "This was at a Target. So first off it\u2019s a gorgeous game. Clearly it was made for Switch 1 but the Switch 2 just pushes it to the extra level it needs. I toggled on and off the 4K 60fps and the 1080p 120fps modes and its take a couple seconds for it to switch between them and actually flashed to a black screen for a second before switching but it\u2019s pretty seamless. The 4K to 1080p was noticeable but the 60-120 (to me) wasn\u2019t that noticeable. Both modes are very smooth or maybe the tv in the target doesn\u2019t properly show 120? Idk. The new gameplay with more modern controls took awhile to get used to (mostly because I\u2019ve been replaying the old ones in preparation) they designated to X button as the scam visor which actually worked very well. Morph ball on Y, and muddled on RB which I kept mixing those two up for some reason. Dashing feels great in this game because you can essentially do it in any direction and the way the morph ball feels you can basically use it as a duck and it works really well. The boss fight at the end was cool because it takes some pretty precise movements which will be great with the mouse mode which I couldn\u2019t test. Overall very fun demo. Also the music was great! Same music as that initial trailer reveal for the game. I\u2019m even more excited the this game now.",

Nintendo recently stated during their quarterly report that they were intending to [acquire more development teams](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-states-its-intention-to-acquire-more-development-teams). Obviously, they're not taking that route on a whim. This strategy comes out of a necessity to bring players more projects and this is where Tantalus comes into play. Quick look at their [history](https://www.tantalus.com.au/games.html) will show you the only projects in partnership with Nintendo were HD ports. First, they were trusted to pursue the HD remakes as Nintendo EAD was busy developing BotW. While some considered work on TPHD and SSHD to be not as extensive as what was done on TWWHD, they are nonetheless great remasters and broadly considered the definitive editions of these games. All 3D Zelda from GameCube to Wii are now available in glorious 1080p thanks to them. Their most recent partnership with Nintendo was a 3DS game and this here caught my attention because it feels like the port kind of came out of nowhere. But what if this was just the first 3DS port of many to come? I don't have anything to back any of my claims but Tantalus is not only familiar with remaking Zelda games, they've also now tackled 3DS games and I believe Ocarina of Time 3D and Majora's Mask 3D will be next. There's a plethora of games on 3DS that would benefit from being ported (back, I guess) to television. Kid Icarus comes to mind. It just makes sense to me that Tantalus would be the one studio to do it. A week ago, I didn't think this had much credit but then I recently heard about Panic Button being selected by Nintendo to work on Switch 2 Editions and it just feels like the writing is on the wall here.",

In other words, it seems like she is saying that right now only expensive houses are being bought, so the median house sale price is high compared to median salary. Per this analyst, a lot of Lower price houses are going to start getting bought in 2026, which will then lower the median house price.

Dive Brief: - The U.S. Justice Department and RealPage reached an agreement Monday to settle a 2024 lawsuit that claimed the software provider enabled landlords to collude to raise rent prices beyond free market levels. - The settlement, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, is subject to court approval. The agreement includes no financial penalties, damages or findings or admissions of wrongdoing, but puts guardrails around what data Richardson, Texas-based RealPage can collect and how it can use it. - \u201cThis resolution with the DOJ was necessary to provide certainty and finality for RealPage and its customers to avoid protracted litigation,\u201d said Stephen Weissman, Gibson Dunn partner and former deputy director for the Federal Trade Commission, in a Monday press release from RealPage. Dive Insight: According to RealPage, the settlement boosts confidence for the housing industry and demonstrates that its revenue management software can be used in compliance with the views of federal antitrust enforcers. \u201cThis resolution marks an important milestone for RealPage, our customers, and the multifamily industry,\u201d said RealPage President and CEO Dirk Wakeham in the release. \u201cWe are pleased to have reached this agreement with the DOJ, which brings the clarity and stability we have long sought and allows us to move forward with a continued focus on innovation and the shared goal of better outcomes for both housing providers and renters.\u201d Per the DOJ, the proposed settlement would help restore competition in rental markets for millions of renters, according to a Monday press release. \u201cCompeting companies must make independent pricing decisions, and with the rise of algorithmic and artificial intelligence tools, we will remain at the forefront of vigorous antitrust enforcement,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater in the DOJ\u2019s release. Specifically, the agreement would require RealPage to: - Cease having its software use competing rental management companies\u2019 nonpublic, competitively sensitive information to determine rental prices in runtime operation. - Cease using active lease data for purposes of training the models underlying the software, limiting model training to historic or backward-looking nonpublic data aged at least 12 months. - Not use models that determine geographic effects narrower than at a state level. - Remove or redesign features that limited price decreases or aligned pricing between competing users of the software. - Cease conducting market surveys to collect competitively sensitive information. - Refrain from discussing market analyses or trends based on nonpublic data, or pricing strategies, in RealPage meetings relating to revenue management software. - Accept a court-appointed monitor to ensure compliance. Cooperate in the United States\u2019 lawsuit against property management companies that have used its software. Several state attorneys general are also pursuing their own legal actions. Earlier this month, four AGs asked a federal judge to reject nearly $142 million in settlements between renters and major property managers, arguing that the deals could undermine their ongoing cases. On Nov. 20, nine states reached a $7 million settlement with apartment giant Greystar, which used RealPage software.",

ANALYSIS \u201cThe housing market's deceleration accelerated in September, with the National Composite posting just a 1.3% annual gain\u2014the weakest performance since mid-2023,\u201d said Nicholas Godec, CFA, CAIA, CIPM, Head of Fixed Income Tradables & Commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cThis marks a continued slide from August\u2019s 1.4% increase and represents a stark contrast to the double-digit gains that characterized the early post-pandemic era. National home prices continued trailing inflation, with September\u2019s CPI running 1.7 percentage points ahead of housing appreciation. This marks the widest gap between inflation and home-price growth since the two measures diverged in June, with the spread continuing to widen each month. \u201cRegional performance reveals a tale of two markets. Chicago continues to lead with a 5.5% annual gain, followed by New York at 5.2% and Boston at 4.1%. These Northeastern and Midwestern metros have sustained momentum even as broader market conditions soften. At the opposite extreme, Tampa posted a 4.1% annual decline\u2014the sharpest drop among tracked metros and its 11th consecutive month of negative annual returns. Phoenix (-2.0%), Dallas (-1.3%), and Miami (-1.3%) likewise remained in negative territory, highlighting particular weakness in Sun Belt markets that experienced the most dramatic pandemic-era price surges. \u201cThe geographic rotation is striking. Markets that were pandemic darlings\u2014particularly in Florida, Arizona, and Texas\u2014are now experiencing outright price declines. Meanwhile, traditionally stable metros in the Northeast and Midwest continue to post solid gains, suggesting a reversion to prepandemic patterns where job markets and urban fundamentals drive appreciation rather than migration trends and remote-work dynamics. \u201cSeptember\u2019s monthly performance was uniformly weak. All 20 tracked metros posted month-overmonth declines before seasonal adjustment, with Tampa (-1.0%), San Diego (-0.9%), and Seattle (- 0.9%) leading the downturn. Even after seasonal adjustment, the National Index managed only a 0.2% gain. This broad-based monthly weakness suggests that elevated mortgage rates\u2014which remained near 6.3% in late September\u2014are finally overwhelming the market\u2019s supply constraints. \u201cA deeper look at momentum shows clear weakening. Over the past six months, national home prices have risen just 0.4%, a gain that is only marginal in nominal terms and negative in real inflationadjusted terms. The deceleration from early-2025 strength has been broad-based, with only seven of the 20 metros\u2014Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Boston, New York, Charlotte, and Atlanta\u2014posting positive price appreciation over the trailing six-month period. Most Sun Belt and Western markets experienced outright declines, underscoring how affordability pressures and higher mortgage rates have eroded momentum across much of the country. \u201cFor context, this represents the weakest annual price growth since early 2023, when the market was absorbing the initial shock of the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive rate-hiking cycle,\u201d Godec concluded. \u201cYet unlike that period, which saw a quick rebound, current conditions suggest more persistent headwinds. With mortgage rates stubbornly elevated and affordability at multi-decade lows, the market appears to be settling into a new equilibrium of minimal price growth\u2014or, in some regions, outright decline.\u201d YEAR-OVER-YEAR The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 1.3% annual gain for September, down from a 1.4% rise in the previous month. The 10-City Composite showed an annual increase of 2.0%, down from a 2.1% increase in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a year-over-year increase of 1.4%, down from a 1.6% increase in the previous month. Chicago reported the highest annual gain among the 20 cities with a 5.5% increase in September, followed by New York and Boston with annual increases of 5.2% and 4.1%, respectively. Tampa posted the lowest return in September, falling 4.1%. The chart below compares year-over-year returns for different housing price ranges (tiers) in Chicago. MONTH-OVER-MONTH The pre-seasonally adjusted U.S. National, 10-City Composite, and 20-City Composite Indices continued to report negative month-over-month changes in September, posting -0.3% for the U.S. National Index and -0.5% for both the 10-City and 20-City Composite Indices. After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National and 10-City Composite Indices reported a monthly increase of 0.2% and the 20-City Composite Indices posted a month-over-month gain of 0.1%.

It makes more financial sense, and more sense in general, to keep bouncing around to the free tiers of AI service providers. That way, you keep on top of what the competing AIs are doing as well as saving money.",

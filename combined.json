Reconfirming what we know, Granite Ridge CCDs are different to the ones found in Strix Halo requiring a new tape-out. 4% in die space savings when moving from SERDES GMI-narrow links to RDL fan-out interconnect (using TSMC InFO-oS). This may be one of the reasons why we see lower than expected volume for STX-H and it's high price tag (not to mention it's large IOD is \\~307mm2). The benefits of the new 'sea-of-wires' is lower power for data transfer, so lower voltages for freq, which is what you'd find sipping power on current desktop Ryzens on the IOD (also memory) and lower latency and higher bandwidth. [u/high\\_yield\\_yt](https://www.reddit.com/user/high_yield_yt/) used Aida's $/mem benchmark, which I've barely come across so it's finally nice to see some numbers and as you can see bandwidth is orders of magnitude higher. Though, while we wait for C&C, wished he used Clamchowder's [Microbenhcmark suite](https://github.com/clamchowder/Microbenchmarks) as it is superior to Aida's. Also, would've loved to see C2C latency test, IIRC Aida has one(?) but there are tools like [https://github.com/nviennot/core-to-core-latency](https://github.com/nviennot/core-to-core-latency) that you can easily run.",

The CCDs would maintain full speed and coherence becomes much easier to manage, only question is if the distance is not to large to the IOD to offset some of the 3DVCaches performance. Also would raise questions for servers as the IOD might have different constraints or be to small to carry so much cache...",

Beyond the well-known cases of Wachovia and HSBC, are there any major investigative reports, long-form journalism pieces, or reliable communities/forums where I can gather insights?

Santa Fe has some of the highest housing prices in the nation and the overall salary to housing costs here are drastic. https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs40/40393/40393p.pdf But 2008 did wreck NM, just not housing costs. NM is one of the only states that never recovered lost jobs from the crash and there are more people on SNAP in 2018 than before 2008. Lots and lots of single family housing and very little apartment dwellings. While Albuquerque did see housing price declines after a peak in the third quarter of 2007, the drops were not as sharp as in the cities that had the most inflated housing markets. For example, in the first quarter of 2008, the median sales price in Santa Fe fell 15% in the city and 7% in the county. Santa Fe is the only place in the state that would have a legit crash and even with high prices, it didn\u2019t crash like other cities with similar wage to housing price disparities. New Mexico is incredibly poor and there is no reason the housing prices should be so high now or why the market is so stable. The state has had an exodus for decades of the middle class leaving.",

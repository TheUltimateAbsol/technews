        "score": 249,
        "text_content": "<p>I suspect many young people (basically, anyone who has never been paying on a mortgage for a good stretch of time) do not understand why a longterm mortgage is not that burdensome. It was harder for people in their early-to-mid 20s to buy a mortgage during the disruption of the Covid scamdemic and the tepid return to quasi-normal.</p> <p>A policy that lowers the monthly mortgage rate through a 50-year term makes it possible for more first-time buyers to finance a house.</p> <p>But the vociferous complaints about the possibility of a 50-year mortgage term by the left (and faux-MAGA &quot;influencers&quot;) are resonating among people in their late 20s because many in this generation they have spent half a decade without being able to finance a mortgage (hard to do that with an uncertain economy during the covid scamdemic and tepid economic recovery thereafter).</p> <p>This generation has seen credit card debts appreciating faster than they can be paid off. So it would be natural - but incorrect - if they were to assume that a 50-year mortgage term means debt slavery.</p> <p>It's all about getting that first house through financing, and staying in it long enough to have far more options than people who have never bought a house. Basically, if a person has gotten to the point of being able to make monthly payments on a longterm mortgage, the burden is less and less as time goes on.</p> <p>Here is how it works:</p> <ol> <li> <p>There is a tax deduction on interest for a primary residence;</p> </li> <li> <p>Inflation / cost of living continue to rise over the years but fixed-rate mortgage payments do not;</p> </li> <li> <p>After a decent period of time with a mortgage - e.g., 20 years - the mortgage payments look ridiculously small compared to the cost of renting a house or an apartment in a safe and well-run apartment complex;</p> </li> <li> <p>It becomes easier and easier to pay off the mortgage as incomes adjust to inflation but the mortgage remains the same or even decreases (if it is a combination of a shorter-term and comparatively longer term loans, when the shorter term mortgage is paid off, there is a sudden drop in what is owed each month);</p> </li> <li> <p>Many people will sell a primary residence before the mortgage is paid off, in order to enter into a new mortgage agreement for a new primary residence. As long as the money is rolled from the sale of the 1st house into the new house, there is no federal income tax for the sale. A lot of people will buy a lower-end first house, wait 15 - 20 years, and roll it over into a new house. The appreciation in value of the first house means the person can have a higher percentage of equity (=value of house in excess of loan debt) in the new house than he had when he originally purchased the first house.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Provided that you do not buy a house in a decaying neighborhood of a state that is suffering from a mass exodus of citizens (think of all the abandoned shacks in Detroit), here is what this all means:</p> <p>Once you can stomach the monthly payment of a 50-year loan, you can spend some years in the house and get to the point where it is easier and easier to pay down the mortgage much faster (e.g., pay off in 25 years, not 50) or roll the proceeds of selling it at a much higher price (e.g., 15 years later) into a new house with a shorter mortgage term (20/30 year mortgage).</p> <p>The big barrier to entry is to save up enough to get to the point of buying the first primary residence. If a 50-year mortgage makes that easier, it means that more younger citizens will escape the trap of paying rent on a house or apartment. And more younger citizens will enjoy the benefits of an appreciating asset with monthly loan payments that become smaller and smaller (compared to the economy/cost of living) as time goes on.</p> <p>Everyone on PDW who has had a mortgage for a good stint understands these things.</p> <p>As I write this post, it occurs to me that the left's goal is not only to bring about historical amnesia (as in Orwell's 1984, when people do not know history it is harder to challenge Big Brother's narrative), but also to make it so that people are unaware of basic strategies for life that everyone used to know.</p> <p>A 5-year disruption to our economy was enough to create a huge number of people in their late 20s who have never had the experience of buying (and staying in) a primary residence through financing. And if enough people are unaware of how it really works with a mortgage, they may fear and oppose the idea of spreading out a loan over a longer term to enable a first-time buyer to stop renting a place he can never own.</p>",

Santa Clara\u2019s grid is an antique orchestra trying to accompany a stadium full of subwoofers, and the dissonance tells you something deeper about the moment we are living in. A hundred megawatts of empty data centers in the literal backyard of Nvidia is not a tech story. It is a civics story. It is the same pattern we keep seeing across the West: political elites promise a frictionless, electrified future while refusing to build the substations, transmission lines, transformers, or generation that make that future possible. They legislate dreams and budget away the infrastructure. California keeps telling the world it will run AI, EVs, and a green grid simultaneously. Instead of increasing dispatchable power capacity, they constrict it. Instead of streamlining permits, they bury everything under years of regulatory molasses. The result is predictable. The lights stay on only because demand is throttled. Even the mighty Silicon Valley hits the ceiling. This is the same failure mode you see in Europe\u2019s energy crunch, Colorado\u2019s transmission bottlenecks, and New York\u2019s impossible timelines for electrification mandates. No civilization gets to \u201cinnovation\u201d its way out of the need for actual kilowatts. Data centers do not run on vibes. If anything, this story is a warning flare for the entire AI gold rush. Compute demand is exploding, but Western governments are shrinking the very infrastructure that supports it. The people yelling loudest about \u201cthe future\u201d are the same people who refuse to build the pipes that carry the future. A thread like this should explore the real question: can a high-tech society survive when its ruling class treats power generation as optional? The answer is already glowing red on the substation panel.",

IGN immediately started out with a large hit-piece against the game over this single character. Nintendo fans who have defended and up roared for the continuation and support for niche and somewhat hard-to-get-into games have nothing but disgust for Metroid Prime 4 attempting to do anything. I will not name the obvious Youtuber, but I think it's fair to say that if you're a Metroid fan and a fan of other sci-fi games, you'd also feel like me. Very VERY sad. Every internet space is a hellhole making fun of Mackenzie when his presence is not even large, and in fact - a great addition. I didn't see any of the reactions yet, just watched the overview trailer and the 20 minute gameplay segment from \"Press Start Australia,\" and thought \"wow. What a colorful cast. Reminds me of Aliens.\" The game looks like it has so much charm and life into it. From the world, the music, even the cutscene production looks so fantastic. Better than one's I have seen in other AAA games like God of War or Horizon. Yet, this game introduces a comic character, who only has so many lines until you leave, and that is enough for Youtubers to create entire \"crash-outs\" against this game. What about the few Metroid fans? This is already a niche sci-fi series, unlike other Nintendo IPs, yet other Nintendo fans are also ripping this game to shreds without a single thought of \"maybe this isn't for me.\" I find the entire behavior extremely rude and disingenuous. This character absolutely did not cause this much pain. We have already seen the game. It is colorful, big, open, and less \"scarily isolating\" than past entries. No one could possibly think this is surprising. Even during the treehouse footage, there was such a highlight on the Federation troopers with their unique dialogues and voice lines. If you wanted to indulge in the \"isolated experience,\" you are free to play the prior games. Metroid Dread is brilliant and it's right there, with a likely chance of a sequel coming soon. Games like this used to be extremely celebratory. To have Samus be more stoic than ever, escaping a planet to actually save people, rather than killing an entire planet's life, is extremely noble and reminds me of the best of sci-fi gaming, Halo. These stories mean so much to people and it's extremely rare to have these sci-fi stories come out today. Finally, this reminds of Aliens, and while Ripley may not have saved the team, it might be wonderful to see a character like Samus, heroically save the team and potentially save the planet (a different outcome compared to each game before). I am disappointed in all the hit-pieces, and rage baiting journalists / YouTubers. I can't wait to play this game, and I hope Retro Studios, and all the new developers feel proud about themselves for what may be such a fantastic experience and new perspective for the Metroid franchise. The studio has inspired my life so much and I thank them for all their work.

Even replying to a claim of \"AI has literally never been useful\" by saying \"they've helped me with simple programming tasks\" has gotten me harassed by a bunch of people throwing personal insults, more than once. I mention I once used AI to color a pencil sketch I made by hand, and get told I'm not a \"real artist\". ANY story or news article that has something negative to do with AI gets boosted to the top, even if it's obviously false. The top post on a Reddit updates subreddit right now is, IMO, pretty clearly ragebait (it's about a woman dramatically leaving a man at the altar during their wedding because she found out he used AI, and written very weirdly), but because the guy is being dumped for using AI, the community is eating it up. Maybe it's just me, but I'm starting to feel less and less welcome in any space that isn't specifically pro-AI, which sucks. I genuinely like seeing other viewpoints and having discussions with people about differing views. I don't want to be in just an echo chamber, I'm not gonna be right about everything. But in most online communities these days, it does NOT matter how respectful you are... Just saying something like \"some people do actually find AI to be helpful for specific jobs\" gets me mass downvoted with a lot of pretty nasty insults to boot. It doesn't seem to matter how much I try to see their side; if I say anything that isn't explicitly negative, then it's like I'm the enemy.

And I've seen issues from both ends of the spectrum on this issue, without a doubt, but the \"antis\" have taken it to an almost... bigoted level. Yeah sure, sound the alarm when it's necessary but you have to be able to think for a few more seconds about everything before shouting reprehensible shit onto the internet. TL:DR - Idk if a middle ground even exists anymore and I am quite unsettled by that.",

Why? Since it's difficult to debloat an existing workforce, a strategy could be to strip the workforce down to a skeleton crew and then slowly rebuild a more efficient workforce The problem with this strategy is that MANY companies are willing to take on recently laid off Intel employees, and they likely have better stock options, 401k, bonuses and pay compared to Intel. Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm and ARM can also afford to pay much higher prices to attract the best industry talent. If Lip Bu Tan cuts too deep, he risks firing irreplaceable talented and veteran employees who worked there for 20-30 years who are loyal to the company. Pat Gelsinger already made the deeply idiotic decision to cut the Royal Core project, which drove most of them to quit. These people included the chief architect for the Haswell uarch from the now defunct Oregon P-core team. These 80-100 people are now part of a startup called Ahead Computing that is now a designing high-performance RISC-V core. The people in the RYC project were the most talented people from the Haifa Israel P-core team and across Intel, which could've bled the Haifa team dry of any real talent. It could explain why GLC and LNC are so disappointing in PPA and PPW. Now, the Intel Atom team in Austen, Texas, has their most talented CPU engineers. If Lip Bu Tan wants Intel to survive, he CANNOT significantly gut this team since they're designing the new Atom based Unified Core uarch that will replace Intel's bloated and underperforming P-core uarch family. If he cuts too deep, it could completely destroy Intel as a company. TLDR: Lip Bu Tan needs to be very careful with layoffs. Edit: Fun Fact: The Atom team was established in Intel's \"Texas Development Center\" in 2004, it was a MUCH smaller team, had a small budget compared to the P-core team and the chief architect of the Bonnell uarch used in the original Atom was Elinora Yoeli who was also the chief architect of the Pentium-M.",

I don't know about you but I was never able to enjoy Mario Kart 8, I'm really really sorry, I tried to enjoy it for years, but I never liked the controls, and I was unable to enjoy 150cc. The most fun I ever had was with 200c, and even then I'm sure you know how BS that whole mod can be sometimes. And of course, I didn't even bother with online matches, naturally I always got last due to my lack of skill and all of that. HOWEVER With Mario Kart World is different, first, I love the open world, precisely because I just run to my hearts content, if I find a P switch then good! And if I don't then that's good too. And my biggest enjoyment comes from Knockout Tour, holy shit guys, I lose the majority of the time, but when you are in that top 8 racers that's just the best feeling, well, second best. The best feeling of them all is when you actually get into first place!! (I've been able to do it two times now, in real online races of course) So yeah! I just wanted to show some appreciation to the game, I'm really happy to say that I can enjoy this game and this new direction for the series, can't wait for Donkey Kong next week!",

I actually work alongside a PhD Data Scientist from China and he said - back home - the attitude towards progress is completely different. There is no protectionism ( think OpenAI hiding reasoning models for months ) as everyone is working to a common goal. If university A makes a breakthrough, they share it, and collaborate wherever possible to facilitate the national strategy. Edit - Since this sparked a bit of debate, a prime example is Tsinghua University. I asked my Chinese colleague why their research is SO good and he said it's because research is seen as noble and honourable in China. Publishing weak or sensationalist research (even preprint) is seen as very undesirable. Xi jingping went to that University and NOBODY dare be the person to disgrace his reputation in any way.

Its equivalent of USA building 208 nuclear powerplants during Trumps rule. USA currently has 54 nuclear poweplants with 93 reactors, from the beggining of nuclear time. So in 4 years China will more than double whatever USA built since 1945. If they figure out storage in this 4 years, multiply everything by 5, it will be around 1000 times. And its much cheaper, faster to build and more benevolent than anything nuclear, coal or oil/gas b1ased. At one point bullshit exposes itself as clear bullshit. Like in, math doesnt math anymore :)",

                "raw_content": "[I would argue this article actually undersells the actual paper. Shockingly.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60612-9) Against my better judgement, it's hype time. A TLDR of the paper, in plain language, because good lordy it's a dense paper: E. Coli (and Shigella, and lots of bacterium really but these two are named explicitly) need to consume iron in order to survive and reproduce. This is often what limits how fast these bacterium can reproduce in the human body. This iron is often acquired by taking it from your hemoglobin directly! The outside of the bacterium have special tools (ChuA is the one targeted here because it's the most effective/has the highest binding affinity) that can grab hemoglobin, and then extract the heme cofactor (the iron.) Fox et al. (the above paper) used a wide set of tools to understand exactly how *this* hemoglobin-grabber works, and used AlphaFold to...well, design a plug, essentially. This plug - the \"binder\" - does what it says on the tin and binds to the iron-stealing tool on the outside of these bacterium. The binder mimics the shape of ChuA *just right* such that it can plug into ChuA sort of like hemoglobin would. In fact, it binds way better than hemoglobin does, and therefore even in *really* low concentrations, there's gonna be way more of this binder stuffed into ChuA than actual hemoglobin. It's just that attractive to the bacteria's ChuA. This means very little iron enters the bacterium, and then it cannot reproduce. This kills the infection. Among other things, this work demonstrated that these binders were both able to be manufactured, the manufacturing process strongly resembled the output of AlphaFold, the binders were *highly* effective right out of the box (see: directly from AlphaFold, no additional tweaks necessary), and learned a lot about the process of heme piracy (love that term) by E. Coli. **In summary: It just friggin worked.** A broader generalization (this is my interpretation now) is that it suggests that it is now possible to design bespoke antimicrobials (antibiotics) directly targeting cellular processes, as opposed to traditional routes that can take years to yield this same result. To maximize the hype: I'd put five bucks down on methods like this \"solving\" antibiotic resistant bacteria, inasmuch as we can just continue to crank out antibiotics as fast as they can pass the review process. Okay, hype is done. Let's turn the hype down. Funny thing about that review process. It would still take *many* years for something to go from *this* stage, to an actual medication, not to mention billions of dollars in testing, and all things of that nature. The failure rate of clinical trials for new medications is absurdly high. ...buuuut, that doesn't make this any less incredible. How exciting! Generative design is the single most exciting application of AI research that I've seen so far, and this is the greatest so far. (I think I made a good TLDR! Happy to make tweaks if I totally flubbed anything. Thanks for reading :))",

The walk was part of a promotional demo for the upcoming RoboWar event on July 19, hosted by Interactive Combat League. Art Cartwright, the event organizer, emphasized that Zion is \u201charmless\u201d and serves to familiarize the public with robotics and spark youth interest in STEM. Witnesses described the movement as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and likened it to RoboCop. The appearance quickly went viral across social media and local news",

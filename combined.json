Now I'm really hoping that the people who've speculated that a firmware update could add overdrive and resolve it are correct, and that Nintendo actually does it. Not getting my hopes up, though... EDIT: For all the people who say they don't see it, I hope it stays that way! On day 1 I booted up Hollow Knight side by side with my OLED and still it didn't really register. But if you're genuinely interested and want to seek it out in H2, try focusing on the background and edges of the screen rather than on Mel while moving. All the detail smears away. On screens with a good response time like the OLED, that doesn't happen. The Library in Snowdin in Undertale is another good spot if you look at the sign outside. You straight up can't read it while moving. There's a theory that this should be fixable in the firmware, and that Nintendo optimized instead for battery life. But this theoretical firmware fix should only take 1-2% off a charge, which at this point is a price I'd gladly pay.",

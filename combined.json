Even worse is that this is almost iso power too (450 watts for CLF and 500 for sierra forest). > To reduce the number of mesh stops and reduce network traffic, two cores now share a common L2 cache in each DCM, (DMR) Interesting that Zen 6 and DMR both look like they will have \\~32 stops on their mesh for each tile/chiplet. >While this means Diamond Rapids has 256 cores in total, it seems only up to 192 cores will be enabled for the mainline SKUs, with higher core counts presumably reserved for off-roadmap orders due to lower yields. This sounds improbable. Having to disable 25% of the cores on each tile is insane. Surely 18A yields are not that poor.... And even if they were, what are the chances they don't just include it in their main lineup anyway and just price them incredibly high, just so they can show it off? The Sierra Forest 288C model of reserving it for hyperscalers and being non public only seems to have happened because demand for the product was *that* low. >As AMD already enjoys significantly higher performance per core than Intel (96c Turin matches 128c Granite Rapids) Don't think this is the case in general. >the performance gap between AMD Venice and Intel Diamond Rapids will widen even more in the 2026 to 2028 generation of datacenter CPUs Hard to tell IMO. In GNR vs Turin, AMD has a per-core perf advantage, and a 50% core count and node advantage with Turin Dense. For DMR vs Venice, AMD will have a node advantage across the entire lineup, but Intel may be able to close the per-core perf advantage, and AMD \"only\" has a 50% thread count advantage from HT vs the 50% core count advantage before.",

In a year-ahead forecast published Jan. 27, analysts said price growth will stall at 0% in 2026 after nearly doubling over the past decade, with a slight improvement in demand likely neutralizing a supply uptick. Helping buyers is an expected dip in adjustable-rate mortgages as the Federal Reserve continues to lower borrowing costs later this year, even as the 30-year fixed rate stays above 6%. On top of that, homebuilders will keep offering rate buydowns to lower mortgages to clear unsold inventory. \u201cWe think this could be enough, along with a rising wealth effect, to shift demand higher while supply increases subside,\u201d John Sim, head of securitized products research at JPMorgan, said in the note.

                "raw_content": "Mortgage application activity rose sharply in January, driven primarily by a surge in refinancing activity as mortgage rates declined to a new low. The Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s (MBA) Market Composite Index, a measure of total mortgage application volume, increased 12.9% from December on a seasonally adjusted basis and was 61.3% higher than a year earlier. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed mortgages dropped 13 basis points (bps) to 6.2% following the announcement of $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) buybacks by the GSEs. Compared with January 2025, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 81 bps lower. The decline in rates supported month-over-month gains in both purchase and refinance activity. Purchase applications increased 2.9%, while refinance applications surged 19.8%. Relative to January 2025, purchase activity increased 16.2%, while refinance applications jumped 143.8%. By loan type, applications for fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) increased 12.9% and 7.9% month-over-month, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, FRM applications were up 57.8%, while ARM applications more than doubled, rising 113.1%. As of January 2026, ARMs accounted for an average of 7.1% of total applications on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, down 0.4 percentage points from December but 1.7 percentage points higher than a year earlier. For loan sizes, the average loan amount across the total market increased by 1.1% to $402,000. Average purchase loan sizes increased 2.5% to $435,400, while the refinance loan size increased modestly by 0.2% to $378,000. In contrast, the average ARM loan size continued to decline, falling 4.4% to $925,600.",

        "text_content": "One aspect of the housing bubble that doesn\u2019t get enough attention is how mortgage credit itself inflates prices. Beyond interest payments, the expansion of mortgage lending increases purchasing power without increasing housing supply, pushing prices further away from construction costs and fundamentals. This post looks at mortgages not just as personal debt, but as a systemic driver of housing inflation.",

When I bought my house during the pandemic bubble there was a bidding war and price moved up by 60k. Mortgage lender cancelled the appraisal and subbed in some person who they knew and worked with a lot and magically the house was appraised at the exact sale price. On one hand we have realtors overpricing homes to maximize their commission and lenders manipulating appraisals to increase lending and thus driving housing inflation. They have everything to gain from doing this, more interest, higher commissions, larger loan volumes. There\u2019s no truly independent layer in the process. It\u2019s turtles all the way down.",

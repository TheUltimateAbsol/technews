On the Linux side, Nvidia's drivers will be, but that market is relatively small and has had some help with the existence of DGX Spark. The CPU design is also possibly going to lead to some inconsistent performance issues. There are 4 types of threads, but as far as I can tell, all X925 and A725 cores are treated equally. The set of X925 and A725 cores on the larger L3 pool are faster than their counterparts with halved L3 cache. If your game gets put on the wrong CPU cluster, it's going to inexplicably perform worse for example. I'm sure these can be ironed out, but that weird split CPU design is going to be an extra thing to worry about. I feel like this chip would've been better off with the X925s and A725s as their own separate clusters rather than the 5+5+5+5 setup it has.",

When trying to find an answer for this question, I found this article and wanted to share it here. The largest DRAM manufacturers are Samsung and SK Hynix (both in South Korea), Micron (US) and CXMT (China). There is also a Taiwanese DRAM manufacturer called Nanya, but they have a very low DRAM market share and are much smaller compared to TSMC. Here are some excerpts from the article why Taiwanese DRAM is not as big as TSMC: >First, the government had always approached the DRAM industry with caution and apprehension. >Lee Kun-Hee, then 47-year-old Chairman of Samsung, even audaciously flew to Taiwan to meet with Morris Chang, Stan Shih, Chin-Tay Shih, and others, intending to deter Taiwan from entering the DRAM industry. >He offered several reasons, including Samsung\u2019s technological lead and first-mover advantage. More importantly, Samsung possessed vast financial resources, enabling it to weather the cyclical booms and busts of the DRAM market. He suggested that Taiwan, with its state-funded ventures, might be abandoned by the government during downturns. >In hindsight, this proved to be the most critical factor. \u201cOnly conglomerates can sustain the high-risk nature of the DRAM business\u2014mainly because they can leverage the financial resources of an entire nation,\u201d Shih and Chen explain in their book. >Moreover, thanks to financial and telecom liberalization in the 1980s, Samsung acquired a 49% stake in Korea Telecom and launched its own bank\u2014greatly enhancing its risk-taking capacity.",

        "score": 817,
        "text_content": "I feel like Nintendo are positioning these releases as similar to the Wii U ports that filled out the Switch 1's early days without understanding that the Wii U ports sold so well and were so popular with so many people because they were essentially new games to the overwhelming majority of Switch owners. Like most people, I didn't have a Wii U so getting Tropical Freeze, Mario Kart 8, Bayonetta 2, Hyrule Warriors all within the first year or so of the system's life felt like a massive deal. It was a shame for Wii U owners, sure, and I often saw them complain more at the time about the Switch's early line up, but the reality is they were a tiny minority of people. Meanwhile, even though I really liked Mario Wonder and I absolutely loved Kirby and the Forgotten Land, I have very little interest in these upgrade packs. If the DLC had come out 6 months post-release, I'd probably have been very interested, but on Switch 2, they just don't hit the same. And I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. When stuff like Tropical Freeze released, you'd see loads of posts around release from people playing the game. When Star-Crossed World released, I barely heard a peep. It almost seems like Nintendo haven't understood that the appeal of Mario Kart 8 etc was that to most Switch owners, that was effectively a new game - I'd imagine lots of casuals or younger players probably never even knew they were ports at all. With these Switch 2 editions, however, the ratio of people for whom these would feel like new games has flipped with probably 90% of Switch 2 owners having owned a Switch 1 and had access to these games for years (of course, for those few people who *didn't* have a Switch 1, they must feel like they're sat before an all-you-can-eat buffet). I feel like there's a big discrepancy between how much Nintendo is pushing these upgrade packs and the excitement / interest in them from players.",

Nearly 40,000 home-sale agreements nationwide were canceled in January, equal to 13.7% of homes that went under contract that month. That\u2019s up from 13.1% a year earlier, and the highest January share in records dating back to 2017. This is based on a Redfin analysis of MLS pending-sales data. The data is seasonal; typically, there\u2019s a higher share of cancellations at the end of the year and a lower share in the spring. That\u2019s why we compare this January to past Januarys. Please note: Homes that fell out of contract during a given month didn\u2019t necessarily go under contract that same month. This data is subject to revision. Sales are falling through at a higher rate than in the past largely because it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market, with hundreds of thousands more U.S. home sellers than buyers. That gives buyers negotiating power; they may back out during the inspection period if they see a home they like better or an inspection issue arises. Another major reason buyers are backing out of deals is financial uncertainty. While housing costs have come down from their peak, they are still near historic highs. Some would-be buyers are canceling purchases because they\u2019re getting jittery about buying a house when they\u2019re anxious about things like layoffs, tariffs and geopolitical tensions. \u201cMore buyers are backing out,\u201d said Alin Glogovicean, a Redfin Premier agent in Los Angeles, where 16.7% of home purchase agreements were cancelled in January, up from 15% a year earlier. \u201cThey\u2019re second-guessing the wisdom of making a huge purchase when there\u2019s a fear in the back of their mind about the state of the economy and the uncertainty of their finances. That\u2019s particularly true when they\u2019re first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from a previous home sale, and they\u2019re using most or all of their savings on a down payment.\u201d San Antonio, Atlanta Have the Highest Cancellation Rates, Bay Area Has the Lowest In San Antonio, more than one in five (21.2%) home-purchase agreements were canceled in January, the highest share of the 47 major U.S. metros Redfin analyzed. It\u2019s followed by Atlanta (18.5%) and Cleveland (17.9%). Riverside, CA (17.5%) and Orlando, FL (17.3%) round out the top five. Cancellations are especially common in those places largely because they\u2019re mostly buyer\u2019s markets, with many more home sellers than buyers, giving buyers the option to back out of deals and move on to the next house. In San Antonio, for instance, there are twice as many sellers as buyers, and in Atlanta, there are 80% more. On the other end of the spectrum, just 3.5% of home-purchase agreements in San Francisco were canceled in January, the lowest share of the metros Redfin analyzed. It\u2019s followed by Nassau County, NY (4.8%), San Jose, CA (5.3%), Milwaukee (7.6%) and Oakland, CA (8.4%). Contract Cancellations Are on the Rise in Most Metros Contract cancellations increased most in San Antonio, rising from 15.6% last January to 21.2% this year. Next come Cleveland (17.9%, up from 14.9%) and San Jose, CA (5.3%, up from 2.9%). The share of home-purchase cancellations fell year over year in 11 of the metros in this analysis. The biggest decline was in Tampa, FL (15.1%, down from 17%). It\u2019s followed by Milwaukee (7.6%, down from 9.3%) and Nassau County, NY (4.8%, down from 6.4%).",

House prices for the fourth quarter of 2025 rose 0.8 percent compared to the third quarter of 2025. FHFA\u2019s seasonally adjusted monthly index for December rose 0.1 percent from November. Significant Findings - Nationally, the U.S. housing market has experienced positive annual appreciation each quarter since the start of 2012. - House prices rose in 41 states between the fourth quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2025. The five states with the highest annual appreciation were 1) North Dakota, 6.4 percent; 2) Delaware, 6.3 percent; 3) Illinois, 6.1 percent; 4) Wisconsin, 5.7 percent; and 5) Michigan, 5.5 percent. House prices were down in nine states and the District of Columbia. Florida experienced the most significant price decline at 2.7 percent. - House prices rose in 66 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas over the previous four quarters. The annual price increase was the greatest in Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ at 8.9 percent. The metropolitan area that experienced the most significant price decline was Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL at 9.1 percent. - Six of the nine census divisions had positive house price changes year-over-year. The East North Central division recorded the strongest appreciation, posting a 5.0 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the fourth quarter of 2025. The Mountain division recorded a 0.2 percent decline. - Trends in the Top 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas are available in our interactive dashboard: https://www.fhfa.gov/data/dashboard/fhfa-hpi-top-100-metro-area-rankings. The first tab displays rankings, and the second tab offers charts. The FHFA HPI is a comprehensive collection of publicly available house price indexes that measure changes in single-family home values based on data that extend back to the mid-1970s from all 50 states and over 400 American cities. It incorporates tens of millions of home sales and offers insights about house price changes at the national, census division, state, metro area, county, ZIP code, and census tract levels. FHFA uses a fully transparent methodology based upon a weighted, repeat-sales statistical technique to analyze house price transaction data. FHFA releases HPI data and reports quarterly and monthly. The flagship FHFA HPI uses seasonally adjusted, purchase-only data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additional indexes use other data including refinances, mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration, and real property records.

                "raw_content": "- The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index posted a 1.3% annual gain for December 2025, down from a 1.4% rise in the previous month. - Inflation outpaced home price appreciation from June 2025 onward, eroding real home values through year-end and reversing a decade-long trend of positive real returns. - Geographic divergence widened sharply: Chicago and New York led all markets with gains above 5%, while Tampa, Phoenix, Dallas, and Miami posted the steepest declines among markets that finished the year in negative territory. ANALYSIS \u201cWith December's results, we can now assess 2025's full-year performance in historical context,\u201d said Nicholas Godec, CFA, CAIA, CIPM, Head of Fixed Income Tradables & Commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \"National home prices grew just 1.3% for the year \u2014 the weakest full-year gain since 2011, when prices fell 3.9%, and 5.3 percentage points below the 6.6% 10-year annual average. Even excluding 2021's near-20% Covid-era surge, the 10-year average annual gain stands at 5.2%, still 3.9 percentage points ahead of this year's result. \u201cTwo structural forces have reshaped the market over recent years: mortgage rates and inflation,\u201d Godec continued. \"The 30-year mortgage rate closed 2025 at 6.2%, well above the 4.8% 10-year average and a sharp contrast to the 3.9% average that prevailed from 2016 through 2020. Meanwhile, annual inflation for 2025 came in at 2.7% \u2014 modestly below the 3.1% 10-year average \u2014 but still outpaced home price appreciation by 1.4 percentage points, effectively eroding real home values for most owners. This marks a notable reversal: Over the prior decade, national home prices outpaced inflation by 3.7 percentage points annually, a dynamic that has quietly reversed, with real home price returns turning negative in June 2025. \u201cDecomposing 2025 price returns reveals a year of two halves,\" Godec concluded. \"The first six months saw prices rise 2.6%, while the back half delivered nominal declines of 1.3% \u2014 and every one of the 20 tracked metro areas posted negative price returns over that same period. At the city level, Chicago (+5.3%), New York (+5.1%), Cleveland (+4.0%), and Minneapolis (+2.7%) led all markets for the full year, while Tampa (-2.9%), Denver (-2.1%), Phoenix (-1.5%), Dallas (-1.5%), and Miami (-1.5%) posted the steepest declines. This geographic divergence reflects the broader reordering underway: Historically steady Midwest and Northeast markets continued to outperform as Sun Belt markets that surged during the pandemic cycle extended their correction.\u201d YEAR-OVER-YEAR The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 1.3% annual gain for December. The 10-City Composite saw an annual increase of 1.9%, down from a 2.0% increase in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a year-over-year increase of 1.4%, in line with the previous month. Chicago reported the highest annual gain among the 20 cities with a 5.3% increase in December, followed by New York and Cleveland with annual increases of 5.1% and 4.0%, respectively. Tampa posted the lowest return in December, falling 2.9%. The chart below compares year-over-year returns for different housing price ranges (tiers) in Chicago. MONTH-OVER-MONTH The pre-seasonally adjusted U.S. National Index saw a drop of 0.3%, and both the 10-City Composite and the 20-City Composite Indices decreased 0.1%. After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index reported a monthly increase of 0.4%, and both the 10-City Composite and 20-City Composite Indices posted month-over-month gains of 0.5%. SUPPORTING DATA The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, which covers all nine U.S. census divisions, recorded a 1.3% annual increase in December 2025. The 10-City and 20-City Composites reported year-over-year increases of 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively.The chart below depicts the annual returns of the U.S. National, 10-City Composite, and 20-City Composite Home Price Indices. https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/index-news-and-announcements/CSHomePrice_Release_0224.pdf",

                "raw_content": "I've read that prices and regions are like other asset markets now. By that I mean that expensive homes, similar to expensive stocks, are often still increasing because the usually older, but any wealthy demographic still has disposable income and theyr'e doing most of the spending, and therefore can still push expensive properties, like stocks, higher. Last year the average homebuyer was 59, I think. That seems nuts. Can anyone confirm this - bifurcation by property value? I guess it could also be common at or near the peak of a cycle, if that's the case now - higher rates and record prices. I quit following the market closely but I'm interested in economic patterns. I just don't have the time or resources to conduct this kind of research myself. Most of the available housing data we get, like this national price index, is aggregate data and doesn't break down these kinds of unique trends. If this theory is true, it means competition at the low and mid range of the market could be more price sensitive and therefore more responsive to changing market conditions and pre-financialization of the industry, such as historic wage to home price values. That's good for lower wages and FTB's, unless the properties are picked off by investors - who own 25% of US SFH's right now. This should be disincentivized, IMO. For the very richest, they're just not as impacted through any cycle, all things considered, and they've never been doing so well anyway. That could keep aggregate figures high, and for longer, while specific regions and the low to mid end could see greater price corrections. I don't really know. I'm curious to find out though.",

        "score": 176,
        "text_content": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01797 Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations \u2013 plausible but factually incorrect outputs \u2013 undermining their reliability. While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remark-ably sparse subset of neurons (less than 0.1% of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.",

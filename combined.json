I disagree with them that \"50ms is fine\" but holy crap the base latency on games without Reflex is actually awful. No wonder I had such a hard time with Cyberpunk feeling wobbly and slow even on a good framerate: 80ms base latency???? Reflex is THE selling point for me because of how widely supported it is. Like you can use Optiscaler to inject XeLL and AL2 into certain singleplayer games and all but AMD really isn't trying to get it into everything like Nvidia is. Also for the record as someone who jumped from a 3070 to 5070 for 4k on a 240hz monitor: 3x mfg is totally fine and yeah it has some artifacting if I look for it, it's not actually on the important parts of the image. Personally I found FSR 3 FG fine too. What I DON'T like is that there is indeed a ~10ms latency jump from Reflex on and no FG. I can manage it in a game like Expedition 33 by simply anticipating the button press earlier but it's a harder sell in anything like a shooter. What I usually do to get around it is unironically just increase my base framerate and switch to DLSS Ultra Performance with the L model which looks way better than DLSS Performance at 1440p btw. Like, I can only tell if I'm looking at particles or lines in the distance, it's great.",

I just bought a mini PC with an N150, supposed to be a new version of the N100, but it's 1-2% faster. Same awful performance, in another iteration.

Whether that's true or not remains to be seen, but one thing it made me realize is this: I'd be pretty damn excited for a Partner Direct right now! Let's be honest, on Switch 1, Partner Directs were starting to become almost indistinuishable from Indie Worlds - which isn't exactly a complaint (I love a good indie myself), I'm just saying expectations for big AAA games turning up were pretty low. But on Switch 2? That expectation would be a lot higher. First of all, you've got multiple cool games we *know* are coming in 2026 that just need a concrete date: Elden Ring, Fallout 4, Indiana Jones, The Duskbloods, Adventures of Elliot, Professor Layton etc Then you've got the heavily rumoured games like: Hi-Fi Rush, Stellar Blade, Expedition 33, Final Fantasy XVI, Metaphor ReFantazio etc Plus, the potential for just about anything else. XBox keep saying they're so excited to support the Switch 2 so surely one day that has to translate into something concrete with some Halo, Doom, CoD, Starfield, Gears or whatever. Capcom don't talk as much as Phil Spencer but they clearly *are* heavily supporting the Switch 2 so some Monster Hunter or Devil May Cry sound feasible. A lot of the annual franchises look to be getting on board too, so basically, just a whole heap of potential good stuff. And obviously I do not expect all - or even close to all - of the above to be in one presentation, but that's a flavour of the sort of stuff we may well see, and I think a Partner Direct right now could actually be pretty awesome.",

I told you the concept was terrible and that the game would probably flop.

However isn't that only half the story? If he kids don't inherit the house so it's available for someone else to purchase creating supply.. *don't the kids now need to buy a house creating a matching demand*? Wouldn't that create an equivalent level of price inflation as them keeping the house to begin with? I would have thought that increasing supply to outstrip demand would be the best way to lower prices as it doesn't require an economic shock with massive job loss, unemployment and homeless to create a supply, doesn't increase taxes on those who bought a cheap house when they could afford it but are now being crushed by increased homeowner costs of insurance and property taxes etc. (this last paragraph shows how I don't understand the problem or solution..)",

                "raw_content": "- In 2025, inherited homes reached a record 7% of all U.S. property transfers, totaling 340,000 properties. - In California, favorable tax laws incentivize beneficiaries to use an inherited home as a primary residence. For the first time this year, passed-down homes more than doubled the number of new homes sold in the state. - However, the anticipated \"Silver Tsunami\" of housing supply will be delayed as seniors age in place and hold on to their historic volume of homes for longer periods. Urbanists and Yes-In-My-Back-Yard (YIMBY) enthusiasts often propose a silver bullet solution for the housing affordability crisis gripping the nation\u2014build, baby, build! But new construction is not the only way to increase available supply. For years, analysts have held out hope that the aging Baby Boomer generation would trigger the \"Silver Tsunami\" \u2014 a massive wave of homes unlocked and returned to the market. However, new data from Cotality suggests the Tsunami may, instead, hit the beach as a soft, rolling wave. Inheritance has always played a role in the real estate economy, and recently that role has grown. According to Cotality\u2019s unmatched database of property deeds, a record 340,000 homes across the United States were transferred through inheritance in the 12 months ending in August 2025. With resales falling, 7% of all property transfers were hand-me-downs \u2014 the highest share Cotality has ever recorded (see Chart 1). This trend is most pronounced in California, where the tax system rewards keeping homes in the family, easing the transfer from long-time owners to their heirs. There, property tax increases over 2% per year are prohibited, regardless of the change in the market value of the home. That tax exemption canbe inherited by children and grandchildren on the first $1M of inherited real estate value given that the property is used as a primary residence and continuously lived in. It's clear that these laws create a significant financial incentive for beneficiaries to hold onto the inherited home and use it as a primary residence, effectively locking potential supply out of the open market. Nearly 60,000 Golden State properties were inherited in 2025, accounting for 18% of all property transfers, another record-breaking number (see Chart 2). For the first time ever in California, that is more than twice the number of new homes sold. At first glance, the increase in inheritances seems to validate the \"Silver Tsunami\" hypothesis. But Cotality's deeper analysis of U.S. Census data reveals that such optimism may be unfounded. Today's seniors are holding onto their houses longer, effectively freezing the anticipated flow of supply. The U.S. Baby Boomer generation is the largest group of seniors in the United States on record, and they own a historic number of houses. At age 65, people born in 1948 owned 50% more houses than those born just ten years earlier at the same age (see Chart 3). Critically, they are also more likely to age in place. More than 22% of homeowners born in 1938 left their homes between the ages of 65 and 75. That rate drops sharply for homeowners born in 1946 \u2014 only 17% of whom left their homes during the same 10-year period of life (see Chart 4). Aging in place slows the natural cycle of downsizing, moving in with family, and ultimately passing homes to the next generation. This delays the long-predicted wave of housing supply from arriving on the open market, and in many cases, those homes will skip the open market entirely. There will still be beneficiaries from the surplus of housing held by seniors. With homes being inherited during a low affordability era, compounded by policies such as California's tax incentives that encourage heirs to use an inherited property as their primary residence, more heirs will choose to keep and live in those homes. Policymakers hoping to improve affordability cannot count on demographic destiny to save the day. While inheritance can be a lifeline for some families coping with historically high housing costs, those waiting on inheritances to rebalance supply and demand are likely to be left out in the cold. If America wants supply, we must build it. https://www.cotality.com/insights/articles/why-inherited-homes-wont-solve-the-housing-crisis",

        "text_content": "The newly open sourced LingBot-World report reveals a breakthrough capability where the model effectively builds an implicit map of the world rather than just hallucinating pixels based on probability. This emergent understanding allows it to reason about spatial logic and unobserved states purely through next-frame prediction. The \"Stonehenge Test\" demonstrates this perfectly. You can observe a complex landmark, turn the camera away for a full 60 seconds, and when you return, the structure remains perfectly intact with its original geometry preserved. It even simulates unseen dynamics. If a vehicle drives out of the frame, the model continues to calculate its trajectory off-screen. When you pan the camera back, the car appears at the mathematically correct location rather than vanishing or freezing in place. This signals a fundamental shift from models that merely dream visuals to those that truly simulate physical laws.",

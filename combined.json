        "text_content": "We've recently gotten lots of leaks, somewhat verified thanks to declarations from Rockstar. Two of the big ones are lists of details posted by user u/Snowk32 (now deleted) on two [different ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/17ad683/gta_vi_plot_mechanics/)[posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/16st1vu/predictions_about_the_game/), as well as the known details from [GameRoll](https://xcancel.com/GameRoll_/status/1931398779669712944). Another list of leaks that holds some credibility is [LegacyKillaHD's ](https://xcancel.com/LegacyKillaHD/status/1833191000543506604)list, since he shared some details that ended up matching the second trailer. This list compiles every detail posted by them through posts in Reddit, X, or Discord messages. # Story: * The game has chapters like RDR2, 5 chapters in total. Shots from Trailer 2 were all from Chapters 1-3. * Jason served some time in the army. * Lucia is the central character of this story, as Michael is to 5. * Lucia/Jason have separate intro missions. * Lucia has a baby that she abandons at a delicatessen before heading out to a bank robbery and then getting arrested for doing such an act. * Lucia's baby is only shown in a cutscene as a flashback. There's no information about what happens to the baby after this point. * After a few years, Lucia gets released on probation, and she's picked up at the prison by Jason, who plans a robbery with her. They fell in love with each other after some time. * Lucia gets rid of its ankle monitor pretty early on. * The part where they jump off the bike into the truck is from Chapter 3. * Donnie, Jason's friend who works for Brian and is described as a \"freak\". # Gameplay: * The character wheel has three options: Solo Jason, Solo Lucia, and Dual Protagonist Control, where Lucia/Jason can be controlled simultaneously to team up in the open world. Some missions are also started using both at the same time. * Jason has a dead-eye-like ability, slows down time, and reveals weak spots. Lucia can do it too, but only on one shot. * Limited weapon system returns. Stored in the trunk. * 6 star wanted level returns. * Rectangle GPS with pink waypoints. * Driving is \"the best it's ever been\". * Greet and Antagonise is in the game. * Weight mechanics are a thing. * Gore/dismemberment is being built off of RDR2. * Lucia's ankle monitor doesn't affect exploration. * The cover system has been completely overhauled, and it\u2019s now much more realistic. * Trailer 2 scene where Jason buys beer is gameplay. You can go buy a six-pack from the shop as seen. * The relationship bar mentioned in the 2022 leaked clips still exists. Works like honour in RDR2. # Missions: * In the very first mission of the game, you control Jason, and you have to follow a plane that is about to land and carries a Russian drug dealer. Apparently, Jason meets this guy and plans a mission to steal drugs. * In this drug-stealing mission, they are chased by the police, and the drug ends up falling into the ocean. There is a following mission where they will have to dive to retrieve it. * The majority of the planning for the missions takes place at a nightclub. * There's a mission where you shoot a shark with a speargun. * Lucia sneaks into a bodybuilding gang. * There's a mission where cops betray each other, but the context is unknown. # Map: * The map is once again an Island. * No panhandle. * Besides Miami and its surrounding areas, there will be three islands in the game, one of them being heavily inspired by the Bahamas. (Note: this is from 2023, so keep that in mind) * Ambrosia and Port Gellhorn are nothing compared to the size of Vice City. Still big obviously, but VC is the biggest by far. * There\u2019s a \u201cFort\u201d city inspired by Fort Knox, where they \u201cstashed\u201d gold. * There\u2019s a bike trail around Lake Leonida. # Open world: * 700+ shops and most interiors of a major open-world game. There are shopping malls with shops in them, and there are skyscrapers with lifts in them. * Explorable underwater areas with treasure and secrets. * People do react if you have your gun out, and Jason and Lucia will try to hide their gun if they're walking with it out. * NPCs will call the police when you trespass into their houses, and they\u2019ll try to arrest you. * Basketball minigame. * You\u2019ll be able to rent hotels and motels in the game. * Male strippers are in the game. # Cut content: * One of the ideas that didn't go too far was voiced protagonists in Online. * Prone was cut a while ago. * The random encounter from the leaks, where the NPC talks about Jay Norris, got cut ages ago. # Non-existent content: * Listening to music outside of a car apparently isn't a thing, but that could change before launch. * You can't buy pets, but Jason does have a pet iguana that you can feed. * Dual-wielding weapons isn't in the game. * Chainsaw won\u2019t be a weapon, as it has been previously reported. * No fully nude sex scenes. * No Disney World parody. * No burglary mini-game.",

        "text_content": "Source: [Full Nerd Network (PC World)](https://youtu.be/v7_D9UBh6rk?t=398) PC World interviewed a technology industry analyst and revealed some interesting points: 1. Nvidia and Intel are partnering up for server AI because customers want x86. This is bad for ARM because it takes away share that used to be maintained by Nvidia's ARM server CPU. 2. The partnership wasn't done for gaming because gaming and laptops are not Nvidia's priority and they already control laptop gaming through their discrete graphics. 3. Analyst heard that another reason for lack of interest in gaming products is the decline of PC market by up to high single digit percentage due to memory shortage in 2026. Chip manufacturers are less interested in launching new products for PC because that is a declining market in the short run. E.g.

Flat Performance as 2025 Closes The US multifamily sector ended 2025 with advertised rents back to where they began the year, closing at $1,737 per unit in December according to Yardi Matrix. The fourth quarter saw a notable downturn, with national rents dropping 0.9% quarter-over-quarter\u2014marking the sector\u2019s weakest showing since the global financial crisis. National year-over-year rent growth fell to 0.0%. Market disparities persisted, with the Midwest and coastal gateway cities seeing modest growth, while Sun Belt markets led declines. Noteworthy growth occurred in New York (5.8% YoY), Chicago (3.6%), and the Twin Cities (3.2%), while Austin (-5.2%), Phoenix (-4.1%), and Denver (-3.9%) posted the largest declines. Occupancy Holds Despite Rent Headwinds Despite soft rent growth, multifamily occupancy rates remained stable at 94.6% nationally in November, virtually unchanged year-over-year. Renter retention strategies and fewer renters transitioning to homeownership helped cushion occupancy. Lifestyle occupancy ticked up 0.2% while Renter-by-Necessity occupancy dipped 0.2%, reflecting divergent renter price sensitivity. Midwestern markets, in particular, helped buoy national occupancy performance, continuing to show relative strength even as other regions softened. Owners continued to use lower renewal hikes and concessions throughout 2025 as demand moderated and rent growth normalized after 2021\u20132022\u2019s historic 22% surge. Regional Shifts and Supply Pressure Strong Midwest and coastal metros contrasted sharply with Sun Belt markets, which absorbed large new deliveries. Only six of the thirty largest metros recorded positive month-over-month rent growth in December, mostly in the Midwest. Affordability and restrained supply were key supports for these outperforming regions, while the Sun Belt remained soft as new supply outpaced demand. Multifamily Transaction Activity and Cap Rates Multifamily sales volume edged up in 2025 to $83.2B, led by Dallas, Seattle, Phoenix, and Miami. Despite high growth in secondary markets, investors continue paying the lowest cap rates for gateway assets\u2014San Francisco\u2019s South Bay (3.8%) and Manhattan (4.1%) among them\u2014highlighting sustained appetite for prime-market multifamily. Cap rates remain tight against mortgage rates, underscoring intense competition and ample capital seeking multifamily exposure. Single-Family Rental Segment Trends Single-family build-to-rent (BTR) properties saw national advertised rents fall 1.0% year-over-year to $2,180 in December\u2014the lowest growth rate in a decade. Occupancy, though, held firm at 94.9% driven by stalled homebuying activity. BTR operators moderated rent increases to keep occupancy steady, especially in markets with new inventory pressure. Outlook for Multifamily in 2026 Looking ahead, modest rent growth is expected in 2026 as economic stability returns and GDP growth strengthens. Ongoing supply challenges in some metros and affordability constraints in gateway regions will remain key factors shaping multifamily rent performance over the coming year. Multifamily operators are likely to keep prioritizing retention and competitiveness amid ongoing market normalization.",

AMD\u2019s latest chip, however, has little to gain from even more clock speed, at least in games...Especially below $450, it\u2019s hard to justify the Ryzen 7 9850X3D over the 9800X3D when the latter offers almost identical performance with PBO enabled. And, although the Ryzen 7 9850X3D can climb higher, that extra clock speed doesn\u2019t amount to much in games \u2014 in our suite, it amounts to 0.9%.\"",

My resolution is 1080p, the 120hz toggle is turned on, all of my tv\u2019s settings are set, and yet it just won\u2019t work. Is there something I\u2019m perhaps missing? I\u2019m using the hdmi cable that came with the switch 2 itself, so that shouldn\u2019t be a problem either. I\u2019m plugged into HDM1, which supports up to 144hz/fps. Starting to think there may just be a problem with my switch 2, that I\u2019ve had since launch day. If you have any insight as to what could be going wrong, please do let me know. Quite frustrating to not be able to play with the settings I should be able to. Thank you for your time! MASSIVE edit 1: Folks, I apologize - I didn\u2019t have the switch 2 edition installed.

I\u2019d like to see alternate costumes added for more characters though, right now there\u2019s only a few alternate color options for some characters. The other thing I\u2019d like to see patched is in a random button for selecting Fever rackets. You can randomize everything else but those for some reason.

The \"base\" version of GPT 5.1 Thinking got it right on first try though: https://chatgpt.com/share/698d870c-9c04-8006-9ec5-0afb91dcff6c The \"base\" version of GPT 5.2 Thinking behaved like yours and failed. However, if you literally just tell it to \"think carefully\", it passes no problem: https://chatgpt.com/share/698d87cb-a3c4-8006-be0f-890b2e592959 I have a project with custom instructions specifically for math, as I'm a math teacher, and it also passes without additional instructions there: https://chatgpt.com/share/698d8646-1ed0-8006-904e-e93ce9cee42a I simply think there is a *massive* capabilities overhang in how people use these models. Like, all of these \"base\" versions of these models within the chat interface have system prompts for instance, so it's not even a one to one comparison necessarily. You know that OpenAI hard ~~coded~~ prompted things like strawberry has 3 r's into the system prompt right? You can add your own system prompts that fix a bunch of these \"trick\" questions. There's entire agentic frameworks that people can use to push capabilities much higher out of \"base\" models, like that new math thing Google published yesterday.",

(Had to disguise it as a low-effort Twitter vaguepost for the mods.) This longform piece on Anthropic/Claude in The New Yorker surprised me. It's the first time I've seen AI coverage in a high-profile literary magazine be accurate. The author, Gideon Lewis-Kraus, even criticizes n+1 magazine editors for equating next-token prediction pre-training with autocomplete, which is a level of nuance I did not expect at all. And look at this: > Some of the most perceptive insights about the behavior of models came courtesy of the \"A.I. psychonauts,\" a loose cohort of brilliantly demented model whisperers outside Anthropic, who are shrouded in esoteric pseudonyms like Janus and Nostalgebraist. They cover interpretability experiments, Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon, the Claudius vending machine, effective altruism, the history of Anthropic and deep learning at large ... It's almost bizarre that they let Lewis-Kraus take the story in this direction. It's basic stuff for the most part, but the coverage is positive. Unusual.",

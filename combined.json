        "text_content": "I was reading [this article](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/why-raspberry-pi-isnt-vulnerable-to-spectre-or-meltdown/) on how Spectre and Meltdown worked, and while I get what the example code is doing, there is a key piece that I'm surprised works the way it does, as I would never have designed a chip to work that way if I'd been designing one. Namely, the surprise is that an illegal instruction actually *still executes* even if it faults. What I mean is, if w = kern_mem[address] is an illegal operation, then I get that the processor should not actually fault until it's known whether the branch that includes this instruction is actually taken. What I *don't* see is why the w register (or whatever \"shadow register\" it's saved into pending determining whether to *actually* update the processor state with the result of this code path) still contains the *actual value* of kern\\_mem\\[address\\] despite the illegality of the instruction. It would seem that the output of an illegal instruction would be undefined behavior, especially since in an actual in-order execution scenario the fault would prevent the output from actually being used. Thus it would seem that there is nothing lost by having it output a dummy value that has no relation to the actual opcode \"executed\". This would be almost trivial to do in hardware--when an instruction faults, the circuit path to output the result is simply not completed, so this memory fetch \"reads\" whatever logic values the data bus lines are biased to when they're not actually connected to anything. This could be logical 0, logical 1, or even \"Heisen-bits\" that sometimes read 0 and sometimes 1, regardless there is no actual information about the data in kernel memory leaked. Any subsequent speculative instructions would condition on the dummy value, not the real value, thus only potentially revealing the dummy value (which might be specified in the processor data sheet or not--but in any case knowing it wouldn't seem to help construct an exploit). This would seem to break the entire vulnerability--and it's possible this is what the mitigation in fact ended up doing, but I'm left scratching my head wondering why these processors weren't designed this way from the start. I'm guessing that possibly there are situations where operations are only *conditionally* illegal, thus potentially leading to such a dummy value actually being used in the final execution path when the operation is in fact legal but speculatively mis-predicted to be illegal. Possibly there are even cases where being able to determine whether an operation IS legal or not itself acts as a side channel. The authors of that article say that the real exploit is more complex--maybe if I knew the actual exploit code this would be answered. Anyway, can anyone here explain?",

        "text_content": "Every month at least until June there is another big game dropping for Switch 2 that I want to pick up. January - FF7 Remake. Yes I already played this on PS5, but it\u2019s a banger and I\u2019m perfectly happy to double-dip for less than $50. February - DQ7 Reimagined. I still haven\u2019t beaten DQ11 yet, nor I have I picked up 1-3 HD2D remakes\u2026but this looks fantastic. I may spend the next month binging DQ11 to clear it from my backlog and get ready for this one. Also February - Resident Evil Requiem. I\u2019ve only played the first section of Resident Evil 0 before but I\u2019m really interested in this one. I love the new female protagonist, and Leon Kennedy looks cool too. Being able to swap between two completely different play styles depending on whose arc you\u2019re following sounds really interesting. This may be the game that finally gets me into RE properly, although I may not get it quite at launch if I decide to catch up with the rest of the series first. March - MHS3: Twisted Reflection. Just seeing this one revealed at the Switch 2 direct last summer instantly made me interested in Monster Hunter as a franchise. I bought the digital bundle for the first two games on sale, and they\u2019re fantastic. I also bought World and Wild for PS5, but honestly I love the turn-based combat in the Stories games much more than the real-time combat in the mankije games. And this one looks even better than the first two. Can\u2019t wait. April - Pragmata. I was not expecting this game to suddenly be announced for Switch 2 at TGA but now that it has been I definitely want to pick it up. I might have still gotten it on PS5 eventually, but I\u2019m very interested to see how Capcom pulls this off. The game looks stunning, and the gameplay looks engaging with an interesting story on top of that. May - 007 First Light. I haven\u2019t played a James Bond game since Goldeneye on the N64, but I like the Uncharted-esque exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving that this one seems to have. It\u2019s probably the closest we\u2019ll ever get to having Uncharted on Switch unless Sony decides to port over Golden Abyss or something, so I\u2019m down to give it a try. The recent developer comments about the game and how they\u2019ve chosen to portray James Bond are concerning, but I\u2019m going to try to keep an open mind for at least a while longer. Meanwhile, the only first-party Nintendo games coming out next year that I have any interest in are Splatoon Raiders and Fire Emblem: Fortune\u2019s Weave, whose release dates are unconfirmed. I\u2019m guessing Splatoon will drop in the summer, maybe in June, whereas Fire Emblem will be in the fall, to serve as both the big holiday release and Nintendo\u2019s submission for GOTY. During the Game Cube, Wii and Switch 1 eras, people got used to Nintendo consoles being carried by first party-titles, but in the Switch 2 era this is clearly changing. Nintendo is spending more time developing its games and allowing third parties to fill in the time in between. This is what Sony has already been doing for years, except that unlike Sony Nintendo has actually put out quality content that made the wait feel worth it. I think this strategy will work out well for them in the long run. Going forward, I will only get a game on PS5 or Xbox if there\u2019s no chance of it coming to Switch 2 at any point in the foreseeable future (i.e., Sony exclusives). Otherwise, I can just wait for the Switch 2 version to eventually come out a few months later, assuming it isn\u2019t already released day and date, which a lot of games are starting to be nowadays. It\u2019s never been a better time to be a Nintendo gamer.",

The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order, if a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step. * If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet. * If you have any power related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages, such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB and 3.3V rails can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose. * Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard or system manual. * If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers or buttons you can use, please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS. * If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on. * Make your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have \u2014 most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which allows you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB. * If you are using an AMD Radeon RX 6000, RX 7000, RX 9000 or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30, RTX 40 or RTX 50 GPU, please ensure you are using separate 6 - 8pin PCIe cables or dedicated 12VHPWR/12V-2x6 cables and not using daisy-chained or splitter cables, as these may not be able to supply adequate power to the GPU. Please consult your GPU and PSU manual for information on how to correctly connect your GPU. * Make sure your Monitor or TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor or TV and if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters or splitters, remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables. * Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games and applications. * Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs and other performance, security, stability and compatibility issues. * Make sure you are running the latest [AMD Chipset or Graphics Drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html).

These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability. * If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP \u2014 to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings \u2014 this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner or Ryzen Master, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities as well. * If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7HOS6UiOBXAWtNFBJ0w70f14izRQcBYD9puuSw6Ghs/edit?usp=sharing) * If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the *below PSU calculators* and make sure the PSU you have (or intend to buy) can supply enough power when your system is under full load \u2014 If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load. * PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html) \u2014 [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/) \u2014 [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator) \u2014 [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/) \u2014 [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator) \u2014 [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator) \u2014 You can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage. * Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc... * If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdown or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Remember that **just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable** and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system \u2014 many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it. --- [OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/occt/personal) \u2014 OCCT is the only comprehensive stability testing software available. 20 years of experience have proved OCCT to be the community's software of choice in terms of stability and performance testing.

Is there any truth to my hypothesis that Play Station PC ports are likely to be relatively well-optimized for AMD GPUs, given that the Play Station 5 itself is indeed some variant of RDNA? I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware? It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect. But I just haven't really heard much discussion of what, if any, overlap we get optimization-wise for games that were optimized first and foremost for the AMD-based Play Station 5.",

        "text_content": "We are entering 2026 with a clear **reasoning gap**. Frontier models are scoring extremely well on STEM-style benchmarks, but the new **Misguided Attention** results show they still struggle with basic instruction following and simple logic variations. **What stands out from the benchmark:** **Gemini 3 Flash on top:** Gemini 3 Flash leads the leaderboard at **68.5%**, beating larger and more expensive models like GPT-5.2 & Opus 4.5 **It tests whether models actually read the prompt:** Instead of complex math or coding, the benchmark tweaks familiar riddles. One example is a trolley **problem** that mentions \u201cfive dead people\u201d to see if the model notices the detail or blindly applies a memorized template. **High scores are still low in absolute terms:** Even the best-performing models fail a large share of these cases. This suggests that **adding** more reasoning tokens does not help much if the model is already overfitting to common patterns. Overall, the results point to a gap between **pattern matching** and **literal deduction**. Until that gap is closed, highly autonomous agents are likely to remain brittle in real-world settings. **Does Gemini 3 Flash\u2019s lead mean Google has better latent reasoning here or is it simply less overfit than flagship reasoning models?** Source: [GitHub (MisguidedAttention)](https://github.com/Ueaj-Kerman/MisguidedAttention) Source: [Official Twitter thread](https://x.com/i/status/2006835678663864529)",

        "score": 575,
        "text_content": "DeepSeek just dropped mHC (Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections), and it looks like a real new scaling knob: you can make the model\u2019s main \u201cthinking stream\u201d wider (more parallel lanes for information) without the usual training blow-ups. Why this is a big deal - Standard Transformers stay trainable partly because residual connections act like a stable express lane that carries information cleanly through the whole network. - Earlier \u201cHyper-Connections\u201d tried to widen that lane and let the lanes mix, but at large scale things can get unstable (loss spikes, gradients going wild) because the skip path stops behaving like a simple pass-through. - The key idea with mHC is basically: widen it and mix it, but force the mixing to stay mathematically well-behaved so signals don\u2019t explode or vanish as you stack a lot of layers. What they claim they achieved - Stable large-scale training where the older approach can destabilize. - Better final training loss vs the baseline (they report about a 0.021 improvement on their 27B run). - Broad benchmark gains (BBH, DROP, GSM8K, MMLU, etc.), often beating both the baseline and the original Hyper-Connections approach. - Only around 6.7% training-time overhead at expansion rate 4, thanks to heavy systems work (fused kernels, recompute, pipeline scheduling). If this holds up more broadly, it\u2019s the kind of quiet architecture tweak that could unlock noticeably stronger foundation models without just brute-forcing more FLOPs.",

I'm not sure how accurate of an analogy it is, but I thought it was interesting: \"Traditional scaling is like building a taller skyscraper with more floors, this new dimension is like **widening the elevator shafts and corridors** to allow more people (information) to move between those floors simultaneously without needing to change the speed of the elevators themselves.\"",

        "text_content": "There is an important paradigm shift underway in AI that most people outside frontier labs and the AI-for-math community missed in 2025. The bottleneck is no longer just scale. It is verification. From math, formal methods, and reasoning-heavy domains, what became clear this year is that intelligence only compounds when outputs can be checked, corrected, and reused. Proofs, programs, and reasoning steps that live inside verifiable systems create tight feedback loops. Everything else eventually plateaus. This is why AI progress is accelerating fastest in math, code, and formal reasoning. It is also why breakthroughs that bridge informal reasoning with formal verification matter far more than they might appear from the outside. Terry Tao recently described this as mass-produced specialization complementing handcrafted work. That framing captures the shift precisely. We are not replacing human reasoning. We are industrializing certainty. I wrote a 2025 year-in-review as a primer for people outside this space to understand why verification, formal math, and scalable correctness will be foundational to scientific acceleration and AI progress in 2026. If you care about AGI, research automation, or where real intelligence gains come from, this layer is becoming unavoidable.",

I personally think that any job which demands a high level of personal accountability (such as that of an airline pilot, nuclear plant security, chief editor, CEO, or surgeon) is among the most difficult to automate, because robots and AI cannot assume responsibility for consequential failures where the stakes are exceptionally high. While current machines and AI could handle most of their tasks already, a human must ultimately be in charge. In a way, that human is taking the role of verifying the action of AI. Such positions are currently rare but I wonder if they may become more common in the near future.",

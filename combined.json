Intel pulled off massive wins with Nehalem and Sandy Bridge, bolstered by the fact that AMD's Bulldozer architecture was such a monumental catastrophe. That was 2011. Ivy Bridge was marginally better, and maybe you could excuse it as a Tick-Tock thing. But every subsequent generation after that was marginal improvements in the 4c 4/8t package. They stopped enthuasiast parts too. Skylake was an unmitigated disaster to such a point that Apple finally decided enough was enough and went to work on Apple Silicon. Keep in mind that Apple was sending them issues with Intel's silicon for years before they finally decided Intel wasn't a reliable partner. So if you count it from 2012, that's 13 straight years of complacency and mismanagement. Meanwhile, in the same time, AMD produced two brand new architectures (even though one flopped), and I believe they also had an ARM architecture planned which they couldn't complete because of cashflow concerns. Lip-Bu Tan also doesn't inspire any confidence like Lisa Su does. At her heart, she's an engineer. He's a bean counter. While I can agree with discontinuing some of the many fabs they've been building, you shouldn't be laying off engineers. You should be doubling down on them. Go fall at Jim Keller's feet and have him assemble a team like AMD did for Zen. Intel won't die. The USA won't allow such a crucial technology company to die off, but this will go the way of Boeing, with mismanagement and global distrust about the company.",

It is easily worth the asking price and they could honestly get away for asking more if they wanted. The value here is really good. Not all 50 games here are amazing, and honestly a few I would consider pretty bad, but the vast majority range from fun to really brilliant. A few of these games could get away being a separate release and they would be worth the asking price of this entire game. If you're a fan of NES classics, this is a must play. The graphics, sound, and controls are a cut above any actual NES game outside of something like Mario 3, yet the charm and love is all there with each one. The game is also perfect for handheld play as well as local multiplayer....around half of the game have 2 player mode and all you need are 2 joycons on the side since each game only used movement and 2 buttons max. Overall easily a standout title and IMO a must have for any fan of the NES or classic games in general.",

There are only 4 players on the map, rather than 8 player co-op (this could be due to Grief making a potential return, which made its return in BO6 and may likely be in BO7). And with the Original Crew's return (with mixed split results because that's the COD Zombies community for you), all I'm hoping is good writing as well, seeing how both OG and BO6 Crews interact with each other. There's a [thread going on about why BO6 Zombies Dark Aether narrative dipped after DLC 1](https://xcancel.com/GMingle2695/status/1953948064361628006#m), but that's just speculation and a grain of salt for sure.",

It UNMASKS it using whatever story your brain already knows. Most people I\u2019ve seen with AI-psychosis had other stressors = sleep loss, drugs, mood episodes. AI was the trigger, but not the gun. Meaning there's no \"AI-induced schizophrenia\" This psychiatrist is not blaming AI for causing people to be hospitalized (even though he first said \"because of AI\"). What he is saying is that these AI chats can be a trigger for people who already has (possibly dormant) issues. To me it seems like the issue, if we take this post at face value and believe it to be true, is constant validation and the echo chamber dynamic. This would also mean that social media that lets or encourages users to join echo chambers could also be a trigger. Too much validation seems to be the issue.",

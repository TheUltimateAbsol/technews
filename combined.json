For decades and decades there has been a prevailing delusion among those in power on the Right that the appearance of being the 'good guy' is just as valuable, and in fact more valuable, than actual demonstrable and actionable wins with real substance. The Right has been chasing after this fanciful dream that if they can only show that they are more principled, more upstanding, more morally consistent, more honest, more honorable, etc than the left, then it won't matter how much real power the left amasses, the nation will 'somehow' reward the Right with a decisive victory. That if enough people just see us being the 'good guys' and the left openly being the bad guys, we will be granted a win because we deserve it. None of that has ever been true. Power is there to be grasped by someone, and it will be grasped by whoever has the determination to do so, no matter their moral character. The Left has no honor or principles, but they know we do, so they have been more than willing to use that against us. They have, and continue to, frame every fight in such a way that we can achieve a 'moral victory' by ceding the real world power to them *or* take real world power for ourselves but look bad doing it, knowing that we've always picked the first option every time, because of that delusion. This is a moment where we see if those in power have finally given up on that delusion. We have the chance to take a real win that means something and can last and have real positive effects on whose worldview and policy gets moved forward and whose gets left behind. Us or them. But in order for it to be us, we, and I mean those on the Right in power, have to be willing to look like the bad guys. They have to be willing to say \"yeah, this redistricting stuff is pretty slimy, but the Left is doing it and now so are we. That's the way this works\". They have to be willing to take the mud that will be slung at them in exchange for a real win of substance. We are about to see if the past decade or so has finally taught the Right the most important political lesson of all: win first. Worry about how it looks later.",

A flashing sign alerted traffic of delays due to an accident farther ahead. We eventually caught up to the bumper to bumper traffic, and saw a tractor trailer in the median, completely torn apart. Seeing this post, I just searched for info on the accident. Turns out the driver was 32 year old Mokhtar Mohammadi from Houston, Texas. A car hit the debris from the tractor trailer and a passenger was taken to a local hospital. It turns out Mohammadi was driving an over-height vehicle and damaged the overpass he tried to go under. He damaged the bridge badly, and the route that went over it had to be closed. He was ticketed at the scene. I'm wondering if this guy speaks and reads English because all along the thruway there are flashing signs alerting truck drivers about the height of the upcoming overpass and to make sure they can safely drive under it.

        "text_content": "Direct copy from Tweet (which includes videos and additional comments from the author) ---- Special thanks to @GoogleDeepMind for inviting me to try out Genie 3. I'm excited to share my thoughts on this early research prototype and also some of my live recordings below: I spent the whole day playing with the system and when it works, it is truly mind blowing\ud83e\udd2f. It is the first neural game engine / world model I have tried that generalizes so well and has long term world consistency. Here\u2019s a couple of examples from my live recording and some thoughts on what it means for the future of gaming, robotics, digital experiences and ASI. Where it shines: - Truly general-purpose and quick startup time. Works exceptionally well for gaming environments but also generalizes to other industrial and real-world scenarios. - It learns physics. Although there are systematic failures even for rigid body physics, it was clear to me that it can learn game engine and non-rigid physics without an underlying engine (and in limit learn from game engines via training data). - It works exceptionally well for stylized environments with characters walking around. This will have implications for concept artists, level designers and game devs. - It is way more fun than video models, indicating that there are high retention consumer experiences waiting to be built with this in the future - Photorealistic walk throughs and drone shots work exceptionally well - Global illumination and lighting works surprisingly well - Visual memory is quite powerful and the same objects approximately remain coherent under occlusion and longer time horizons Open Problems: - Physics is still hard and there are obvious failure cases when I tried the classical intuitive physics experiments from psychology (tower of blocks). - Social and multi-agent interactions are tricky to handle. 1vs1 combat games do not work - Long instruction following and simple combinatorial game logic fails (e.g. collect some points / keys etc, go to the door, unlock and so on) - Action space is limited - It is far from being a real game engines and has a long way to go but this is a clear glimpse into the future. The Future: - It is impressive enough for me to have strong conviction that this is going to disrupt the gaming industry. It is super early days and there are a lot of failures but the writing is on the wall. Lots of challenging scientific, engineering and scaling problems to be solved but it is going to happen in the next 5 years. - This is the final piece before we get full AGI and now I think we are well on our way to truly solve it once something like this is scaled up. In many ways it is more ASI than AGI but this is a matter of definitions. The fidelity and generalizability will reach human-level and quickly surpass humans - People are going to combine this with 3D AI and LLMs to build AAA games.",

I assume integrating this into something like existing multi modal models is years away still, but giving the models an ability to reason not just with language but with something like this which becomes almost akin to an imagination or visualization seems like one of the big missing pieces right now",

        "text_content": "<p>It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve written a post here. I have recently been staying quiet and letting others carry the conversation, but some moments demand that we speak. This is one of those moments. I think many of us feel the same weight right now, and putting some of it into words may help us carry it or at least help me carry the weight I feel.</p> <p>Charlie\u2019s death hit me hard. I know it hit many of you the same way. Our lives crossed paths. Because of this place I have faced threats, anger and isolation. We all have crossed paths with his voice and his message, and when someone like him is taken from us, it isn\u2019t just another headline it feels personal. It forces us to look at our families, our lives, and to recognize how fragile it all is. What happened to him could have happened to any of us, and that truth is burdensome.</p> <p>Charlie was never about violence. He was about speaking, about engaging, about truth. He wanted peace. He wanted conversations, even when they were uncomfortable. He wanted people to think, to challenge, but not to hate. That\u2019s what made him effective, and that\u2019s why his loss hurts so deeply.</p> <p>In the days after his death, we\u2019ve seen the usual two sides, worldwide we have seen compassion and friends we didn't know we had, but many others (often who we knew about) with cruelty, bitterness, and mockery. To me, this points to something bigger going wrong in our country. We have a mental health crisis that\u2019s growing worse every year. People are isolated, families are broken, drugs and depression are everywhere, and anger has become a way of life. Too many people are drowning in hate because they don\u2019t know love, don\u2019t know God, and don\u2019t know how to deal with the pain inside them. And when these voices are amplified, when they\u2019re given platforms, they often become louder than the voices of peace and reason. That\u2019s why so many cheer death instead of life. That\u2019s why they call for violence instead of conversation. That\u2019s the reality we\u2019re facing, and it\u2019s not just a political issue, it\u2019s a human issue, a spiritual crisis, a challenge to our society. We have lost civics and civility. It has been abandoned by our schools, our neighbors and our society.</p> <p>Charlie warned us about this. He showed us that hate cannot drive out hate. It must be met with truth, with conversation, with faith, and with love. The people who mock, who rage, who act like our very existence is a problem they aren\u2019t strong. They\u2019re broken. And this fight isn\u2019t just political, it\u2019s spiritual. The world has become a place where anger feels normal and patience feels weak. But we know better. Love, conversation, and understanding have power.</p> <p>So what do we do now? For me, the answer is faith, family, and country. Faith first, because without God, we are drifting. God is our anchor when the world feels unstable, the compass that points us back to what\u2019s right, the light that helps us see even when darkness surrounds us. Family next, because the real work, the real impact, begins at home. Be present. Be patient. Hold your children and families closer. Give them slightly longer hugs. Show them extra patience and compassion when you feel downtrodden, when your fuse burns a little too long. Your anger isn\u2019t directed at them. They need your love most when the world feels darkest. Our children and families are the future of this country. If we teach them love, faith, and patience, we give them the tools to survive a world that often feels cruel and chaotic. And then country, because America is worth fighting for not with hate, not with blind rage, but with conviction, with service, and with a commitment to the values that built this nation. America is strongest when we put God first, keep faith at the center of our lives, and hold our communities together.</p> <p>Part of honoring Charlie is also taking responsibility as a community. This isn\u2019t just about individuals, it\u2019s about noticing the people around us who are struggling, reaching out to them, listening, offering support. Sometimes that means a quiet word. Sometimes it means helping someone get real help. If we can help even a few people before the darkness overwhelms them, then we\u2019ve made a difference. That\u2019s how we build resilience, and that\u2019s how we carry forward the lessons Charlie tried to teach.</p> <p>We also need spiritual courage. It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed by anger, frustration, or grief. It\u2019s easy to see the brokenness around us and wonder if our efforts matter. But they do. Every act of patience, every conversation that seeks understanding, every gesture of love and service, they ripple out. They matter. They build a foundation for others to follow. They push back, in small but real ways, against the hate and despair threatening our communities.</p> <p>Charlie may be gone, but his message isn\u2019t. His voice may be quiet now, but his work lives on in each of us. Every time we speak truth, every time we show patience, every time we hold our families close, and every time we put America first in how we live and lead, we carry his flame forward. That flame isn\u2019t about anger. It\u2019s about hope, strength, faith, and love. It\u2019s about choosing life over despair, conversation over conflict, and love over hatred.</p> <p>I am well aware of those of you who think &quot;war&quot; or &quot;violence&quot; is the only answer. I cannot speak to that, but I can pray that violence or war is not what our country faces. That outcome will not be won by anyone and our country, that we love, will cease to exist. I trust in Trump and God that the avenues of our future will awaken a new peace and understanding from those who lie and speak ill of us. Biden, antifa, the Democrats and biased liberal media are covered in Charlie's blood.</p> <p>So let\u2019s keep moving forward. With God. With family. With love for each other. With patience for the lost, compassion for the hurting, and courage in the face of challenges. With a commitment to strengthen our communities, protect our families, and address the mental health crisis that affects so many in silence. And with a love for America that never wavers.</p> <p>Je suis Charlie.</p>",

        "score": 388,
        "text_content": "First, I want to start with the positives: in handheld mode the image quality is very clean. It seems to match the native resolution of the screen and the image does not appear to have many sharp edges, so there may also be some form of anti-aliasing. However, that's pretty much where the positive ends. First, the framerate is only 30fps, and for a game that is 90% small rooms and corridors where nothing happens, it's surprising that they could not achieve an higher frame rate, especially with Steam Deck being capable of running the game at 60fps with ease. Looking at far more demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077 or Star Wars Outlaws, I'm convinced this could have least reached a locked 40fps. That said, 30fps would still be easily acceptable on turn based RPG with very simple movement option, if it wasn't for the biggest technical issue of this port: frame pacing. To keep it short: this games stutter pretty much at all times, in any kind of scenario. In combat, moving the camera around, standing still. The only difference I've noticed is how much it stutters, as it goes from 'infrequent' stutters to 'omnipresent' stutters. Even worse, this game seems to have almost no motion blur applied, meaning that not only the game feels stutter-y to play, it also looks very, very uneven, as if it was running at a much lower frame rate. I play in handheld mode with the console relatively close to my face, and after 20 minutes of sprinting in Tartarus (the game's dungeon), I had to stop playing because I started having unpleasant eye strain. If you have not played the free demo on the eShop, GVG released a video yesterday highlighting how the game runs: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_A-wUAfnts8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A-wUAfnts8) ATLUS, if you are reading this, please implement a proper frame cap in the game (and give us some option for motion blur). The game visually looks okay enough, but the frame pacing completely ruins the game. Or, if you can't fix this, at least provide an option for uncapped frame rate with VRR enabled in portable mode. Literally any other option would be better than releasing the game in this state.",

        "text_content": "This is funny. It's weird and it's silly and it's only going to be for a very small number of people, but it's mostly just a straight up hilarious thing to do. The Virtual Boy is arguably the most maligned, worst-selling, most embarassing misstep in Nintendo's history. The few games released for it (supposedly) aren't even very good. This is a fun, silly product for collectors and the curious to experience one of gaming's most memed about disasters. For the collectors, there's a $100 replica of the device; for the merely curious, there's a cardboard version for $25. I also don't see how they can stop people who don't have either device loading the games up and playing them on a regular screen if they feel like it. Basically, it's all a bit of silly fun aimed at a niche audience, and you don't need to get it if you don't want to. And yet, the reaction to it has been insane. People are up in arms about everything: the price, that you require NSO, that it's 'stealing a slot' from another console... And so many are *angry* about it all. It's an example of Nintendo's pure greed, of them shitting all over gamers, further evidence of the death of the old Nintendo we all knew and loved... But no it's not. This is absolutely classic Nintendo. Some weird, niche, out-of-left-field, announcement with an accompanying high priced plastic peripheral. This is what they've been doing their whole history - except that in this case, they're actually offering people an alternative at a quarter the price. I swear, if Nintendo had done the famous puppet skit today, the reaction wouldn't be, haha, that was funny, it would be people criticising the quality of the puppets, complaining that it stole time from announcements and dividing Reggie's salary by the time of the segment to calculate how much of 'our' money it wasted. I'm not saying publishers and manufacturers don't bear their share of the blame, but a big part of the reason so many people are so unhappy with modern gaming comes from gamers themselves and few things lay that bare more clearly than this announcement.",

        "score": 110,
        "text_content": "So after the Direct yesterday I went on the eShop to bookmark the games I was interested in and noticed that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade was only $40, which is unbelievably low for a game of that quality That made me think that it was some error where the wrong price was entered and it would be fixed the following day, but nope I just saw a post on X saying that the game really is $40. But I don't understand, is there a catch or something I don't know about the game? How are they charging so little even compared to developers of similar games like Star Wars Outlaws or Cyberpunk 2077? Is the game shorter than I think it's going to be? Is this basically a free to start game where I have to purchase the rest of the story later? Mind you, Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 are $39.99 each. I know it's a older game, but to anyone who's played the game can you explain this to me? Serious discussion only please",

If a task can be broken in many steps but each step has small errors, the errors compounds and the task that can be completed is relatively short (in number of steps). In the figure posted by OP, only GPT5 is able to solve very long tasks while the others go astray because their errors hurt their abilities after a while. In short most models cannot complete long task because their error rate cripple them even if their approach is correct. Thinking helps as the thinking process picks the best \"output\" so to speak that then contains less errors and thus the model can solve more steps. E: hmm. If I understand the test done there, practically they say: \"there is a dictionary of short words. Each word has a weight. Each step gives you a list of words. Pick the related weight and sum it to the existing. Keep the sum for the next step\". I am not sure whether LLMs without tools can reliably do basic math beside very often mentioned quantities. That is, if the quantity they need to sum is not that common in the training data, they may go astray just due to that. Hence the thinking can help a ton on this. I would rather prefer a test where the LLMs keep using text (say, a A1z26 cipher or the like to keep the result short and textual) so that they don't have to know how to do basic math computation if they don't have access to tools. E2: I am searching online if LLMs can reliably add numbers up to a certain number of digits without tools and the answer seems to be no. So while it is true that the benchmark is still somewhat valid, I wonder if it is rather a \"let's see which model can guess the number better\" once the sum is large enough. It would be different, and could be that the authors do it but I missed it, if they would verify that the model is indeed able to add the numbers when only one step is involved. If the model is able to add the numbers within one step but it is unable in many steps, then the benchmark is valid.",

Massive datasets and pretraining allowed LLMs to form low-fidelity representations of human thought/cognitive processing. The same is theoretically possible for mathematical reasoning. Math is generally understood to build robust logic and reasoning in people. I don't see why this wouldn't translate to LLMs through massive pretraining on proof datasets and further reinforcement learning on proof based math tasks at scale.",

Recently, multimodal approaches that integrate various modalities such as speech, text, and physiological signals have gained attention for emotion estimation. However, the application of emotion recognition (ER) technology in clinical settings has not been thoroughly explored, particularly in terms of utilizing non-contact measurement techniques to reduce patient burden. Furthermore, there is limited research on quantitatively evaluating physicians\u2019 ER abilities and comparing them with existing ER methods. This study aims to propose a multimodal ER framework using non-contact measurement techniques and validate its effectiveness by comparing it with the emotion prediction accuracy of experienced physicians. The results demonstrated that the proposed non-contact multimodal approach outperformed physicians in ER accuracy. While physicians\u2019 empathetic abilities have traditionally been considered high, integrating multiple modalities was shown to surpass the recognition accuracy of unimodal approaches and human physicians. Moreover, the ability to obtain emotion-related data non-invasively enables advanced emotion estimation while reducing physical and psychological burdens on patients, highlighting the potential for clinical applications. These findings suggest a new method for supporting physicians\u2019 ER in clinical settings, offering a means to reduce the risk of fatigue associated with empathy.\"",

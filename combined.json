Some go for LPDDRx, but that kills expandability and capacity. This seems to solve all that and then some. It is effectively a speed doubler - it combines 2 sets of chips ( that would complete ordinary UDIMM stick) in a \"RAID0\" way - it interlieves them. Special high-speed \"register\" chip on M/C/RDIMM takes care of all that: unloading the data lines for optimal transfer speed, doubling the speed over the bus, registering and de/multiplexing data stream and serving TWO banks of RAM. BTW, 12.800MHz is just the start. This thing is poised to reach much higher. 18000 MHz wouldn't surprise me. Looks like win-win-win-win all around. Only downside is that de/multipexer/register introduces extra 1 CLK latency. But at DDR5's existing latencies, that is going to be negligagble, I reckon. It'd be so awesome if we could see AMD's APUs using this. Along with 3D cache on UDNA1, that extra bandwidth would make whole thing shine brightly not only for gaming and CAD, AI would benefit from it, too.

The *best* case for Intel's P-core is that its perf/watt is as good as the X925 and Oryon-L. I think it is likely much, much worse. According to Geekerwan, at a package power of \\~5 watts, the M3 performs \\~40% better than LNL. At around \\~7-8 watts, the M4 performs closer to \\~50% better. Meanwhile we have David Huang showing that a M4 Pro at \\~3.7 watts per core scoring \\~33% better than a 9950x, and the 9950x has an outright better curve than the 265K LNC. The gap is no where near as large compared to Apple's cores and the other ARM cores in the mobile space. Power is, IMO, by far the hardest to really quantify, because one has to deal with how to measure \"core only power\" while trying to isolate the power of the rest of the SOC. Then there's also the problem of software measurements vs hardware measurements... I imagine only engineers at their respective companies would really know the power draw of a specific core. **Core Overview** Apple seems to have the best N3 cores in both perf and power. The **M4's P-core** is pretty large by any standard, however it saves a bit of area due to it's cache hierarchy, making a hypothetical 4x CCX not that large. The shared L2 cache really only seems to be present in client mobile systems though so far, and I think it presents its own challenges in server. All the chips that use this hierarchy (Qcomm and Apple) both have very high mem bandwidth per core, which could be an issue scaling it up to server. The cache-per-core capacity, when all the cores are running and competing for the shared cache, would be lower than the competition. The **M3's and ARL's P-cores** have pretty much the same perf, and similar area, however the M3 P-core is almost certainly dramatically more power efficient than a LNC P-core. Additionally, in terms of CCX area, LNC ends up being way, way larger thanks to the different cache hierarchy. **Zen 5** dense is pretty interesting, as I really, really doubt it's Fmax only goes up to 3.7GHz. Performance is an unknown, as is power, however from purely an area perspective, it seems pretty comparable to the ARM P-cores. Meaning to get comparable performance to those cores, Zen 5C would have to have an Fmax of \\~4.7GHz, a 30% boost from what it clocks in server parts. Which... I mean isn't extremely unexpected ig considering that a similar percent boost was seen with Zen 4 dense in server and OC'd Zen 4, however it still seems pretty hard to believe. To be fair to the x86 cores though, they have 256/512 bit vector width, unlike the ARM cores listed only having 128 bit vector width. This does really seem to cost a decent bit of area, especially for Zen 5. AFAIK, Zen5C in server has the full Zen 5 AVX-512 implementation, and we have already seen how much area can be shaved off Zen 5 from just choosing not to go for the full AVX-512 implementation: |Core|Core| |:-|:-| |Zen 5 DT (N4P)|4.46 (+12%)| |Zen 5 MBL (N4P)|3.99| **Qualcomm's custom cores** honestly don't seem like they afford any sort of distinct advantage over ARM's stock cores on N3 (being implemented by different companies). Perhaps I am missing something, but there seems to be no meaningful area advantage (even considering the larger cache capacity), and no meaningful performance or power advantage. I also think Qualcomm's cache hierarchy transferring over to server, unchanged, would be pretty unique in the server space, seeing how no other major or even relatively smaller companies seem to be offering that sort of setup in servers. Maybe Qualcomm's P-cores would scale up at higher power better than ARM's cores in a laptop/desktop form factor? It is interesting to see Qualcomm choosing to presumably sacrifice IPC for greater clocks vs the stock ARM cores, perhaps they think perf at even more power would be greater, or maybe Vmin is lower? It's wild to see Mediatek's **X925** both end up being larger and slower than Xiaomi's implementation. No idea why or how. In terms of the comparison to the rest of the cores though, they aren't nearly as powerful as the rest of the P-cores, but they are also a decent bit smaller than the other P-cores as well. The lower performance may as well be due to the fact that they are all in a phone form factor, so it might be pretty interesting to see how the X925 in Nvidia's upcoming DG10 chip performs.",

Just happy switch 2 seems to run a ton of current games. 40fps performances modes would be ideal like with apparently this and cyberpunk if the game is wayy too demanding for 60fps but unfortunately most ports yet don't have settings like those. And yea 60fps seems almost impossible for any recently released AAA particularly the super ambitious open world ones which is fair enough.

Sufficient to experience the game completely, including the post-game in full. It took 50 hours in total. The game is one of the most incredible experiences that I have ever had. This is once again Nintendo at its finest. I am so glad that Super Mario Odyssey team tried to do something different and they truly delivered a masterpiece. The end game is a true delight. One of the greatest final levels ever done in a 3D game by Nintendo, and some of the greatest twists that you cannot see coming. I feel truly sorry for those for whom this game was spoiled. To experience the end game without being spoiled was one of the major highlights for me. It was shocking and delightful at the same time, on multiple occasions. The game was not easy. At the end it was quite challenging, and you need to play truly smart. Nintendo outdid themselves in the endgame and created a truly difficult final level and boss fight after a long time. It was truly satisfying to finish the game. The game is different. Really different from normal platformers. Personally, I enjoy run and jump type platformers more, and would rate Odyssey higher than Bananza. It took a little bit of time before this game clicked for me, but once it clicked there was no going back. It is one of the finest games ever made by Nintendo. It was such a pleasure to experience it. I cried at the end. The ending was so beautiful that crying was natural. It was worth it! Thank you Nintendo for creating this masterpiece.",

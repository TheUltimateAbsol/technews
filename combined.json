Metriod prime 4 enjoing a good amout looks amazing soundtrack is nice and this is my first metriod has i tend to hate fps has I just dont like first person camera view and perfer 3rd person always. But people where right in that its more of adventure/puzzles than a shooter atmosphere is solid to. Being my first game in the franchise and not the type of game i really play i am getting stuck at times going much slower than most people are probably going. Mario kart world open world is just chilling and relaxing game has a lot to do gets to much hate. Fast fusion i have to need to play more. Getting new content for kirby and the forgotten land was cool has the regular game was good and some more content that is basically like buying a 20 dlc i have no problem with. Backwards compatibility is good i know there are some games people would like to get patches that have not the 2 that come to my mind are luguis mansion 3 and Zelda SS HD just thanking give us 4k. But i have replayed bowsers furry, mario odyssey and they look a lot better than before. I started replaying zelda echos of wisdom looks great. Only played a little bit more of splatoon 3 but it looks unbelievable more clear than before. Having a spin off splatoon announced is cool hopefully we get a release date announced for that in a feb direct. Between metriod prime 4, mario kart world, DK bananza, kirby forgotten land dlc and replaying games that have been patched/switch 1 backlog there is already a lot to play.

        "text_content": "Very interesting snippets from this interview. Overview by Gemini 3: https://youtu.be/tDSDR7QILLg?si=UUK3TgJCgBI1Wrxg >Hassabis explains that DeepMind originally had \"many irons in the fire,\" including pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) and neuroscience-inspired architectures [00:20:17]. He admits that initially, they weren't sure which path would lead to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). >Scientific Agnosticism: Hassabis emphasizes that as a scientist, \"you can't get too dogmatic about some idea you have\" [00:20:06]. You must follow the empirical evidence. >The Turning Point: The decision to go \"all-in\" on scaling (and Large Language Models) happened simply because they \"started seeing the beginnings of scaling working\" [00:21:08]. Once the empirical data showed that scaling was delivering results, he pragmatically shifted more resources to that \"branch of the research tree\" [00:21:15]. >This is perhaps his most critical point. When explicitly asked if scaling existing LLMs is enough to reach AGI, or if a new approach is needed [00:23:05], Hassabis offers a two-part answer: >The \"Maximum\" Mandate: We must push scaling to the absolute maximum [00:23:11]. >Reasoning: At the very minimum, scaling will be a \"key component\" of the final AGI system. >Possibility: *He admits there is a chance scaling \"could be the entirety of the AGI system\"* [00:23:23], though he views this as less likely. >The \"Breakthrough\" Hypothesis: His \"best guess\" is that scaling alone will not be enough. He predicts that \"one or two more big breakthroughs\" are still required [00:23:27]. >He suspects that when we look back at AGI, we will see that scaling was the engine, but these specific breakthroughs were necessary to cross the finish line [00:23:45]. Other noteworthy mentions from the interview: >AI might solve major societal issues like clean energy (fusion, batteries), disease, and material science, leading to a \"post-scarcity\" era where humanity flourishes and explores the stars [08:55]. >Current Standing: The US and the West are currently in the lead, but China is not far behind (months, not years) [13:33]. >Innovation Gap: While China is excellent at \"fast following\" and scaling, Hassabis argues the West still holds the edge in algorithmic innovation\u2014creating entirely new paradigms rather than just optimizing existing ones [13:46]. >Video Understanding: Hassabis believes the most under-appreciated capability is Gemini's ability to \"watch\" a video and answer conceptual questions about it. Example: He cites asking Gemini about a scene in Fight Club (where a character removes a ring). The model provided a meta-analytical answer about the symbolism of leaving everyday life behind, rather than just describing the visual action [15:20]. >One-Shotting Games: The model can now generate playable games/code from high-level prompts (\"vibe coding\") in hours, a task that used to take years [17:31]. >Hassabis estimates AGI is 5 to 10 years away [21:44]. Interesting how different the perspectives are between Dario, Hassabis, Ilya: Dario: Country of Geniuses within a datacenter is 2 years away and scaling alone with minor tweaks is all we need for AGI. Ilya: ASI 5-20 years away and scaling alone cannot get us to AGI. Hassabis: AGI 5 to 10 years away, scaling alone could lead to AGI but likely need 1 or 2 major breakthroughs.",

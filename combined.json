        "text_content": "CAMM memory modules are closer to the CPU, and have shorter traces than both DIMMs and the SODIMMs they were originally designed to replace, meaning both lower power and lower latency. While the most obvious and the main intended advantage CAMM has over SODIMMs is being in a small form-factor, and power efficiency, which is most important for mobile devices. Lower latency matters for desktop and servers too, doesn't it? So, wouldn't going with the option with the lowest latency be the ideal? Obviously, the absolute lowest latency is something integrated on-package, like an X3D, or 2.5D HBM solution or ESRAM or EDRAM, but desktops, workstations and servers often need upgradeability and configurability. But CAMM provides both that modular functionality with lower latency compared to the traditional DIMM slot standard and form factor. I understand that it's newer and more expensive for now, but. Is it likely that at some point, say for DDR6 motherboards, that CAMM modules will replace DIMM slots?",

Intel all but directly said they won't bother building out 14A if they can't get external customers. So realistically, 14A, or at best maybe the node after that, is where Intel *needs* to get whale customers and deals for their nodes, otherwise significant structural changes would have to be made. I also want to point out, this article claims that 14A seemingly has better reception than 18A, but their justification of it - multiple customers expressed interest- is *exactly* what happened with 18A too.

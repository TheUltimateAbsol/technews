Most people don't even know what they are missing out on, as they aren't even working with instruction sets, so they have no idea how dated AVX2 is, and how AVX512 isn't just wider, but also more flexible. I'm at the point where I won't even consider the next Intel CPU generation if it still doesn't support AVX512 as an embarrassing regression since Rocket Lake and early Alder Lake. Zen4 just raised the bar too high, and Zen5 is just so crazy with AVX512, the rest of the system can't even keep up with it, making me look forward to Zen6 with hopefully an improved I/O die and IFoP improvements getting paired with it.",

To address this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step towards accelerating scientific progress. Pretty interesting. I wonder if it can be applied to model training.",

Love this quote as it shows there is hope for improvement: >Its 2-body form suggests why LLMs work so well, but hints that a generalized 3-body Attention would make such AI work even better. Its similarity to a spin-bath means that existing Physics expertise could immediately be harnessed to help Society ensure AI is trustworthy and resilient to manipulation.",

It is 100% a productivity boost, especially in white collar work, including high skill professions like software engineering My question is this - why is this additional value not showing up somewhere? It's entirely possible that I'm not looking in the right places, but we should have had a lot more displacement by now Even the largest layoffs in tech companies have been limited to 5-10% of their workforce. People are still landing jobs. Hiring has slowed sure, but not by much at all So is the tech not there yet? Is it missing some secret sauce like long context, constant learning etc etc? I just don't see why a senior software engineer with the right tools couldn't lead to a layoff of 50% of the junior devs. Are companies slow and cautious to adapt? Are they afraid of a backlash from the government?",

Here, we present a fully soft neural interface incorporating a thermo-pneumatic peristaltic micropump integrated with asymmetrically tapered microchannels for targeted, on-demand wireless drug delivery. All structural and functional components are fabricated from soft materials, ensuring mechanical compatibility with brain tissue. The system employs sequential actuation of microheaters to generate unidirectional airflow that drives drug infusion from an on-board reservoir. The nozzle\u2013diffuser geometry of the microchannels minimizes backflow while enabling controlled, continuous delivery without mechanical valves. Fluid dynamics simulations guided the optimization of the microfluidic design, resulting in robust forward flow with minimal reflux. Benchtop validation in brain-mimicking phantoms confirmed consistent and programmable drug infusion. This platform represents a significant advancement in neuropharmacological research and therapeutic delivery for central nervous system disorders.\"",

It all comes back to that Google paper \"We Have No Moat, And Neither Does OpenAI\". They're trying to make bigness the moat even if most of it empty promises. But the US doesn't have the productive capacity or capital to do that forever (datacenters never actually getting built, GPUs sitting unused in warehouses). And if Chinese models stay a few months behind they're always going to be a threat. They just have to outlast us because there's no way the US is going to build 250 gigawatts of datacenters in the next eight years.",

They are also quite tanky and the loot they drop is underwhelming - Another one is the anti-cheat, they're using Battle Eye and not a kernel-level solution yet which may be frustrating when you can lose your gear. Chinese regional pricing was another concern as that's not been announced yet. - PC performance is supposedly solid and has improved quite a bit from the previous test, which might change if they decide to push the graphics more before launch. No raytracing effects and no frame generation yet. Images: https://ibb.co/album/HX5Nmr",

        "score": 0,
        "text_content": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-12-22/affordable-housing-in-the-south-is-slowly-coming-back Here in Atlanta, as in much of the American South, the economic vibes have been bad this year. Not recessionary perhaps, it\u2019s felt more like we lost momentum and got stuck, something I haven\u2019t experienced since I moved here from San Francisco in 2010. I\u2019m not optimistic for the first half of next year, but one silver lining in the South\u2019s economic struggles is the grind back toward housing affordability, which should put the region on the path back to a more balanced expansion. The economic model of many southern states relies on attracting people and jobs from pricey coastal regions and the Midwest. Relatively cheap housing draws the young, and the demand for residential and non-residential construction to service relocating families creates a virtuous cycle that\u2019s served the South well. This engine has been sputtering ever since the Federal Reserve ratcheted up interest rates in 2022, with conditions feeling particularly bleak right now. From Maryland to Florida and Texas, companies have been hiring at a rate similar to the first few years following the 2008 financial crisis. The most recent Beige Book report, which provides qualitative information about the economy from the Fed\u2019s 12 regional districts, noted flat employment and growing stress among low-to-moderate-income consumers in the Atlanta district, which encompasses most of the Southeast, and weak economic activity and employment declines in the Dallas district, which covers all of Texas. Consider Atlanta, where the general lack of interstate migration and housing turnover in recent years has led to less demand for both single-family homes and apartments. This has hit not just workers in the construction industry but also employees in allied fields from real estate and mortgage agents to those in the home improvement business. It has hurt Home Depot Inc., which is headquartered in metro Atlanta and is a large employer in the region. The spillover effects from the goods economy \u2014 also grappling with President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 has hurt the business of another key employer headquartered in the region, United Parcel Service Inc., which cut 34,000 jobs this year. The surge in Black unemployment over the past several months is also weighing on the metro, whose population is one-third Black or African-American, according to the Metro Atlanta Chamber. What Atlanta and other metros in states including Florida and Texas need is migration and residential construction to pick up again. But for that to happen, housing affordability needs to improve. Fortunately, it has been. According to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller Indices, in the 12 months ending in September, home prices were down 4.1% in Tampa, 2% in Phoenix, 1.3% in Dallas, and 0.2% in Atlanta. Over that same period, average hourly earnings in those metros have grown by 4% or more. With resale housing inventory above 2019 levels in all those cities, and rising, affordability should improve at a solid pace in 2026. Housing transactions are already showing early signs of life, with mortgage purchase applications now in a clear uptrend. Single- and multi-family building starts will stay sluggish for some time, though the data-center boom has provided some respite, preventing a more pronounced downturn in construction employment. Most importantly, relative affordability gaps are again growing between southern and northern metros, pointing to a pickup in interstate migration that should start to stabilize the southern economies in the latter part of next year. It will also help chip away at the north\u2019s affordability challenges. Northern metros such as Hartford, Connecticut, and Chicago struggle to offer residents cheaper housing due to low supply. These places need to build more and remove regulatory obstacles to construction, but we should also be realistic in acknowledging that Hartford and Chicago will never build houses like the sprawling metros of the South, which have more undeveloped land as well as a robust residential construction ecosystem. On some level, fixing affordability in the North involves getting interstate migration back to its historical trend. The chicken-and-egg dynamic of affordability drawing migration, which will pick up with greater affordability, means there\u2019s more economic pain to come in the South. The best we can hope for in 2026 is optimism on the horizon, even if we\u2019re probably in for another year of stagnation.",

In the future there will be LLM text-trained components integrated into generative AI to help guide the logic of the generation directly in latent space and through reasoning over the outputs. Nano Banana Pro is already doing this to a degree and that's why there's been such a drastic improvement in its ability to create logically consistent and plausible outputs, which Demis Hassabis refers to as \"synergy\". I haven't tried GPT Image 1.5 yet but I imagine it's the same deal. Where things will really take off is when multimodal LLM's begin to incorporate video generation and playback within the same unified architecture as the text reading/writing, rather than the current compute-saving modular designs where different components are stitched together and outsource various tasks to one another. Just imagine how much psychological and physical knowledge an LLM could acquire about the world from watching millions of hours of video in addition to reading virtually all of the text ever published to the general public and reasoning over all of it within a unified space. When reasoning over text, they'll be able to visualize how it all \"looks\" when played out as a visual scenario, and vice-versa when reasoning over video while incorporating vast bodies of knowledge acquired from text. Recent advances seem to strongly suggest that scaling model sizes, data and compute will continue leading to overall intelligence gains, but that even greater progress is being achieved by improvements in the ways the models are trained, yielding high levels of intelligence even in smaller models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. So when those millions of hours of YouTube videos start getting incorporated into world simulations and reinforcement learning tasks, look the frick out.",

        "text_content": "**MiniMax M2.1 officially launched today** and it is a massive disruptor for the **SOTA coding leaderboard.** Built specifically for agentic workflows and complex engineering, it is already showing frontier-level results. **The Performance Stats:** It scored a massive **72.5% on SWE-bench Multilingual** and **74.0% on SWE-bench Verified**, effectively beating both **Claude Sonnet 4.5** and **Gemini 3 Pro** in core technical benchmarks. **Language Mastery:** Unlike models that only prioritize Python, M2.1 is optimized for **Rust, Java, Go, C++, and JavaScript**. It handles multi-file engineering and compile-run-fix loops with high reliability. **Native AppDev Focus:** Major upgrades were included for **native Android and iOS development**. It also features improved web aesthetics and more realistic scientific simulations for technical workflows. **The Price Revolution:** This is the most important part for developers. Early testers report Claude level performance at **10% of the cost**. Input tokens are priced at just **$0.30 per million**, making heavy agentic loops affordable for everyone. **Open Source Timeline:** The full open-source release is scheduled for **December 25th**. We can expect weights and local deployment options to hit the community in just two days. **Official Source Links:** **Main Announcement:** https://www.minimax.io/news/minimax-m21 **Technical Docs:** https://platform.minimax.io/docs/guides/text-generation **Agent Portal:** https://agent.minimax.io/",

The only bit of the Unity UI I have touched is adding a single GameObject to the Scene and attaching scripts written entirely by Opus to it. The logic decisions (taste?) of the model is still off sometimes, but it has straight up succeeded at every task I've set it so far. From pathfinding to proc gen map building to some basic enemy AI. Last night I had two instances of Code running on two different git worktrees, implementing two large features in 10 minutes in parallel that would've taken me multiple hours. Now I know how to build this engine myself. It would've taken me a lot longer, but I know where the model has made a bad decision. But it still feels like a massive step up over previous models where Opus/CC will persevere in a loop with lots of tool calls and good use of context to meet the end goal that has been set. Watching it work is almost like watching another developer work in pure text form.",

Obviously one can\u2019t circumvent the no free lunch theorem so in a practical and finite system there always has to be some **degree of specialisation** around the target distribution that is being learnt. But the point about **generality** is that in theory, in the Turing Machine sense, the architecture of such a general system is **capable** of learning anything computable given enough time and memory (and data) and the human brain (and AI foundation models) are approximate Turing Machines. **Finally,** with regards to Yann's comments about chess players, it\u2019s amazing that humans could have invented chess in the first place (and all the other aspects of modern civilization from science to 747s!) let alone get as brilliant at it as someone like Magnus. He **may not** be strictly optimal (after all he has finite memory and limited time to make a decision) but it\u2019s incredible what he and we can do with our brains given they were evolved for hunter gathering. **Replied to this:** Yann LeCun **says** there is no such thing as general intelligence. Human intelligence is super-specialized for the physical world, and our feeling of generality is an illusion We only seem general because we can't imagine the problems we're blind to and **\"the concept is complete BS\"** **Sources:** 1) **Video of Yann Lecunn:** https://x.com/i/status/2000959102940291456 2) **Demis new Post:** https://x.com/i/status/2003097405026193809",

I think they\u2019re using the \u201cLater\u201d time card as a loading screen but because of that, it feels like cutscenes and transitions are bugged. Performance on Switch 2 is kinda mixed. The only times it stayed at 60 fps was in the Krusty Krab and at the hub world. When exploring the levels, the game struggles to keep a stable framerate. It was playable, but pretty inconsistent. It is a demo though and the framerate issues could be fixed at launch.",

                "raw_content": "S&P COTALITY CASE-SHILLER INDEX REPORTS ANNUAL GAIN IN AUGUST 2025 \u2022 The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index posted a 1.5% annual gain for August, down from a 1.6% rise in the previous month. \u2022 Housing wealth eroded in real terms for the fourth consecutive month, with the 1.5% national gain falling well short of 3% inflation. \u2022 Nineteen of 20 metros declined month-to-month in August, with only Chicago posting a gain, signaling broad weakness beyond typical seasonal patterns. ANALYSIS \"August's data shows U.S. home prices continuing to slow, with the National Index up just 1.5% yearover-year,\" said Nicholas Godec, CFA, CAIA, CIPM, Head of Fixed Income Tradables & Commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \"This marks the weakest annual gain in over two years and falls well below the 3% inflation rate. For the fourth straight month, home values have lost ground to inflation, meaning homeowners are seeing their real wealth decline even as nominal prices inch higher. \"The National Index rose 1.5% over the past year, with most of that gain coming in the recent six months (up 1.5%) while the prior six months were essentially flat. The 20-City Composite gained 1.6% annually and the 10-City rose 2.1%, both continuing their deceleration from earlier in the year.. \"New York again led all metros with a 6.1% annual gain, followed by Chicago at 5.9% and Cleveland at 4.7%. These Midwest and Northeast markets, which saw modest gains during the pandemic, continue to outperform. At the other end, Tampa fell 3.3% year over year, Phoenix dropped 1.7%, and Miami declined 1.7%. Several Western markets also posted losses: San Francisco fell 1.5%, Denver dropped 0.7%, and San Diego declined 0.7%. Seattle turned slightly negative at -0.1%.3\"Monthly data for August was weak across the board. Nineteen of 20 cities saw price declines before seasonal adjustment, with only Chicago posting a gain. The National Index fell 0.3% for the month, while both the 10-City and 20-City Composites dropped 0.6%. After seasonal adjustment, all three indices remained negative, suggesting weakness beyond normal seasonal patterns. Phoenix fell 0.9% in August alone, while Los Angeles, Portland, and Denver each dropped between 0.7% and 1.0%. \"Mortgage rates remaining above 6.5% continue to weigh on buyer demand, even during what should be the busy summer season. The combination of high financing costs and prices that remain near record highs has limited transaction activity. Markets that experienced the sharpest pandemic-era gains are now seeing the largest corrections, while more affordable metros with stable local economies are holding up better. Looking ahead, the housing market appears to be finding a new equilibrium after the pandemic boom,\" Godec concluded. \"With price growth running at half the rate of inflation and several major markets in decline, the rapid appreciation of recent years has clearly ended. This adjustment may ultimately lead to a more sustainable market, but for now, homeowners are watching their real equity erode while buyers face the dual challenge of elevated prices and high borrowing costs.\" YEAR-OVER-YEAR The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 1.5% annual gain for August, down from a 1.6% rise in the previous month. The 10-City Composite showed an annual increase of 2.1%, down from a 2.3% increase in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a year-over-year increase of 1.6%, down from a 1.8% increase in the previous month. New York again reported the highest annual gain among the 20 cities with a 6.1% increase in August, followed by Chicago and Cleveland with annual increases of 5.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Tampa posted the lowest return, falling 3.3%. The chart below compares year-over-year returns for different housing price ranges (tiers) in New York. MONTH-OVER-MONTH The pre-seasonally adjusted U.S. National, 10-City Composite, and 20-City Composite Indices continued to report negative month-over-month change in August, posting -0.3% for U.S. national index and -0.6% for both 10-City and 20-City Composite indices. After seasonal adjustment, all three indices posted a month-over-month increase of 0.2%. SUPPORTING DATA The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, which covers all nine U.S. census divisions, recorded a 1.5% annual increase in August 2025.

The typical home also sold in roughly 20 days\u2014over twice as fast as the typical U.S. home. The housing market in the San Francisco Bay Area is picking up steam thanks to rising incomes, an AI boom and a return to the office. Pending home sales in San Francisco jumped 17.1% year over year to the highest September level since 2021 last month. That\u2019s the biggest gain among the major metropolitan areas Redfin analyzed. Nationwide, pending sales rose less than 1%. Homes in the Bay Area also sold quickly: In San Jose, the typical home that went under contract last month did so in 19 days, faster than any other major metro. San Francisco came in second place, at 21 days\u2014its quickest September pace since 2021. San Francisco is one of just three major U.S. metros that saw homes sell faster than a year earlier in September. Nationwide, the typical home that went under contract sat on the market for 50 days. In San Jose, nearly half (48.5%) of homes that went under contract in September did so within just two weeks, up from 16.8% a year earlier. That 31.7-percentage-point gain is the largest of any major metro. The next biggest gains were in San Francisco (+22.6 ppts to 48.7%) and Oakland (+11.9 ppts to 34.5%). Nationwide, just 32.8% of homes that went under contract last month did so within two weeks, and that\u2019s down from 34.9% a year earlier. Redfin analyzed the 50 most populous metros. For pending sales, we analyzed 47 of the 50 most populous metros\u2014those with sufficient data. There are a few reasons the Bay Area\u2019s housing market is heating up: Affordability is improving: The Bay Area remains the most expensive place to buy a home in the nation, with median sale prices of around $1.5 million in both San Francisco and San Jose. But it is also home to many affluent workers who have watched their incomes grow and home prices stagnate. That has boosted homebuyer demand. Oakland\u2019s median home sale price dropped 1.3% year over year in September\u2014the fourth biggest decline among the metros Redfin analyzed. San Francisco also saw prices fall slightly, posting a 0.7% drop. That compares with a nationwide gain of 1.7%. San Jose did buck the Bay Area trend, with a price gain of 6.9%. A drop in condo prices may be skewing overall prices downward in some parts of the Bay Area, according to local Redfin Premier real estate agent Ali Mafi, who noted that single-family home prices have held up relatively well. \u201cSan Francisco is seeing a homebuying boom among young tech workers who just got big signing bonuses with AI companies or other tech companies and are thinking about starting families,\u201d Mafi said. \u201cA lot of people have more confidence in buying homes because they\u2019re making more money, which means they\u2019re spending less of their paycheck on housing costs.\u201d Mortgage rates have also fallen to around 6.2% from a peak of nearly 7% at the start of the year. While that has yet to boost buyer demand in a big way nationally, it has brought buyers off of the sidelines in the Bay Area. \u201cWhen you live in a place where a desirable, move-in ready home often costs $2 million, a half-percentage-point drop in mortgage rates can dramatically lower your monthly housing payment,\u201d Mafi said. The AI boom and return to office: Silicon Valley is home to numerous major AI companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which have been hiring scores of workers and offering generous pay packages. Many companies are also requiring workers to return to the office, prompting more people to move into or near the city. San Francisco office visits jumped 19% year over year in September, the largest increase among markets analyzed by Placer.ai. Supply is shrinking: Active listings of homes for sale fell in just two major metros last month: San Francisco (-7.7% year over year) and San Jose (-6%). The combination of increasing demand and decreasing supply can cause a market to heat up because it often means buyers are competing for homes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a ton of homes for sale in the Bay Area because many prospective sellers here can afford to wait until the price is right,\u201d Mafi said. \u201cA lot of homeowners are considering selling but holding off until home prices go up and mortgage rates drop further.\u201d In most U.S. housing markets, buyers hold the negotiating power because they are outnumbered by sellers. But this dynamic seems to be on its way out in San Francisco. Nationwide, there were an estimated 36.7% more home sellers than buyers in the market last month\u2014a near-record gap. But in San Francisco, there were only 10.2% more sellers than buyers, and that\u2019s down from a peak of 47.1% in May.",

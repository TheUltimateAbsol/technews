        "score": 83,
        "text_content": "I have seen a lot of people complain that the Switch 2 has a \"lack of big first-party exclusives\". I have also seen people dismiss Pokemon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 because \"those are Switch 1 games, therefore they don't count\". I think these complaints actually show one of the main challenges Nintendo are facing with the Switch 2: the lack of Wii U ports to rely on. The failure of the Wii U actually was GREAT for the Switch's early years, particularly 2017/2018. Every Wii U game could be sold as a \"new exclusive Switch game\" to the vast majority of the audience. If you remove all the Wii U games, Switch 2 Editions and \"cross-gen\" games, then the first year exclusives for the Switch and Switch 2 are actually pretty similar to each other. The first 12 months of the Switch 1: \\- 1-2 Switch \\- ARMS \\- Splatoon 2 \\- Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle \\- Super Mario Odyssey \\- Xenoblade Chronicles 2 The first 12 months of the Switch 2: \\- Mario Kart World \\- Donkey Kong Bananza \\- Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment \\- Kirby Air Riders \\- Mario Tennis Fever \\- Yoshi and the Mysterious Book If you add the games that were non-exclusives, then the Switch has BOTW and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, while the Switch 2 has Pokemon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4. TL;DR: The Switch 2 actually has about the same number of first-party exclusives as the Switch 1 in the first 12 months. But this feels different for most people because they did not own a Wii U, and thus saw Wii U games as being equivalent to brand new exclusives like Mario Odyssey. Cross-gen games like Metroid Prime 4 are criticised more now because almost everyone who is considering a Switch 2 already owns a Switch 1.",

In Q2 2025 alone, they sold 5,800 homes and only bought 4,069. The report suggests they are pivoting from buying existing homes to financing new build-to-rent developments, adding supply rather than competing for it. This raises a question: Are policies aimed at curbing institutional buying targeting the right group? It seems the vast majority of investor-owners are small-scale, local players. **Source:** BatchData Q2 2025 Investor Pulse Report: [`https://batchdata.io/investor-pulse-q2-2025`](https://batchdata.io/investor-pulse-q2-2025)",

After strengthening in the first half of this year, single-family home rents began to slow in July. This could be a sign that as the consumer struggles, landlords are going to have to move to meet them. Single-family rent prices in July increased 2.3% from the same month last year, which is slower than the 3.1% average increase a year ago, according to the latest data from Cotality. Rent growth has now fallen below the lower end of the 10-year average range of pre-pandemic growth. \u201cAfter a strong start to the year, single-family rent growth is clearly losing steam,\u201d said Molly Boesel, senior principal economist at Cotality. \u201cIn July, we broadly saw weakening in annual single-family rent growth across metro areas and price tiers.\u201d Rent growth was just 0.2% higher in July compared with June, which is far below the historical July average monthly growth of 0.7%. That is a notable shift from monthly gains that had been stronger than usual earlier this year. \u201cEven markets like Los Angeles, which had been buoyed by post-wildfire demand, are now cooling off. Chicago stands out as the exception, leading the nation in rent growth amid tight inventory and resilient demand,\u201d said Boesel. Looking just at the 10 largest metropolitan markets, Chicago was in the lead at 5.1% rent growth, and the New York City metropolitan area came in second at 3.7% growth. Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., followed, and while Los Angeles is slowing, it still rounds out the top five for rent growth. Dallas and Miami were the lowest of the 10, with Miami seeing no rent growth at all. Compare that to 2022, when pandemic-driven migration to the Suth caused Miami\u2019s annual rent growth to soar 40%. Rent growth also weakened at all price points. For high-end properties, national average rents increased 2.9% from a year ago, down from the 3.2% annual gain seen last July. The same trend was seen in low-end rents, which increased 1.6% annually in July, down from the 2.8% gain in July 2024. Single-family rents had been doing much better than apartment rents over the last few years, as an enormous amount of supply came on the multifamily market. Single-family rentals were also in high demand due to the skyrocketing prices in the for-sale market. Families, which tend to be buyers, were opting for rental homes in good school districts instead. Single-family rental REITs, like Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent, have actually been building more rental communities just to keep up with that demand, so it will be interesting to see if this latest weakening causes them to pull back. As Property Play noted in July, the largest single-family rental REITs were selling more homes than they were buying, according to a count by Parcl Labs. That, however, was because they were trying to consolidate away from standalone properties and more into full rental communities, some of which they were building.",

U.S. home prices rose 0.2% from a month earlier in August on a seasonally adjusted basis, up slightly from the 0.0% monthly growth rate posted in July. August marks the first time since January that the rate of home-price growth increased compared to the prior month. On a year-over-year basis, home-price growth slowed to 3.1%, the lowest rate recorded in Redfin Home Price Index (RHPI) data going back to 2012. This is according to the Redfin Home Price Index (RHPI), which uses the repeat-sales pricing method to calculate seasonally adjusted changes in prices of single-family homes. The RHPI measures sale prices of homes that sold during a given period, and how those prices have changed since the last time those same homes sold. It\u2019s similar to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, but is a month ahead. August data covers the three months ending August 31, 2025. Read the full RHPI methodology here. Home price growth slowed this year as inventory returned to pre-pandemic levels, while would-be homebuyers remained on the sidelines due to near-record prices, elevated rates and economic uncertainty. With buyer demand remaining low, sellers also recently started backing off; the number of sellers declined in July for the first time in two years. \u201cThe tug-of-war in today\u2019s housing market may actually be creating an opening for both buyers and sellers,\u201d said Redfin Senior Economist Sheharyar Bokhari. \u201cWith more inventory available, intense bidding wars are in the rearview mirror, so buyers have room to negotiate. At the same time, sellers who price their homes realistically are still finding buyers, and overall, prices are holding steady. This middle ground could leave a window of opportunity open for both sides.\u201d Metro-Level Summary: Redfin Home Price Index, August 2025 Home prices fell in 26 of the 50 most populous U.S. metro areas on a seasonally adjusted basis in August, month over month. The biggest decline in August was in San Diego (-1.4%), followed by Los Angeles (-1.1%) and Fort Lauderdale, FL (-1%). Prices increased most in San Francisco (1.5% month over month), Philadelphia (1.5%) and Charlotte (0.8%). On a year-over-year basis, prices in New York (11%) rose the most, followed by Nassau County, NY (8.9%) and Newark, NJ (8.6%). Prices fell the most in Austin, TX (-3.7% year over year), Tampa, FL (-3.5%), and Oakland, CA (-2.1%).",

In *Together*, the thriller starring Dave Franco and Alison Brie, one of the men in a same-sex relationship was replaced with a woman\u2019s face. The edit sparked backlash from viewers, many of whom only noticed after social media posts compared the altered scene with the original.",

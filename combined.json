        "text_content": "Credits to Techpowerup for full HD slides This is quite surprising as previously it sits on SoC tile (Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake) but also hardly surprising as this is pretty much Lunar Lake layout, which the media engine also has access to 6MB side cache. If this compute tile is inherited by Nova Lake, this begs the question if we will get real F SKU, as in no IGP but still has display and media acceleration. Lost 1 media engine though, like Lunar Lake. I'm curious with that Sony codec though, is the userbase that high to license it from Sony?",

                "raw_content": "To clear a few things up: It's on the compute tile because Intel essentially made the SoC tile redundant for Lunar and Panther Lake. What would be its job is now done on the compute and maybe I/O tiles. Memory controllers for example are now on the compute tile. This compute tile is likely not inherited by NVL. Nova Lake uses different cores as far as we know. Panther Lake uses Cougar Cove P-cores and Darkmont E-cores. Nova Lake is currently reported to use Coyote Cove P-cores and Artic Wolf E-cores. Diamond Rapids is reportedly using Panther Cove. This is probably a Golden/Raptor/Redwood Cove situation again, but those cores are in fact different architectures. You can't make a 14600K out of a 185H or a 13700K out of a 12900K for example. So no, I don't think this will be a problem for Nova Lake, since it probably can't use this compute tile. Also, having the media engine on a separate tile from the GPU doesn't really matter. The operating system will still see them as one thing so to speak. It's been fine since Meteor Lake and continues to have the advantage of being able to only run the bulk GPU for short bursts during playback. As for how that works with an F SKU, they would likely simply disable the media engines as well, just like disabling a selection of cores or cache for segmentation.",

        "text_content": "I watched a video about the current state of AI recently, by kurzgesagt if your curious. And I realized something as soon as I heard a specific quote from it. I realized that I think the entire way were thinking about AI's effect on the internet, is wrong. It was a warning about what AI will do to social media. \"Stuff just good enough, will soak up the majority of human attention. It could make us dumber, less informed, our attention spans even worse, increase political divides, and make us neglect real human attention.\" This is talking about AI's effect on social media, even though you could apply everything here to current social media. And it would fit perfectly. AI is not causing any of this, it's just making it more obvious. So I would like in this post to address all these issues, point out how they're affected by AI, and really, how social media is already causing them. \"Stuff just good enough, will soak up the majority of human intention.\": This is exclusively the fault of social media. The algorithms that sort what is shown to us, do not care about quality. They care about what we will watch, and how long we will watch it. A hundred shitty but long videos or posts, is far better for the algorithm than one very well made video or post, because the goal of every social media company is to keep people on their site, so they can sell ads. AI only makes this worse because it makes it easier to make low effort content, but if low effort content wasn't prioritized in the first place, then that wouldn't be an issue in the first place. \"It could make us dumber, and less informed.\": This is partly the fault of AI and its current design. The video by kurzgesagt goes into a lot of detail about this, AI is not good at being factual, and is very good at making shit up that sounds about right. But, again, this issue would be heavily mitigated if social media was designed to prioritize truth, which it doesn't. Social media is the most incredible misinformation machine imaginable, that even if AI dedicated itself to exclusively create misinformation, they couldn't hold a candle to what social media already does on a daily basis. Social media is optimized for attention, and one of the best ways to keep someone's attention is a story, especially when it confirms their beliefs. And especially when you pretend it actually happened. You don't need AI to do this, only an algorithm that makes doing it profitable. Because why automate when you can crowdsource? \"it could make our attention spans even worse.\": This one, I'm not sure about. There's conflicting data on whether social media, AI, TV, games, even books if you go way back, lower our attention spans or if we just get better at quickly absorbing information. This is mostly outside of the scope of this post though, so I'm just going to leave it at I don't know. \"It could increase political divides.\": Oh man does AI have nothing on social media here. I could talk about this for hours, so I'll try to be brief. There is nothing that has had a worse effect on American politics, than social media. Social media has annihilated American politics, and created two opposed cults that we call political sides. Social media is an echo chamber machine, and that plus the misinformation machine, is quite the nasty combo. It brings people together who all believe the same thing, encourages those beliefs, correct or not, with false information and emotionally manipulative propaganda, and allows them to only engage in the other side when they want to mock them or scream at them. Because of how the internet works, every chat board, every subreddit, every discord server is like an island that only you and the people you agree with live on. You don't have to be around people that challenge your beliefs, you don't have to deal with information that goes against your beliefs, because the algorithm will simply filter those out. Or just give you the worst of the other side to piss you off. AI makes this worse by allowing sides to create propaganda easier, much easier for sure, but again, this wouldn't be nearly as much of a problem if the algorithm didn't optimize for it. \"It could make us neglect human attention.\": While this one is diffidently made worse by social media, really, I think this is a problem we all have a responsibility for. The world is horrible, and people are horrible, and we do not make it easy to want to be around each other. Many people are lonely, and don't have deep connections. AI is a very tempting solution to people who are lonely. AI will not judge you, not talk over you, not burden you. This is incredibly valuable for lonely broken people, and I don't want to discount the healing effect this can have, but it can't be a final solution. AI does not care about you, and can't really connect to you, and that matters. Real meaningful connection involves someone choosing to spend time with you, out of love, and that will always be more valuable. I don't know how to solve this really, but I do know that social media in its current form, is making the problem worse. There's a theory called the dead internet theory, that most seemingly human interaction on the internet, is really generated by bots. I believe this is actually quite correct, but the bots aren't AI, there us. We are given points by doing what the algorithm wants us to do, attention, likes, comments, love. This trains us to do what the algorithm wants. To say what it wants us to say. To keep feeding into it, to pull others deeper. This is strikingly similar to how machine learning works, reinforcement learning isn't bound to silicon. AI is just learning to play the game as we are, and now the next bots are here, and we're afraid they'll replace us? I'd say that instead of fighting AI for premium access into the meat grinder, we fight the current system. If this is what social media is, then let it die, and build anew. Hold social media companies accountable for what they've been doing to us for years. Stop letting algorithms optimized for profit control our communication, and build systems that are optimized for truth and compassion. The rise of AI in social media should be a wake up call for us all, that the internet now is not what it was promised to be, that it has been taken by massive companies and used to profit off us all. But we still have hope, to build an internet, that truly raises us up, and pushes us forward as a species.",

A feed of AI-generated Sora videos or a feed of human-created TikTok videos both aim to just hook you on a steady supply of dopamine; neither will help you accomplish a goal, better yourself, or build genuine human connection. Nobody is legally required to be on social media. And even among social media, there are much less addictive alternatives like Mastodon (which is precisely the reason they're a fraction of the size), or you can just read blogs on an RSS reader. AI is a very powerful technology, so it can make bad things worse. But we can also use it to make good things better.",

We may succeed at taking some platforms down through that process but many more would flood in to take their place. In my view the much deeper issue is how our brains work and more importantly, how easily they can be hacked and our thought processes disrupted. YouTube shorts for example are likely a kind of junk food which is actively harming us. We need stronger education around critical thinking and mental health, otherwise we'll continue to be harmed.",

                "raw_content": "Here are my thoughts in the ballpark of the post. Not necessarily addressing you, OP, just thinking out loud. In my view, an entertainment app or social media platform that makes hours fly by is simply better than one that doesn\u2019t. It does a better job of giving people what they want. By the same token, manufacturers shouldn\u2019t make food less tasty just because there\u2019s an obesity problem. You wouldn\u2019t make a couch less comfortable because someone spends too much time on it. Responsibility for use belongs to the individual, not anyone else. If your kid is spending too much time on an app, that\u2019s on you, not the company. It\u2019s a parent\u2019s job to teach self-regulation - that\u2019s how we raise responsible adults, not adult children. If you're spending too much time on social media - that's on you. If you get rage bated by the algorithm, or doom-scrolling - that's on you! \"Build systems optimized for truth and compassion\" - sure, no problem, if that's what people truly wanted. The market has figured out what people want, and algorithms optimize for that. No one is stopping anyone to create whatever social media platform they want. You can create one! I can understand moderation in certain contexts, such as, for example, gambling algorithms in games for underage children. But for adults... You do whatever you want - don't like social media, don't go there. Don't like shorts - don't watch them. Want to see a different platform? Make one! Is the Internet making you lonely? Go socialize in real life! It's alien to me that people are so eager to shift responsibility away from themselves. Evil companies, evil social media, evil AI. It's supply and demand. And personal responsibility. Exorcize the victim mentality out of oneself and evolve.",

        "text_content": "**What this benchmark measures:** METR-Horizon evaluates how long tasks AI agents can complete autonomously without human help. The metric is simple: if a task takes a human expert 30 minutes, can the AI do it on its own with 50% reliability? This directly measures real-world usefulness, not just test scores. For example, Claude Sonnet 4.5 can now handle tasks that take humans nearly 2 hours. **My Analysis:** I analyzed METR-Horizon data comparing pre-reasoning models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, etc.) versus reasoning models (o1, o3, Claude 4, etc.) and found two distinct scaling regimes: **Non-Reasoning Era (pre-Sep 2024):** * Doubling time: 8 months * Steady exponential progress on long-horizon tasks **Reasoning Era (Sep 2024 onward):** * Doubling time: 5 months (37% faster) * 2.2\u00d7 baseline performance jump from shift to reinforcement training on reasoning tasks * Inference-time compute appears to provide immediate capability gains **Key Insight:** The shift to reasoning models didn't just add a one-time boost. The faster doubling time means these models extract more value from scale, training, and algorithmic improvements. What would take 24 months in the non-reasoning paradigm now takes \\~15 months. Fitted exponentials using RANSAC to ensure robust fitting with outliers. Both eras show clear exponential trends (straight lines on semi-log plot).

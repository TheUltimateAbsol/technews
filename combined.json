This second-generation model is our most sophisticated yet, utilizing five times the compute power of the original transformer model, having been trained on a significantly expanded, high-fidelity dataset. The model has a deeper understanding in every scene, and more intelligently uses game engine pixel sampling and motion data to deliver images that have better lighting, finer edges, and improved motion clarity. DLSS 4.5 achieves a breakthrough in lighting effects by solving a traditional challenge faced by Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA), and earlier super resolution models. Previous techniques operated in logarithmic space to dampen flickering, which unfortunately resulted in muted lighting, clipped details, and crushed shadows in high-contrast scenes. In comparison, DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution trains and infers directly in linear space, the game engine\u2019s native ground truth. Because the new AI model is powerful enough to manage instability without compressing the data, it accumulates lighting with physical accuracy, allowing glowing neon signs and bright reflections to retain their full color range and detail. DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution takes full advantage of GeForce RTX 40 and 50 Series GPUs, which benefit from faster, more advanced Tensor Cores in our latest architectures. By leveraging FP8 precision capabilities, the hardware doubles inference throughput, allowing the 2nd generation transformer to run with a minor performance tradeoff compared to the first. While DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution enhances image quality across all settings, including Quality and Balanced modes, the transformation is greatest in Performance and Ultra Performance modes, where fewer rendered pixels are available. By leveraging the power of the 2nd generation transformer, Performance Mode is now comparable to, and can even beat, native image quality, while Ultra Performance has evolved into a truly viable mode for 4K gaming. Overall, DLSS 4.5 delivers a significant leap in image quality across the board, resulting in sharper anti-aliasing, reduced ghosting, and enhanced temporal stability.",

        "text_content": "Namely, we are going to get to experience a trilogy of big AAA games within a reasonable timeframe. Remake is out in a fortnight, Rebirth is already confirmed to be coming (and I'd imagine it'll be either late this year or early 2027). While nothing's confirmed regarding the third part, it's extremely likely to be on Switch 2 and will probably release late 2027 or early 2028. In other words, after picking up Remake later this month, people playing this for the first time will most likely be wrapping things up with the final (and brand new) game just a couple of years later. With modern game development times, this is an astonishingly rare state of affairs - although, in my opinion, it's close to a perfect one. To be fair to Squenix, given modern development times, the 8 years or so it'll likely be for people getting each part at its original release is actually relatively quick work, but still...8 *years* from playing the first entry to seeing the ending is a long ass time. In contrast to this, Switch owners especially, might often have experienced trilogies or series of games all getting ported at once and released as a collection. This can be cool, but not all games (and massive jrpgs would be one such type) lend themselves to being played in quick succession, and while 4 years of waiting might be a bit much, a little bit of anticipation can actually be a good, exciting thing that adds to the experience of playing a game. Also, these collections are invariably of all old games, whereas in this case the final entry will be a brand new modern game that we'll be playing at launch. So yeah, playing through this trilogy with each game likely coming about one year apart is, to me, at least, pretty much the perfect release cadence. We'll never have to wait too long between releases while there'll still be enough of a break to both have a bit of a breather and build some anticipation, and it's all going to end with a big, new release that no one's played before. (I just hope I do actually like the game and want to keep going with the rest.)",

        "score": 195,
        "text_content": "Rumors increasingly suggest that Warhorse is working in parallel on a second project (\u201cProject X\u201d) in Unreal Engine alongside Kingdom Come: Deliverance 3 in CryEngine, or at least laying the groundwork for it. While it\u2019s considered all but certain that Warhorse is currently working on KCD3 in CryEngine (they likely wouldn\u2019t start two entirely new IPs, and they\u2019re still recruiting for Lua expertise), the following current and recent job postings strongly support the existence of a separate Unreal Engine project: \u2022 A Senior Technical Animator role explicitly asks for Unreal Animation Blueprints, state machines, and physics-based animations. That\u2019s production-level UE work, not generic \u201cengine experience.\u201d \u2022 A DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer posting lists TeamCity / Unreal Engine Horde as a nice-to-have, which points to UE-oriented build and CI tooling (automation, testing workflows, etc.). \u2022 Probably the biggest giveaway: an external tech-art recruiting post links to Warhorse\u2019s listings and explicitly mentions a \u201cnext UE project.\u201d The account behind that post identifies itself as Jakub Hol\u00edk, Lead TechOps at Warhorse. \u2022 Another supporting hint: a Lighting Artist listing mentions Blueprints (alongside scripting like Python) as a plus, which, while not definitive on its own, aligns with UE workflows. There are also smaller signs pointing in the same direction: several job posts use phrasing like \u201cwork on exciting AAA games\u201d (plural), which can imply more than one project. At the same time, they seem to be scaling up longer-term in-house capabilities (QA ownership, checklists/regression, tooling/CI). Notably, the QA listing even includes a concrete onboarding window (e.g., April/May 2026), and they\u2019re hiring multiple QA testers at once (both junior and senior), which fits a studio ramping up for a sustained parallel development.

There's no detail on whether both the 12 GB / 8 GB models or one of those will be produced, but the RTX 3060 is going to be made available on retail shelves once again. >This indicates the extent to which the DRAM shortages have affected consumer GPUs. The GeForce RTX 5060 makes use of GDDR7 memory, and as DRAM costs rise, the [RTX 5060](https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5060-gaming-oc-8-gb-gpu-review-mainstream-gamers-deserve-better/) might not only be affected in terms of pricing but also in supply, since procuring the memory is also an issue due to poor supply.

Wait, an AIO cooler? I wonder why that's in a motherboard post.... \\*I'm going to mark this as a WIP article because we currently don't have images or additional information about some of the boards, which we expect in a couple weeks. I will update this post when this information becomes available, but we have a lot to share currently\\* >I also want to point out that our AMD microsite is updated [here](https://www.asus.com/microsite/motherboard/amd-am5-ryzen-9000-x3d-x870e-x870-b850-b840/?utm_source=press_release&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=trick-out-your-build), and if you scroll down the page you'll see a section that says \"Choose Your X870E/X870... Motherboard\". Just below that header you'll see an option for \"Full Specs Download\", and you can download a PDF with several of these boards added. The rest will be added in the near future. Despite gaps in some of the information here, these are the boards that are part of our new AMD 800 Series lineup: * ROG Crosshair X870E Glacial * ROG Crosshair X870E Dark Hero * ROG Strix X870E-E Gaming WiFi NEO * ROG Strix X870E-A Gaming WiFi NEO * TUF Gaming X870-PRO WiFi 7 W NEO * ROG Strix B850-F Gaming WiFi7 NEO\\*\\* * ROG Strix B850-A Gaming WiFi7 NEO\\*\\* * TUF Gaming B850-PRO WiFi7 W NEO * ProArt B850-CREATOR WIFI Neo\\*\\* \\*\\*At this time I will not be including these motherboards, but may in a future update. # AIO Q-Connector and the ROG Strix LC IV AIO Cooler https://preview.redd.it/dm1ucin4smbg1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f54449975316577eaf9a83b952707e835944aa6 When we began our BTF hidden-connector ecosystem to enable PC builders to create clean and cable-free builds, some doubted whether it would be something people wanted to use. With our latest BTF Gen 2.5 designs offering new ways to build a BTF PC and, frankly, some of the similar designs you'll see at CES from other brands, the momentum continues to pickup. But what about other parts of your PC that leave unsightly wires, such as your AIO? Fans now utilize magnetic connectors to reduce cabling, but you still have pesky 4pin AIO and USB connectors to deal with, right? Yeah, we're tired of them too. Enter the AIO Q-Connector present on select new AM5 motherboards and the ROG Strix LC IV AIO Cooler, the first cooler to take advantage of this feature. https://preview.redd.it/bv688l27smbg1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6476c3bbfb8198456609515d54388c02cb7f152 These motherboards feature exclusive Q-Connector pins that allow you to connect compatible CPU coolers without the need for additional cables. Through these metal contact points, ROG Strix LC IV series AIO CPU liquid coolers receive power and control signals for the pump, ARGB elements, and (with select models) the display. https://preview.redd.it/c2dspy4xsmbg1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b20df52bd737273f63d8820b04f92b884b00b443 There's someone out there who will say that it could have been made better since you still have to deal with the fan wires. We thought of that too. The AIO Q-Connector passes along the PWM signals to the fans through a cable hidden inside the tube sleeving. That's right, no wires. The motherboards that will support this at launch are: * ROG Crosshair X870E Glacial * ROG Crosshair X870E Dark Hero * ROG Strix X870E-E Gaming WiFi7 NEO * ROG Strix X870E-A Gaming WiFi7 NEO The ROG Strix LC IV Series will include both SLC (short tube length), LC, and an LC version that replaces the 5.08\" LCD display with an ARGB logo atop the pump housing. Note that this AIO cooler also includes a separate cable in case you install it to a motherboard without the AIO Q-Connector. These are expected to be available in Q2. # New AMD 800 Series Lineup Features Before we dive into each motherboard, we will cover the similar features and improvements that you can expect with these boards. We continue to move top-tier features across the boards such as AEMP, NitroPath DRAM technology and DIMM Fit, while including USB4, WiFi7 and new EZ PCDIY functions. **Optimized PCIe Lanes** \\- One of the common complaints about modern motherboards is that due to lane-sharing, your primary PCIe slot often is lowered to x8/x8 if you use your second CPU-derived PCIe slot or a PCIe Gen5 M.2. With our new series, we've optimized the lane-sharing to include both M.2 and USB4 ports to give you greater flexibility to keep your first PCIe slot running at x16. With the ROG Strix X870E-E Gaming WiFi7 Neo, for instance, you\u2019ll be able to achieve the full bandwidth of the PCIe 5.0 x16 slot with two PCIe 5.0 M.2 SSDs and three PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs installed. **Server-grade PCB Design -** Select motherboards utilize an ultra-low-etch manufacturing process, PCB back-drilling, 2-ounce copper power planes, and an 8-layer design. These processes ultimately improve memory compatibility, lead to better stability, allow for larger capacities, and improve overclocking potential. **64MB BIOS ROM Now Preinstalled with WiFi Drivers** \\- Higher-capacity memory on the BIOS allows for more complex BIOS designs, out-of-the box support for the latest AMD CPUs, but it also impacts how many drivers can be stored and read by the OS during installation. By moving from 32MB to 64MB, the motherboard can include storage space for WiFi drivers. Now, when you go to install your OS, the drivers will be stored on the board making installation much simpler and faster. **3D Vapor Chamber M.2 Heatsink** \\- Select models offer a taller M.2 heatsink with a larger heat dissipation area through a 3D vapor chamber with a tool-free design. **More USB 2.0 Ports** \\- Select motherboards will now feature three USB2.0 ports (up from 2) to connect more internal devices. **USB Type-C Ports up to 60W Quick Charge 4+** \\- Select motherboards will feature 60W ports that can quickly charge your smartphone or other devices to make your PC a more convenient charging station. **New EZ Mode BIOS Interface** \\- We're always looking for ways to improve the main BIOS for novices and advanced users, and with the new EZ Mode and Essential Mode options both can look forward to quickly configuring monitoring and commonly used functions. For example with Essential Mode, you can view key system information and access the most commonly-used overclocking functions without having to go into the more granular Advanced Mode. https://preview.redd.it/xtq1z9n1umbg1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b6f355d5998161e88c9ef3e28bc1573f958fa13 # New AMD 800 Series Motherboards **ROG Crosshair X870E Glacial** https://preview.redd.it/caje91uqtmbg1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2aa0ce9f1ab35856b96c9140281a53c80798a3e9 Flagship performance meets AI optimization in the ROG Crosshair X870E Glacial, engineered for extreme performance and next-generation overclocking. With 24 (110A)+2(110A)+2 power stages, Dynamic OC Switcher, and Core Flex, it delivers stable, efficient power. DDR5 memory enhanced by AEMP and NitroPath DRAM Technology ensures peak speed and reliability. **Seven M.2 slots** \\- including dual PCIe 5.0 onboard, an additional two PCIe 5.0 via Hyper M.2, and two PCIe 4.0 via Q-DIMM.2 - offer expansive high-speed storage. Dual USB4 ports, dual USB 20Gbps Type-C front connectors (one of which features Quick Charge 4+ (up to 60W)) twelve USB 10Gbps ports, and dual Realtek 10G Ethernet cover all connectivity needs. ASUS-exclusive AI features, such as AI Cache Boost, ASUS AI Advisor, and AI Overclocking streamline setup and maximize performance, while the full-color 5-inch LCD simplifies system monitoring. PCIe Slot Q-Release Switch, AIO Q-Connector, and SafeSlots further ensure an effortless installation experience. Let's talk about a few of these features in detail: **ROG Hyper M.2 Card and ROG Q-DIMM.2 -** ROG-designed cards for M.2 SSDs are not new, but here we have new cards designed to get the most out of PCIe Gen5 M.2 and PCIe Gen4 M.2 SSDs, respectively, as each is capable of supporting two SSDs. This saves space on the board and gives a huge variety of options to maximize your storage. https://preview.redd.it/kabzfm1ztmbg1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7709eddb1aea04286050f0bc13eb714b1b8a62b5 **Optimized PCIe Lane Sharing -** Enjoy the full bandwidth of the first PCIe 5.0 x16 slot and two PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots while still being able to use the second PCIe x16 slot at PCIe 3.0 x4.

They're built well, easily cover the specs and performance of the most demanding gaming PCs, and still leave room for a bit extra. And yes, our MB teams have been knocking it out of the park lately with the TUF Gaming aesthetic in both black and white. With options in both the X870 and B850 families, you have a great choice between a board that easily handles gaming, and a board that's ready for more storage, more tinkering, and more cooling. Each of these boards also include overclocking features such as asynchronous clock, Dynamic OC Switcher, and Core Flex. Built with an eight-layer PCB, these boards can enjoy better compatibility with premium memory kits and better stability if you choose to overclock. EZ PCDIY features are packed on these boards, including our M.2 Q-Latch, M.2 Q-Release, and a physical PCIe Slot Q-Release lever. Both boards also include a rear-I/O panel CLR CMOS button making it easier for novices to learn about overclocking, as well. **TUF Gaming X870-Pro WiFi7 W Neo** https://preview.redd.it/lns4vbkavmbg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=91038ac02161d1abf07ace2e7cb27844e6ba09e4 As the higher-end of the two boards, the TUF Gaming X870-Pro WiFi7 W Neo provides you with a bit higher ceiling on its power design, network ports, USB4 options, and an extra PCIe M.2 Gen5 slot. Where this board differs from the previously mentioned ROG Strix Neo motherboards is that you have fewer USB 10Gbps rear ports, one fewer USB 20Gbps Type-C and USB 5Gbps Type-A front panel headers each, several Q-Design features, but nothing that gets in the way of setting up a powerful gaming system or makes the installation process notably more difficult. **WiFi 7, BT5.4 and 5G Ethernet Port -** Built for fast connections, you'll be ready for blazing fast speed and low-latency gaming. **Plenty of USB -** 2x USB4 40Gbps Type-C, 3x USB 10Gbps ports on the rear panel, 4x USB 5Gbps, but you also have 3x USB 2.0, 1x USB 20Gbps Type-C (30W PD/PPS Fast-charge), 1x USB 5Gbps Type-A front panel port, and 3x USB 2.0 front panel ports. **Other notable features:** * 4x DIMM, 256GB DDR5 * M.2 Q-Latch, M.2 Q-Release, Q-Antenna, PCIe Q-Release lever * 3x ARGB Headers * 1x (each) CPU Fan Header, CPU OPT Fan Header, AIO Pump Header, W\\_Pump+ Header * 4x Chassis Fan Header The TUF Gaming X870-Pro WiFi7 Neo availability is expected in mid-Q1 currently. * Product page: [https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/tuf-gaming/tuf-gaming-x870-pro-wifi7-w-neo](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/tuf-gaming/tuf-gaming-x870-pro-wifi7-w-neo) **TUF Gaming B850-Pro WiFi7 W Neo** https://preview.redd.it/imgxv24ivmbg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=015be21e23d1e1628a07f1524360af4336bb15f2 As a B850 motherboard, you expect that there will be some concessions around lane-sharing and certain other features, and it's no surprise that there are a few compared to its bigger brother. However, a B850 is still no slouch when it comes to performance or providing features for core PC-building. If you're looking for a B850 board like the TUF Gaming B850-Pro WiFi7 W Neo, then you probably have a pretty clear idea about what you want to include in your system and you don't need slots or ports that you won't end up using. Comparatively, you have one less PCIe Gen5 M.2 slot, but you pick up a pair of PCIe 4.0 x1 slots, which can be used to add an expansion card if you need additional USB or other expansion ports. Networking is reduced to 2.5Gbps, which is still much faster than many use for a wired connection currently, and you still have WiFi7 and BT5.4 for connectivity. Ultimately, you still have 10x rear-panel USB ports, including 2x USB 10Gbps Type-C ports. A USB 20Gbps Type-C front-panel connector more than suffices for many chassis, currently, and you still have a standard USB 5Gbps front panel port to go with 3x USB2.0 ports. **Other notable features:** * 4x DIMM, 256GB DDR5 * M.2 Q-Latch, M.2 Q-Release, Q-Antenna, PCIe Q-Release lever * 3x ARGB Gen2 Headers * 1x (each) CPU Fan Header, CPU OPT Fan Header, AIO Pump Header * 4x Chassis Fan Header The TUF Gaming B850-Pro WiFi7 Neo availability is currently TBD, but will be updated when I have additional information. * Product page: [https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/tuf-gaming/tuf-gaming-b850-pro-wifi7-w-neo](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/tuf-gaming/tuf-gaming-b850-pro-wifi7-w-neo) As noted above, some information and images aren't currently available right now, so I plan to make some updates and/or update images over the next couple of weeks, including availability dates/times.

You can now speculate on the direction of home prices with Polymarket using Parcl's housing data. Looks like they are first rolling out 5 different metro and city markets to predict including the US median home price. Here are the first US housing market predictions you can speculate on. They plan on rolling out more in the future: - What will the median home value in the US be on February 1? - What will the median home value in the Austin, Texas Metro area be on February 1? - What will the median home value in the San Francisco Metro area be on February 1? - What will the median home value in Miami be on February 1? - What will the median home value in New York City be on February 1? - What will the median home value in the Los Angeles Metro area be on February 1? https://parcl.co/blog/parcl-x-polymarket-launch-real-estate-prediction-markets",

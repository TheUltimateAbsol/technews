The clip emphasizes suspicious details, including Thomas Crooks' appearance in a BlackRock ad, possession of five phones, immediate body cremation, and cellphone signals traveling between his home and FBI D.C. offices, fueling speculation of coordinated involvement without formal FBI reports or press briefings. These claims echo persistent public scrutiny of Secret Service failures, such as unsecured roof access despite visible warnings from bystanders, contrasting with rapid evidence handling in past cases like JFK, and highlighting demands for cellphone records and unredacted files amid no confirmed updates on the announcement as of the post date.",

After the unenthusiastic launch of the third-generation VE30 in 2022, *The Next Platform* [reported](https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/03/23/is-this-the-end-of-the-line-for-nec-vector-supercomputers/) on the rumored demise of SX-Aurora TSUBASA platform. The ambitious original roadmap, which stretched out to the fifth-generation VE50, was not met, with no word whatsoever of the VE40. It appeared for a while that the SX-Aurora was truly dead, but it appears that NEC has been and is busy working on moving it to a RISC-V-based vector processor co-designed with Openchip. What does concern me is that it appears they're targeting it at AI as opposed to HPC with AI on the side as with earlier systems. AI, as we all know, is largely dominated by NVIDIA, AMD, and a handful of proprietary processors from hyperscalers; and completely over-saturated with mostly unproven startups. Historically, there was a 7 year hiatus in the SX series, between 2007's SX-9 and 2014's SX-ACE, which was caused by NEC and Hitachi bailing out of Japan's original K supercomputer design, which would have featured NEC and Hitachi co-designed vector processors bolted onto Fujitsu SPARC64-based scalar processors. It would be quite a feat if NEC could pull off another resurgence of vector supercomputers in this day and age, when NVIDIA and AMD release a new GPU yearly.",

Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time. To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. I encourage you all to listen to the conference call \u2013 which will be available via the Investor section of our site \u2014 just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings. Thanks for your understanding.

        "text_content": "Everyone's focused on the Fed and mortgage rates, but there's a bigger shift happening that directly impacts US housing. China held $1.3 trillion in US Treasuries at the 2013 peak. They're now down to $775 billion \u2014 a $500+ billion reduction. At the same time, they've bought gold for 12 consecutive months and their central bank reserves just hit record highs. Why does this matter for housing? When foreign central banks dump Treasuries, yields rise. Higher Treasury yields = higher mortgage rates, even if the Fed pauses. We're not just fighting the Fed anymore \u2014 we're fighting a global de-dollarization trend. The 10-year Treasury yield directly influences 30-year mortgage rates. If China (and other BRICS nations following the same playbook) keep reducing Treasury holdings, mortgage rates stay elevated regardless of what Powell does. Here's the kicker: This isn't temporary trade war posturing. This is structural. China's building an alternative system where they settle trade in yuan backed by commodities (gold, oil). Less demand for dollars = less demand for Treasuries = persistently higher yields = higher mortgage rates. So while everyone's waiting for the Fed to \"pivot\" and save housing, there's a parallel force keeping rates high that has nothing to do with US monetary policy. The 2020-2021 housing boom happened partly because foreign central banks were still buying Treasuries aggressively, keeping yields suppressed. That tailwind is now a headwind. Just something to consider when people say \"rates will drop soon.\" The Fed's only half the equation now.",

Given this year's tariffs and threats you can only expect this decline to continue quickly. Some estimates suggest the dollar loses majority in late 2020's or early 2030's depending on a number of factors.

        "score": 158,
        "text_content": "Abstract: >LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies. This connects to the Continual Thought concept I wrote about in a comment on reddit recently: >But we also need continual thought! We also think constantly about things to prepare for the future or to think through different Szenarios the ideas that we think are most important or successful. We then save it in our long term memory via continual learning. We humans are also self critical thus I think a true AGI should have another thought stream that constantly criticizes the first thought Stream and thinks about how some thoughts could have been thought faster or which mistakes could habe been avoided or have been made by the whole system or how the whole AGI could have acted more intelligent. I think this paper is a big step in creating the thought streams i was talking about. The Paper solves the reliabilty problem that would prevent the creation of thought streams until now. This paper allows an AI that would normally derail after a few hundred steps to go to one million steps and potentially infinite more with Zero errors! Thus I think it is a huge architectual breakthrough that will at least in my opinion allow for far smarter AIs then we have seen until now. Together with [https://research.google/blog/introducing-nested-learning-a-new-ml-paradigm-for-continual-learning/](https://research.google/blog/introducing-nested-learning-a-new-ml-paradigm-for-continual-learning/) and [https://deepmind.google/blog/sima-2-an-agent-that-plays-reasons-and-learns-with-you-in-virtual-3d-worlds/](https://deepmind.google/blog/sima-2-an-agent-that-plays-reasons-and-learns-with-you-in-virtual-3d-worlds/) that are beginning to solve continual learning we could see truly remakable AIs in the near future that solve problems we could not even begin to accomplish with AIs that were made befor these breakthroughs! **Website:** [https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/ai-lab/blog/maker](https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/ai-lab/blog/maker) **Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09030](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09030) **Youtube:** [https://youtu.be/8OvIeJUc1N0?si=1GI1C3N6l477A5MV](https://youtu.be/8OvIeJUc1N0?si=1GI1C3N6l477A5MV)",

A spokesperson told CNBC on Friday that the company still hopes to go public as soon as possible. >Cerebras filed for an IPO just over a year ago, as it was ramping up to take on Nvidia in an effort to create processors for running generative AI models. The filing revealed a heavy reliance on a single customer in the United Arab Emirates, Microsoft-backed G42, which is also a Cerebras investor. >In its prospectus, Cerebras said it had given voluntary notice to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States about selling shares to G42. In March, the company announced that the committee had provided clearance. >Since its initial filing to go public on the Nasdaq, Cerebras has shifted its focus away from selling systems and more toward providing a cloud service for accepting incoming queries to models that use its chips underneath. >The announced withdrawal comes three days into a U.S. government shutdown that\u2019s left agencies like the SEC operating with a small staff. In a plan for a shutdown published in August, the SEC said its electronic system EDGAR \u201cis operated pursuant to a contract and thus will remain fully functional as long as funding for the contractor remains available through permitted means.\u201d >On Tuesday, Cerebras said it had raised $1.1 billion at a valuation of $8.1 billion in a private funding round. At the time, CEO Andrew Feldman said that the company still wanted to go public, rather than continue to raise venture capital. >\u201cI don\u2019t think this is an indication of a preference for one or the other,\u201d he told CNBC in an interview. \u201cI think we have tremendous opportunities in front of us, and I think it\u2019s good practice, when you have enormous opportunities, not to let them fall by the wayside for lack of capital.\u201d >Feldman thought the original prospectus from last year was out of date, especially considering developments in AI, the spokesperson said on Friday. >Well heeled technology companies have been quickly signing up for additional infrastructure to handle demand. On Tuesday CoreWeave, which rents out Nvidia chips through a cloud service, said it had signed a $14.2 billion agreement with Meta. ChatGPT operator OpenAI said last week that it had committed to spending $300 billion on cloud services from Oracle. >The government shutdown did not factor into Cerebras\u2019 decision, the spokesperson said.",

Even if they got a 10 billion dollar order, they don\u2019t have the supply chain and feb capacity to fill the order. Those who would buy Cerebras already bought them. The only meaningful new revenue stream is for them to self host and sell tokens at a lost. There\u2019s little upside for Cerebras.",

Here\u2019s the TLDR: Buy switch 1 digital deluxe Edition for $14, then search the eShop again and then rebuy the Switch 2 Digital Deluxe version for $15 more, grand total $29. You save $50! If you have the cartridge go to additional content page from within the game to \u201cpurchase\u201d the free discount DLC then go to the eShop. Edit: the base game is now on sale today! If you don\u2019t care for the DLC on switch 1 or 2 you can try this Buy Base game on Switch 1 for $11, then Refresh the eShop and buy the switch 2 version for $10+ For a total of $21. Rest of the post: Here is what I found out. The game is currently on sale on Switch 1 for $14 USD for the digital deluxe edition with the Dark Arts DLC. I messed up and got the switch 1 deluxe version and the switch 2 basic upgrade for $10 instead of the deluxe edition for $15 and I do not have the Dark Arts DLC on Switch 2. Once you buy the game two things happen, the eShop version for Nintendo Switch 2 drops from $70 to $10. And the digital deluxe drops from $80 to $15 But also there\u2019s another step that may not be needed really. Once you have the switch version installed and the game is booted you can go the \u201cAdditional Content\u201d page and you\u2019ll see Switch Discount DLC that you \u201cpurchase\u201d for free. This should trigger the discounts as well but it also drops the price of the separate Dark arts DLC from $20 to $14 (it should have been $5!). I messed up and got the switch 1 deluxe version and the switch 2 basic upgrade for $10 instead of the deluxe edition for $15 and I do not have the Dark Arts DLC on Switch 2 and I will have to buy it separately. :(",

It was one of those situations where, despite folks being told 'hey, we wanna pull the trigger on this in 2026', the steps you would need to take in the lead up to delivering a new console gen weren't being met. >Lots of things that were 'sure things' started getting pushed. The Costco retailer pulling Xbox, and apparently they are one of many that we'll learn about soon, told me all I needed to know. >To sum it up: the future of Xbox is software publishing, with a significantly honed-in focus on profitable IPs (CoD, WoW, Minecraft, Candy Crush, Forza Horizon), Cloud gaming being the home of the 'Xbox platform', transititioning GamePass into basically becoming the point of entry subscription for xCloud access (which will continue to drive its price tag higher btw, they aren't done there just yet either), and releasing their software on any device that has a marketplace and users willing to buy their titles. >Maybe some OEM thing will take up the Xbox name, but given what is clearly a collapse in favorable mindshare and faith in said brand, i'm not even sure a 3rd party OEM is gonna want to have an Xbox console by the time MS is done with their reorienting of the division.

Noticeably cooler than 21-22 but things are moving. Urban homeowner stuff not doing as well. Flippers are getting stuck but other investors haven't gotten the memo and are still buying, rehabbing and trying to offload into rising inventory. A fair amount of people taking losses on 2022+ purchases, even some stretching back as far as pre COVID in certain neighborhoods. Higher end downtown condos probably the worst followed by SFH in the more speculative \"revitalizing\" areas. As expected. Urban low end rental crap is holding up the best. The biggerpockets crowd still buying garbage in shit neighborhoods at negative cash flow prices. These people could find a way to lose money in any market. Ground zero of this bubble imo. A lot of this stuff is up 4-6x since the good old days when investors could actually make money whereas rents are up maybe 1.5-2x. I keep thinking I must be missing something but the math tells me that they are all losing money. A lot of them were losing money pre covid too but the appreciation made up for it. This REO tape dealer guy I used to talk to years ago got in touch last week about a fund that was offloading, we talk for a bit to catch up and I go on this long rant roughly equivalent to that last paragraph and when I finish he just goes \"everything you said is correct\". Very small trickle of distressed/foreclosure deals starting to come through finally. The latter is almost all private money or commercial bank loans. All investors. Almost no homeowners. TLDR the homeowners are pulling back but investors haven't gotten the memo yet. I have always maintained that the investors have been driving this at least in markets like mine.

I thought making this argument was important because many people do not see the importance of AI understanding the physical world. When World Models are brought up, they think it's \"cool but not essential\". They tie it to robotics only and don't see how it's relevant to building cancer-solving and physics-discovering AGI. My arguments can be summarized as follows: 1. The core concepts from math and coding, even the abstract ones, are extracted from the physical world 2. The way humans reason is visual before being symbolic. Many mathematical and scientific discoveries happened through analogy with the real world. I hope this piece helps people understand why World Models are so important, even though I have no illusions of settling this debate!",

Math, coding, art, and reasoning seem inextricably linked to the physical world because humans are inextricably linked to the physical world. It doesn't follow that AI systems are fundamentally unable to do these things at a human level without a virtual world model. I think world models and many other approaches to make AI more human-like would get us closer to AGI, but the goal is matching human capability in cognitive tasks, not putting a brain on a computer. Current approaches seem to be getting us there and arguments for why they won't seem ridiculous and arbitrary. It's a different kind of intelligence, just because it doesn't have x or y features found in humans doesn't mean it can't match capabilities in its own way.",

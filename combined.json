SHORT TITLE.This Act may be cited as the \"Illegal Benefits Enforcement Act of 2025\" or \"IBEA 2025\".SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.(a) Findings.\u2014Congress finds that: (1) Federal benefits programs, including but not limited to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, housing assistance, and unemployment insurance, are funded by taxpayer dollars and intended exclusively for United States citizens and lawful permanent residents. (2) The provision of such benefits to undocumented immigrants undermines the integrity of these programs and imposes undue financial burdens on American taxpayers. (3) Government employees who knowingly facilitate or are complicit in such provisions violate public trust and existing federal immigration laws.(b) Purpose.\u2014The purpose of this Act is to establish criminal penalties and fines for government employees complicit in supplying federal benefits to undocumented immigrants, thereby ensuring accountability and deterring future violations.SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.For the purposes of this Act: (a) Government Employee means any individual employed by a federal, state, or local government agency, including contractors and agents acting on behalf of such agencies. (b) Undocumented Immigrant means any non-citizen present in the United States without lawful immigration status under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq.). (c) Federal Benefits means any assistance, grant, loan, entitlement, or subsidy provided under federal law and intended for U.S. citizens or lawful residents. (d) Complicit means knowingly or recklessly aiding, abetting, facilitating, or failing to report the provision of federal benefits to an undocumented immigrant.SECTION 4. PROHIBITIONS AND PENALTIES.(a) Prohibition.\u2014It shall be unlawful for any government employee to be complicit in the approval, distribution, or facilitation of federal benefits to any undocumented immigrant. (b) Criminal Penalties.\u2014 (1) Any government employee who violates subsection (a) shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, shall be imprisoned for not less than 1 year nor more than 5 years. (2) If the violation results in benefits exceeding $10,000 in value, the term of imprisonment shall be not less than 3 years nor more than 10 years. (c) Civil Fines.\u2014In addition to criminal penalties, violators shall be subject to a civil fine of not less than $5,000 nor more than $50,000 per violation, payable to the United States Treasury. (d) Additional Consequences.\u2014Conviction under this section shall result in immediate termination of employment and permanent ineligibility for future government employment or benefits.SECTION 5. ENFORCEMENT.(a) The Attorney General of the United States, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security and the Inspector General of relevant agencies, shall investigate and prosecute violations of this Act. (b) Whistleblower protections shall apply to any individual reporting violations, pursuant to the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8)).SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment.Passed the House of Representatives [Date]. Passed the Senate [Date]. Approved by the President [Date].

In our original email communications it is because Linus T drives 2 x 6K displays and needed something more than integrated graphics without being an annoying loud or power hungry \"gaming\" class GPU. It was suppose to be a Intel Arc B50 but we could not get one in time of shooting. Linus T clarified he was still more than ok at the time of filming with this GPU being used.

On a personal note, as someone who only plays on consoles and controllers: as much as it is intuitive to just drop your right joycon and switch playstyles, I found it a bit clunky. And between switching playstyles + the lock on feature, the controls for the camera became a bit disorienting. Obviously it's a non issue for anyone sticking to one playstyle, I just thought mixing it up would be fun The prologue reminds me so much of prime 3, cool action scenes, elaborate setpieces, and it drops Samus right into the chaos. It's making me consider getting a switch 2 \ud83d\ude29",

It obviously won't look as good and you can't play with Mouse Mode, but it will still be playable at 60fps so you are hardly getting a bad experience (unless you are playing on a 4k TV, since I would think that the potential 9 times multiplier of resolution is highly significant). I would not buy a Switch 2 if this is the only game you care about and you have the Switch 1 though, since the game is cheaper by upgrading with an NSO voucher anyway so you may as well wait until exclusives you care about release, at which point you can buy the Switch 2 Edition if you feel like another play through.",

The community validated my findings (my post reached **280+ upvotes**, **65 comments**, **100+ shares**, and reached the **top of the sub's front page**). Instead of addressing the issue, the moderators **permanently banned me** and removed the thread to silence the discussion. ***(EDIT: All references to the official sub, including the link to the original post, have been removed from this text and redacted in the screenshots to comply with Reddit Rules.)*** ***(EDIT 2: I have pinned the link to the original deleted thread on my user profile so you can verify the full context yourself.)*** **The Full Story:** I have been a Pro subscriber specifically for the \"Deep Research\" feature, which is sold as an \"Autonomous Agent\" that \"reads hundreds of sources\" and takes \"4-5 minutes\" to reason through complex tasks and deliver a comprehensive report.

The provided snapshots from Aug/Sept are the most recent stable versions and confirm these specs have been the published standard for months.)* Recently (some months), the service degraded massively. My \"Deep Research\" queries were finishing in 30 seconds with only 10-15 sources, essentially behaving like a standard search wrapper but sold at a premium. I posted a detailed analysis on their official subreddit. I didn't attack anyone; I simply compared their **Official Help Center Documentation and Launch Blog** against the actual **Product Output**: * **Advertised Spec:** \"Reads hundreds of sources\" / \"Takes 4-5 minutes\". * **Actual Reality:** Reads \\~10 sources / Takes \\~30 seconds. The community **rallied** behind my post. **280+ upvotes**, **65 comments**, **100+ shares**, and reached the **top of the sub's front page** during the 24 hours my post was up. It became a hub for other users confirming the same throttling. It was a legitimate customer complaint backed by data. https://preview.redd.it/l4fle87woh4g1.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6dfb47907c82dd4948e5037c21c84147fd8a98a **Today, I received a Permanent Ban and the thread got deleted.** No warning.

If you rely on Perplexity for your workflow, be careful. They will degrade the product you rely on without warning, and the moment you provide evidence of the decline, they will silence you rather than fix it.",

I watched, in disbelief, as the lines of code just appeared out of nowhere and formed a simple, but fully functional app. I mean, I'd already been aware of LLMs for a couple of years prior, but just seeing it like that in action, like a real programmer but automated, was mind-blowing. AI went from sci-fi to reality for me that day. I will never forget that moment.",

This is the end of the era of expensive middlemen like Amazon and Microsoft: now AI queries are processed with 100% confidentiality, no tracking, and at prices below market rate. Key features: Privacy first: Your data doesn't leak \u2014 everything runs in trusted execution environments (TEE). For GPU owners: Connect your graphics cards and contribute your compute power. The first queries are already rolling in. Scaling ahead: More GPUs and developers coming in the next few weeks. Telegram users will soon get new AI features (like message translation) with full privacy. This is a step toward truly decentralized AI, putting control back in users' hands. Game-changer?

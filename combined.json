In my case, my temperature delta shrank from 15c to around 6-7c compared to X45 from ID-Coolimg which performs more or less on par with Kryonaut Extreme, for reference. I still wouldn't apply PTM on a CPU IHS however, but that's mostly because of cost. Both AM4 and AM5 CPUs are roughly 40x40 millimeter which equates to 1,600 sq-mm or over twice the surface area of an RTX5090. Very expensive! So, I instead bought a 4g tube of aforementioned X45 for cheap which will probably allow around half a dozen CPU repastes and the performance is quite fantastic, considering the price.",

Valve knows from the SteamMachine Gen1 failure & the SteamDeck success that price is king. There is no feasible way that they will be able to sell well at a base price that isn't tethered in some way to the 2020 consoles. That's why they chose 2-3 gen old components that are literally a budget entry-level gaming laptop. An RX7600M laptop GPU with 8GB isn't going to break the bank, either way they have to know that more than a PS5/XSX will be devastating. If RAM pushes it up, the other consoles will also have to move up giving Valve more room for price parity. Either way, these articles are nothing but egregious speculation presented as fact, until Valve actually announces a price, the SteamMachine (2026) doesn't have a price.",

Switching costs are not just low, they're perhaps even negative - if, as a customer, you don't switch to the better product, you might be left behind. Has there ever been a business like this? At least one that was playing such a pivotal role in the global economy?",

The computer did not upgrade every 3-6 months, certainly not in a way that you must switch to otherwise you are far behind (let's say Sonnet 4.5/Codex vs other models in agentic coding). Human-built software takes time and does not radically improve every 3-6 months. Cars take decades to meaningfully improve. Smartphones took years to perfect and don't become obsolete every release. It is a good indicator this is the real deal. We are on that curve that is quickly going vertical towards the Singularity. I think the most meaningful metric right now is how much digital intelligence is being used. Since compute is what it runs on, we can look at how much of it is being built for future needs. These bets are not cheap but they are being made because it seems clear that any bit of compute we build gets used up - even if it's just making your dog bald in a funny picture. The flexibility of using it to train the next models as well as running the current best ones is also a big plus. We really are so lucky to be here and watch it happen - or help build it.",

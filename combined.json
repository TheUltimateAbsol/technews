There was a lot of media coverage when Obama banned insider stock trading in 2012, but he really quietly reversed it just a year later with the help of the Republican led house. If you try to search for the STOCK Act you mostly get results celebrating the 2012 signing but nothing regarding the later modification unless you really narrow down your search. https://archive.ph/EhqA2 https://archive.ph/8Tiwv >A year ago, President Obama signed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act into law at a celebratory ceremony attended by a bipartisan cast of lawmakers.\\ \\ \"I want to thank all the members of Congress who came together and worked to get this done,\" he said.\\ \\ \u2026\\ \\ But on Monday, when the president signed a bill reversing big pieces of the law, the emailed announcement was one sentence long. There was no fanfare last week either, when the Senate and then the House passed the bill in largely empty chambers using a fast-track procedure known as unanimous consent.\\ \\ **In the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., shepherded the bill through. It was Friday afternoon at 12:52. Many members had already left for the weekend or were on their way out. The whole process took only 30 seconds. There was no debate.** That last bit is the most infuriating. Every bit of it. Them leaving work before 1pm on a Friday, votes after lots of people were gone, no debate, no discussion, no publicity.

This has been confirmed by my own family's experiences and by family and friends who are RNs, CNPs, and M.D.s. All of them are over 45 years old and say that medical care is nothing like it was when they were in med school. People got into the medical field who should never have and would have been screened out in years past. If you must be hospitalized, look for providers who are 50+ and white. Don't feel bad or guilty about asking for a second or third opinion until you get the providers you want. It's your care and totally up to you to dictate - NOT them.

We have been stuck around 100MB/s 4k throughput for a while but cheap drives can be as bad as half the performance here even when capable of 7000MB/s sequentially. The game file verification is limited by the algorithm Steam uses being quite lowly threaded, the same limitations occur in the update algorithm and the backup and restore functionality as well.",

With that such a niche sport, I would imagine there could be so much opportunity to explore a new, edgy, grungy, or fringe art style, to fit thematically with the off-the-wall idea that this game is in the first place. It also doesn't seem to have much variety in gameplay. Super bare bones looking software, where is the Nintendo charm?

        "text_content": "This is my concept for a potential \u201cWii Nintendo Classics\u201d addition to the Nintendo Switch Online subscription. The Wii is such a huge part of Nintendo\u2019s legacy that I think it will inevitably join the program, so this is my take on what I think they would offer as well as what I\u2019d hope to see! SELECTION OF INITIAL GAMES: A good variety of games including the mega hits such as \u2018Wii Sports\u2019 and \u2018Mario Kart Wii\u2019. Included \u2018The Legend of Zelda: Twighlight Princess\u2019 and \u2018Super Mario Galaxy 2\u2019 as to get a couple more 3D Zelda and 3D Marios playable on the system. There are so many amazing Wii games that are currently stuck on that system so this program would be amazing at finally replaying them. CONTROLLERS I think Nintendo should continue the tradition and offer a revamped Wii, Wii Sensor Bar, and Nunchuck. The technology is there to include gyro functionality in the shell of the original Wii Remote so no need for Wii Motion Plus, and the Wii Sensor Bar is dirt cheap to make so Nintendo could include it in every controller purchase. I also think Nintendo sees the nostalgic value in playing these games how they were intended to be played. Yes the Joy-Cons can operate with Wii Remote like functionality, however it is less than ideal. Still playable, but would have calibration issues in games such as the Metroid Prime Trilogy where aiming is constant. You can get around this if you include an extra input to \u201crecalibrate\u201d your aim to center, but the best solution would be offering an updated modern Wii controller setup. It\u2019s a Win Win since Nintendo can charge a premium for it making money and the fans get to play the games the way they were intended. VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS: This is a pipe dream since GameCube doesn\u2019t really offer anything special but alas. Would be great to see Nintendo put effort into this emulator and actually push these games to 4K. Unofficial emulators have managed this already and the Switch 2 has more than enough power to manage it. They could also improve the frame rates which would offer noticeable improvements to games such as Wii Sports, imagine playing that game at 120 fps for example, it wouldn\u2019t just look better but in some cases would improve gameplay itself as the higher your fps the better motion controls feel. ONLINE PLAY: Continue to offer this as part of the service however actually invest in dedicated servers so the latency is actually playable. This is probably the most unrealistic part of this whole mockup.",

        "score": 133,
        "text_content": "After the success of Mass Effect Legendary Edition, a lot of people wonder why Bioware/EA hasn't released a Dragon Age Legendary Edition yet. Well, according to former Bioware executive producer Mark Darrah, Bioware has already pitched a remake of Dragon Age Origins or a remastered collection of the Dragon Age trilogy (Origins, 2 and Inquisition) several times, but EA refused to fund it every single time. More specifically, he says EA is against remasters overall, and Dragon Age would be harder to do than Mass Effect. Bioware actually wants to do it, but EA refuses to give them more money, so Bioware would have to do it with the resources they already have. Unfortunately, they can't afford it at the moment since they are already working on Mass Effect 5.

Another thing we can talk about is Bioware as a studio because I feel like this is the result of years of bad direction and bad leaders within the company; after seeing the documentary that Mark Darrah made about the development of Anthem and comparing it with what Jason said in his Anthem report, I feel that Bioware was a studio, like Bungie, that had a lot of talent but never matured, they never got serious, they always chasing their own past successes to the point where that lack of growth and innovation made them what they are now, they always wanted to do what they did with Mass Effect 2 but they always fail. Can we blame EA for this? Yes, but we also can't ignore the role Casey Hudson played in all of this. He was the one who promised EA a live service, he was the one who diverted resources. And don't even mention how they design projects. Hell, even Dragon Age Origins had horror stories about its development.",

In addition to reprints of the existing 22 characters that were included in the Starter Set launched on June 5, [images show](https://images.nintendolife.com/634e26f1a6488/street-fighter-6.large.png) that they will also introduce new cards for the post-launch fighters included in Year 2 and Year 3 of DLC, which means everyone from Akuma to Ingrid will now be covered in the upcoming set. There's also [new packaging](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/street-fighter-6s-next-wave-of-amiibo-cards-surface-online-heres-a-look#enlarge-3) that prominently highlights A.K.I., M.

Amiibo cards can be used in *SF6* on Switch 2 to save player data such as character costumes and costume colors as well as control style preferences in addition to unlocking viewable Gallery items.

I\u2019ve messed around with every model under the sun and my take is that an AI can be \u201csuper intelligent,\u201d but if it continues to do dumb errors/hallucinations, its real world utility is cooked. Reliability is the whole game in the medical world. Putting benchmarks aside, GPT5 feels like a major step because the hallucination rate in thinking tasks actually dropped hard. Tool use is excellent, and the early wobble thing around \u201cwhen to think harder\u201d seems resolved. The contextual understanding jump is huge. Tokens per second is way up, and cost per intelligence is way down, which is nice. Smaller notes: image analysis is a minor improvement, sycophancy is moderately reduced, and coding is only a small lift overall except frontend work, which got a big upgrade. Most importantly for me, this is the first model where I\u2019d say its medical reasoning and clinical acumen are on par with mine. It would be a good buddy to have around to help with cases realtime if it passed privacy laws. That crosses a line from \u201cneat toy\u201d to \u201c2nd brain thats says less absurd things and can understand the whole case\" Cons: The context window is still small, and the personality\u2019s flatter. I get why people dislike that. But OpenAI has like 800M users where chasing raw \u201cintelligence\u201d without nailing accuracy, hallucination reduction, and alignment was never the move. This may look like a slowdown, but if you want a reasoning model at this level to be useful, these are the upgrades that matter. Also advanced voice mode still really sucks. Like its unusable. Grok has the best voice implemtation so far. For what it\u2019s worth, Claude Opus 4.1 is still better in a few areas, but it\u2019s significantly more expensive. GPT5 hits the reliability per dollar sweet spot right now. I think if there were zero releases from GPT4 to GPT5 we would be like wtf. However. the hype created high expectations so thats on them.",

It definitely feels like magic because whatever they did with the memory makes the model so much smarter. The more conversations that I have with it and the more things that we build together, it just seems to recall conversations better than before.

There is some nuance and inside the house of medicine that can be shouted about.

Yes, they\u2019ve made mistakes and done things worth criticizing, but I still don\u2019t understand this level of hate. I don\u2019t think the chart error in the GPT-5 presentation was as big of a deal as people made it out to be, and I believe they\u2019ll fix the transition issues with the new model in a few days. Their job is already difficult, going up against trillion-dollar companies without the same financial resources. It\u2019s like everyone is waiting for them to fall. As if all the other companies are innocent and only they are the devil. In my opinion, it\u2019s much better to have OpenAI competing rather than letting dominant companies like Meta and Google hold a monopoly. I think they\u2019ve done a good job so far. Also, unlike everyone else, I\u2019m satisfied with GPT-5. While GPT-4o had unique features, its constant praise, agreeing with me, and sycophantic personality really annoyed me. Also, they\u2019ve already added a personality selection feature for those who want it to be friendlier. I chose \u201cRobot,\u201d and for the first time, it doesn\u2019t use em dashes in its responses.",

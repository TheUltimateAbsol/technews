        "score": 22,
        "text_content": "SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain. The policy is already yielding results, including in areas such as etching, a critical chip manufacturing step that involves removing materials from silicon wafers to carve out intricate transistor patterns, sources said. China's largest chip equipment group, Naura, is testing its etching tools on a cutting-edge 7nm (nanometre) production line of SMIC, two sources said. The early-stage milestone, which comes after Naura recently deployed etching tools on 14nm successfully, demonstrates how quickly domestic suppliers are advancing. \"Naura's etching results have been accelerated by the government requiring fabs to use at least 50% domestic equipment,\" one of the people told Reuters, adding that it was forcing the company to rapidly improve. Advanced etching tools had been predominantly supplied in China by foreign firms such as Lam Research [(LRCX.O)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LRCX.O) [, opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LRCX.O) and Tokyo Electron [(8035.T)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/8035.T)[, opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/8035.T), but are now being partially replaced by Naura and smaller rival Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC) [(688012.SS)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/688012.SS) [, opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/688012.SS), sources say. Naura has also proven a key partner for Chinese memory chipmakers, supplying etching tools for advanced chips with more than 300 layers. It developed electrostatic chucks \u2014 devices that hold wafers during processing \u2014 to replace worn parts in Lam Research equipment that the company could no longer service after the 2023 restrictions, sources said. Naura filed a record 779 patents in 2025, more than double what it filed in 2020 and 2021, while AMEC filed 259, according to Anaqua's AcclaimIP database, and verified by Reuters. That's also translating into strong financial results. Naura's revenue for the first half of 2025 jumped 30% to 16 billion yuan. AMEC reported a 44% jump in first-half revenue to 5 billion yuan. Analysts estimate that China has now reached [roughly 50% self-sufficiency ](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-chinas-chip-equipment-manufacturing-sector-stacks-up-2025-05-13/)in photoresist-removal and cleaning equipment, a market previously dominated by Japanese firms, but now locally led by Naura. \"The domestic equipment market will be dominated by two to three major manufacturers, and Naura is definitely one of them,\" said a separate source.",

They earn money from the games we purchase from the one and only storefront on their respective platforms.

Month-over-month and year-over-year pending home sales rose in the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. November's REALTORS Confidence Index survey shows that 22% of NAR members expect an increase in buyer traffic over the next three months, up from 17% in October and down from 24% one year ago. Meanwhile, 18% expect an increase in seller traffic, up from 16% last month and down from 22% in November 2024. \"Homebuyer momentum is building. The data shows the strongest performance of the year after accounting for seasonal factors, and the best performance in nearly three years, dating back to February 2023,\" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. \"Improving housing affordability\u2013driven by lower mortgage rates and wage growth rising faster than home prices\u2013is helping buyers test the market.

If I only give a grand goal without detailed guidance, the code agent can easily go miles away and never come back to the right track, which wastes a lot of tokens and renders the whole project unrecognizable. For me, I can safely say that AI has written 99% of my code, but the effectiveness it brings is truly limited. By the way, I have recently started working on a code agent project for learning purposes. Once you understand the internal mechanism of a code agent, you realize there\u2019s no magic in it other than just pure engineering around file editing, grep, glob, and sometimes JSON repair.

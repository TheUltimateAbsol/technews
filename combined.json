How many Trump voters got blackpilled because of this seditious hag? She should be in prison. I'd be arresting thousands of Democrats every week if I were Trump.

If he ordered Smith to spy on Republican Senators, he needs to be criminally charged. And did Wray help him write that memo to Smith? As a reminder, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein issued two such memorandums to Robert Mueller. This was not a normal occurrence. The first memo was dated May 17, 2017, and outlined the scope of Team Mueller's authorized investigation in the broadest terms. The second memo, dated August 2, 2017 expanded Mueller's mandate beyond allegations of Russian election interference. \"Because of this second memo, Paul Manafort's lawyers moved to have his initial and the subsequent superseding indictments for business dealings years ago dismissed because, among other reasons, Mueller had no legal authority beyond probing Russian election interference in the 2016 election when he was appointed by Rosenstein on May 17, 2017.\" How many such memos did Garland send to Smith outlining what authority Smith had, and his scope of investigation?",

[The full transcript of Intel's earnings call](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC/earnings/INTC-Q3-2025-earnings_call-366977.html), timestamp 0:44:35: >**Question:** >Yeah, thanks, John. I wanted to follow up on the gross margin trajectory as 18A layers in. I know, you know, comparing it to probably the prior couple of nodes, not a great compare, but maybe to a successful one. When you say yields are in a good spot and improving, is there a way to think about where those 18A yields are versus a successful product that you've seen in your history and, you know, kind of thinking about how that layers in in the first half? >**Answer (CFO Zisner):** >Yeah, I would say in general, I'm not sure yields in older nodes have been a big focus of ours, quite honestly. We're blazing a new trail on this. Yields are, what I would say, the yields are adequate to address the supply, but they are not where we need them to be in order to drive the appropriate level of margins. By the end of next year, we'll probably be in that space. Certainly the year after that, I think they'll be in what would be kind of an industry-acceptable level on the yields. I would tell you on Intel 14A, we're off to a great start. If you look at Intel 14A in terms of its maturity relative to Intel 18A at that same point of maturity, we're better in terms of performance and yield. We're off to an even better start on Intel 14A. Funny how there's no numerical answer on how 18A yields compare to a previous product and then the CFO's quickly shifts to 14A. For reference, this is probably what the question expected: [the Intel chart](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfZptrDfS3Z7ApSphcRXai-728-80.png.webp) \\- y-axis has no numbers, no other nodes' yield plotted [a TSMC chart](https://www.dvhardware.net/article73608.html) \\- numbered axis, plots multiple nodes' yield [a TSMC chart](https://semiwiki.com/forum/threads/tsmc-discloses-n2-defect-density-lower-than-n3-at-the-same-stage-of-development.22699/) \\- y-axis has no numbers, plots multiple nodes' yield // Claiming to be better than older nodes, but with no actual data is maybe why yields won't reach an \"industry-acceptable level\" until 2027. As a reminder, Reuters' previous report: [Exclusive: Intel struggles with key manufacturing process for next PC chip, sources say | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/intel-struggles-with-key-manufacturing-process-next-pc-chip-sources-say-2025-08-05/) Again, Intel still has not provided an updated defect density on Intel 18A in now [**13 months** (and counting).](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-says-defect-density-at-18a-is-healthy-potential-clients-are-lining-up) Clearly Intel ***has*** 18A defect density data every quarter, but has decided to not make public updates. // 18A not having [any \"significant\" external customers](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1ma3kkw/intel_shares_its_foundry_has_zero_significant/) is quite unfortunate for margins. For reference, TSMC has [picked up **10 to 15 customers** on TSMC N2](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-amd-and-mediatek-reportedly-among-tsmcs-2nm-early-adopters-company-said-to-have-15-customers-lined-up-for-new-process-tech).",

They're where we want them to be at this point. We had a goal for the end of the year, and they're going to hit that goal. To be fully accretive in terms of the cost structure of Intel 18A, we need the yields to be better. That's like every process. That's what happens. It's going to take all of next year, I think, to really get to a place where that's the case.\" For Intel, 18A yields are now at a very low defect rate where manufacturing even some of the bigger dies is not a problem or financial burden. However, as every node, it matures over time where defect rates are constantly reduced to increase operating margin and reduce waste dies. Hence, Intel is still investing into the 18A refinement, and the node will stick for a very long time. The actual disclosure is significantly more optimistic than the OP article, although as usual, no actual defect density numbers or even a yield number+die size.",

            {
                "raw_content": "Fannie and Freddie have not engineered inflated home values. Inflated home values are due to policy set by our local and federal government. Not every borrower or property qualifies for an appraisal waiver. There are restrictions. Also, a percentage of those waivers are for properties that have recently been appraised and that recent appraisal will be used instead of ordering a new one. Algorithmic or automated appraisals rely on historical data for valuation. Its goal is predict what someone would pay for the home. With appraisers their goal is to find comps to value the home at the sales price or higher. In fact if an automated appraisal comes under the sales price then you would order an appraisal. Automated home values do decrease and appraisers can\u2019t always justify the price. Neither method is perfect, but perhaps a good method would be a combination of the two. The 2018 tariffs, the trade war that followed, and tax benefits in the 2017 tax cuts and jobs incentivizing investors to buy up existing homes are a big reason why home values have inflated so much. The tax benefits and tariffs increased demand on existing while tariffs inflated cost to build new. The BBB increases these incentives while the new tariffs and trade war will increase the cost to add new supply. These incentives are not enough for some investors at these prices so they are waiting for more distressed sellers and foreclosures which there will certainly be in the future. Our government uses taxes to influence investor behavior. Counties and cities should use real estate taxes to influence investors. Right now large landlords are lobbying and influencing people with propaganda to get rid of the real estate tax. This will only increase investor demand on housing during a period of increased foreclosures and distressed sellers. I would hate to see what prices will be on the other side of this recession should this happen. I expect existing home values will creep up to new build prices. States should implement a significant homestead exemption tax. Then localities should implement a split tax rate to incentivize investors to sell or to do something productive with their property. For example a vacant homes and land in cities should be tax at much higher rate than occupied properties. Short term rentals should be taxed higher as well.

If they do a new study with Suno V5, it's likely that 90% of the participants will not be able to tell the difference.",

I'd even go as far as 95%",

        "text_content": "Sony has launched the LYT-901, its first 200MP mobile camera sensor targeting 2026 flagship smartphones, featuring a 1/1.12-inch imaging surface with native 0.7\u03bcm pixels that support 2x2 (50MP) and 4x4 (12.5MP) pixel binning modes. The sensor integrates on-chip AI processing to handle the high data throughput and employs a hybrid HDR architecture combining Hybrid Frame-HDR with Dual Conversion Gain HDR to achieve >100dB dynamic range (~17 stops) while minimizing motion artifacts. Key capabilities include in-sensor zoom (ISZ) enabling 4x \u201chigh quality\u201d optical magnification with 4K/30fps video recording at full zoom, and all-pixel phase-detection autofocus across the entire sensor area. The LYT-901 is expected to debut in devices like the OPPO Find X9 Ultra and Vivo X300 Ultra, competing directly with Samsung\u2019s 200MP sensors. |Model |Sensor Size|Pixel Size|Resolution|4K fps|HDR Tech |UHCG|2-Layer| |-----------|-----------|----------|----------|------|------------|----|-------| |**LYT-901**|1/1.12\u201d |0.7\u03bcm |200MP |120 |HF-HDR + DCG|No |No | |LYT-900 |1/0.98\u201d |1.6\u03bcm |50MP |120 |DCG |No |No | |LYT-828 |1/1.28\u201d |1.22\u03bcm |50MP |120 |HF-HDR + DCG|Yes |No | |LYT-818 |1/1.28\u201d |1.22\u03bcm |50MP |120 |DCG |Yes |No | |LYT-T808 |1/1.43\u201d |1.12\u03bcm |52MP |120 |DCG |No |Yes | |LYT-808 |1/1.4\u201d |1.12\u03bcm |50MP |60 |DCG |No |No | |LYT-700 |1/1.56\u201d |1.0\u03bcm |50MP |60 |DAG |No |No | *All models feature All-pixel AF and LBMF (Less Blanking Multi Frame).

As I understand it from reading the FAQ I can transfer everything from the Switch 1 to the Switch 2 which I plan to do before Christmas Day so everything's all set up for them to play MarioKart (and any other games I grab) when they open it up. That'll also give me a chance to get an SD card in the new console and make sure it's working etc. My question is whether by doing that transfer anything will change on the Switch 1? That is if I do the transfer now and they go to play Switch 1 before Christmas will anything give the game away that I've bought them a Switch 2, will games or profiles be missing etc.? Sorry again for the niche question but I don't want to ruin the surprise and also don't want to spend a load of time of Christmas Day setting up a new console while the kids bounce around desperate to play on it. I'm old enough that when I got a console for Christmas you just plugged it in and off you went but I know that's not the World we live in now!",

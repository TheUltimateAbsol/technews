        "score": 40,
        "text_content": "The entire discussion around Metroid Prime 4 and the new character seems completely fabricated. IGN immediately started out with a large hit-piece against the game over this single character. Nintendo fans who have defended and up roared for the continuation and support for niche and somewhat hard-to-get-into games have nothing but disgust for Metroid Prime 4 attempting to do anything. I will not name the obvious Youtuber, but I think it's fair to say that if you're a Metroid fan and a fan of other sci-fi games, you'd also feel like me. Very VERY sad. Every internet space is a hellhole making fun of Mackenzie when his presence is not even large, and in fact - a great addition. I didn't see any of the reactions yet, just watched the overview trailer and the 20 minute gameplay segment from \"Press Start Australia,\" and thought \"wow. What a colorful cast. Reminds me of Aliens.\" The game looks like it has so much charm and life into it. From the world, the music, even the cutscene production looks so fantastic. Better than one's I have seen in other AAA games like God of War or Horizon. Yet, this game introduces a comic character, who only has so many lines until you leave, and that is enough for Youtubers to create entire \"crash-outs\" against this game. What about the few Metroid fans? This is already a niche sci-fi series, unlike other Nintendo IPs, yet other Nintendo fans are also ripping this game to shreds without a single thought of \"maybe this isn't for me.\" I find the entire behavior extremely rude and disingenuous. This character absolutely did not cause this much pain. We have already seen the game. It is colorful, big, open, and less \"scarily isolating\" than past entries. No one could possibly think this is surprising. Even during the treehouse footage, there was such a highlight on the Federation troopers with their unique dialogues and voice lines. If you wanted to indulge in the \"isolated experience,\" you are free to play the prior games. Metroid Dread is brilliant and it's right there, with a likely chance of a sequel coming soon. Games like this used to be extremely celebratory. To have Samus be more stoic than ever, escaping a planet to actually save people, rather than killing an entire planet's life, is extremely noble and reminds me of the best of sci-fi gaming, Halo. These stories mean so much to people and it's extremely rare to have these sci-fi stories come out today. Finally, this reminds of Aliens, and while Ripley may not have saved the team, it might be wonderful to see a character like Samus, heroically save the team and potentially save the planet (a different outcome compared to each game before). I am disappointed in all the hit-pieces, and rage baiting journalists / YouTubers. I can't wait to play this game, and I hope Retro Studios, and all the new developers feel proud about themselves for what may be such a fantastic experience and new perspective for the Metroid franchise. The studio has inspired my life so much and I thank them for all their work.

Interesting perspective - but I fail to see what aspects of physics/biology could not be simulated by a Turing machine.

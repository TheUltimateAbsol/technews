X925 is 15% - 50% smaller vs two competitors (Gary believes it's Apple A18 Pro & Qualcomm 8 Elite), when compared iso-process, no L2. 5. Branch prediction improvements in perf & power. [**See**](https://youtu.be/U1tPpV0RWNw?t=223) the reduction in branch mispredicts chart, down 20% \u2192 0% . 6.

Front-end: OOO window size: +25% increase, up to 2K instructions in flight; more insruction elimination in front of the core, for move-immediates & move-vectors; some other node-specific scaling for BW & latency 8. Back-end: L1 data cache is 2x larger (128KB); OOO window size +25% growth, improvements in data prefetchers & reduction in back-end stalls. [**See**](https://youtu.be/U1tPpV0RWNw?t=367) the reduction in back-end stalls chart, down 49% \u2192 0%, and replacement policy improvements. 9.

Great to see good perf jumps across each power level. >Through the C1-Ultra, Arm delivers a six-year trend of double-digit performance improvements \u2026 A big driver for this performance gain is delivered through double-digit IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) gains. I might assume +10% IPC to be realistic, but we'll see soon enough. EDIT: [\\+12% IPC on GB6.3, via pixel counting](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1nd4j0q/comment/nde64t5/).

Austin, TX, ranked second with 7.7 months' supply, as buyer demand has softened in the pandemic-era boomtown while the total number of for-sale homes skyrocketed. Another major Sunshine State metro, Orlando, notched the third-highest months of supply in the U.S. at 6.9. Four other metros earned the distinction of having elevated months of supply, including New York City (6.7), Jacksonville, FL (6.3), Tampa, FL (6.3), and Riverside (6.1), landing them in buyer's market field. https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/monthly-housing-report-august-2025-buyers-market-delistings/",

For people looking for a new apartment, the deals are even better. 6-8 weeks of free rent is standard with some even offering $500 - $1K gift cards in addition to reduced or waived application fees (things that aren't captured in these types of reports). I have seen a few new apartment buildings with empty parking lots in my neighborhood and less than 20% occupancy rate and I'm being very generous with that figure. Edit: Added a lot more words",

The findings suggest a major advance in anti-aging therapies in primates. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies have been tested in primates before, but this study introduced genetic (FOXO3) modification to the MSCs in order to make them resistant to cellular senescence. Long story short: they found plenty of evidence supporting systemic amelioration of aging (more than I care to summarize) with minimal side effects over 44 weeks of bi-weekly infusions. They also explicitly state in the discussion that they had the following objectives: (1) developing a universal, shelf-ready human stem cell product with enhanced safety and anti-aging efficacy. (2) Establishing a quantitative comprehensive assessment tool for primate multi-organ aging and its interventions. (3) Charting a translational medicine roadmap for future human aging interventions.",

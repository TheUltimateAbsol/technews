Though Apple had Rosetta when they switched from x86 to ARM, so they could probably do the same with RISC-V. The ISA itself can affect performance in terms of the functionality it offers to the programmer. But the ISA itself doesn't really _do_ anything. It's just a shared language between hardware and software. Software knows what instructions it can use, and hardware knows what instructions it has to support. As a simple example, suppose ISA X has `add` instructions while ISA Y has `add` and `mul` (i.e. \"multiply\") instructions. A processor that implements ISA Y would probably perform better because programmers could write a program that multiplies numbers by just using the `mul` instruction. If they tried to implement that same program for a processor that uses ISA X, they'd have to do multiplication in software, maybe by writing a function like `multiply(a, b)` that does repeated additions to compute `a*b`. Now all ISAs support basic operations. But they can differ in the advanced instructions they implement. For example, ARM processors can have what they call the [scalable vector extension](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Scalable%20Vector%20Extensions) (or SVE) which essentially gives programmers the ability to manipulate vector data at a fundamental level. Basically, the ISA can promise programmers cool instructions that let them use the processor to its full capabilities. But at the end of the day, it does come down to the microarchitecture: i.e. how the ISA is implemented in the chip. For example, Qualcomm Snapdragon and Apple A series chips are both mobile processors that use the ARM ISA but have different performance numbers. I could imagine if they switched to RISC V they might take a hit in performance if RISC V doesnt have cool instructions that can speed up benchmarks. And then if instead of native RISC V binaries they have to run through an emulation layer like Rosetta, thats even more of a performance hit.",

        "score": 78,
        "text_content": "WASHINGTON: [The United States will impose new tariffs](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/nvidia-aim-h200-chip-shipment-china-mid-february-5672831) on Chinese semiconductor imports but has delayed the move until June 2027, the Trump administration said on Tuesday, signalling an effort to preserve a fragile trade truce with Beijing. The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) said the tariffs would target Chinese \u201clegacy\u201d or older-technology chips, following a year-long investigation into what Washington called Beijing\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d push for dominance in the semiconductor industry. The tariff rate will be announced at least 30 days before taking effect. # SECTION 301 PROBE The decision stems from a so-called Section 301 investigation into unfair trade practices launched last year under former president Joe Biden. The probe found that China\u2019s state-backed expansion of chipmaking capacity burdens US commerce and is therefore \u201cactionable\u201d under trade law, the USTR said. While keeping the option to levy duties, the administration opted to delay implementation until mid-2027. Officials said the timing would allow Washington to maintain leverage without derailing broader negotiations with Beijing. China\u2019s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. # TRADE TRUCE CONSIDERATIONS The delay comes as the US seeks to ease tensions following China\u2019s restrictions on exports of rare earth metals, which are critical to global technology supply chains and are largely controlled by Beijing. As part of efforts to keep talks on track, Washington has also pushed back a rule that would have further restricted US technology exports to units of already-blacklisted Chinese firms. In parallel, the administration has launched a review that could allow shipments to China of Nvidia\u2019s second-most powerful artificial intelligence chips, Reuters has reported, despite opposition from US lawmakers who warn such sales could boost China\u2019s military capabilities.",

        "text_content": "[Source (in Polish).](https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk) Seen this news circulate in Polish gaming press for quite a few days now, but haven't seen it being picked up anywhere else so I thought I might just as well share it here. It's particularly interesting because it's based on Noble Securities (Polish brokerage house) report, not yet another Borys and Rock podcast, even if ultimately it is a bunch of educated guesses. Below is the translation done with DeepL (sorry, couldn't be bothered to spend entire evening on this and DeepL is good enough for this): > **The release of the expansion pack for \u201cThe Witcher 3\u201d is scheduled for May 2026, according to Noble's analyst, who recommends accumulating CD PROJEKT shares.** > Mateusz Chrzanowski, an analyst at Noble Securities, has updated the schedules and budgets for CD Projekt's flagship projects in his latest report. He anticipates a paid add-on for The Witcher 3 in May 2026 and the release of The Witcher 4 in Q4 2027, along with a significant increase in production and marketing costs for the entire trilogy. Further down the line, there will be the cyberpunk \u201cOrion\u201d with a multiplayer component, and reshuffles at \u2018Sirius\u2019 and \u201cCanis Majoris.\u201d All this will take place amid market competition with \u201cGTA VI.\u201d > The Noble Securities report was made public on December 16, shortly after Strefa Inwestor\u00f3w published an interview with Mateusz Chrzanowski, in which he revealed some details of his assumptions. Among other things, he suggested that one of CD Projekt's unannounced projects was DLC for The Witcher 3, which would serve as a bridge between the final part of the previous trilogy and the new opening of the saga, with the simultaneous launch of The Witcher 4 campaign. > ___ > **Paid add-on for \u201cThe Witcher 3\u201d in May 2026 and kick-off of marketing for \u201cW4\u201d.** > An analyst at Noble Securities expects a strong focus on the release of The Witcher 4 in the middle of next year. > \u201cWe expect another paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026. We anticipate sales of 11 million copies at USD 30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million. The release should kick off the actual marketing campaign for The Witcher 4,\u201d the report reads. > The analyst also estimates smaller, undisclosed projects for next year. > \u201cWe estimate the budget for other undisclosed projects that may debut next year at PLN 28 million, and potential sales revenue for next year at PLN 61 million,\u201d the report also states. > ___ > **The Witcher 4 at the end of of 2027 and a higher price tag for the trilogy.** > Following statements by the company's management that The Witcher 4 will not be released before 2027, Noble Securities has extended its production cycle estimates by one year and now expects the game to be released in Q4 2027. > \"The extension and structure of current development expenditures have prompted us to increase the estimated budget for the game to PLN 1.4 billion (and the same amount for marketing). However, considering that the subsequent parts will be heavily based on W4 technology, the total budget for the trilogy has increased from PLN 2.1 billion to PLN 3.2 billion. There may also be synergies between marketing campaigns resulting from the concentration of releases (the management board wants to release the entire new trilogy within six years) and brand recognition, which would result in lower sales costs compared to the model based on CP77 expenses,\" the report states. > ___ > **Orion with multiplayer \u2013 premiere on the 10th anniversary of CP77.** > Regarding the sequel to Cyberpunk, Noble Securities points out that the team working on the project as part of the studio's second key franchise consists of 135 people and is expected to double in size within two years. > \u201cThe desire to integrate multiplayer mode into the production prompted us to extend the production time beyond the state resulting from the progress of work on the benchmark W4. As a result, the budget has grown to PLN 1.5 billion, and we expect the release in Q4 2030 (the 10th anniversary of CP77),\u201d the report continues. > ___ > **Sirius, Canis Majoris, and Hadar \u2013 shifts and reorganization in the pipeline.** > Noble Securities analysts do not see any breakthroughs in additional projects. > \"As for progress on other projects, there are still no breakthroughs in sight. The number of developers working on Sirius/Hadar increased by 14/11 people at the turn of the year. Meanwhile, the Fool's Theory team working on The Witcher 1 remake has been moved to support W4, from which it will draw assets. As a result, we are postponing the release dates of Sirius and Canis Majoris (W1 remake) by one year (2028). We have also lowered the price of both games by $10 and the expected production budget by PLN 50 million. Hadar remains in the pre-concept phase, so based on the duration of the conceptual work in the case of Orion, we are postponing the debut by 2 years (2032),\" the report states. > ___ > **\u201cThe battle for supremacy with GTA VI\u201d.** > The broker's analyst places \u201cThe Witcher 4\u201d in the broader context of market forces. > \"The gaming market is awaiting the release of the next installment of the GTA series, which is currently scheduled for November 19, 2026. In addition to rumors of a possible price hike for the game, which is a benchmark for other AAA productions, investors may also see confirmation of an upward shift in the ceiling for game sales volume. This would confirm the trend seen on Steam, where the biggest hits are reaching ever higher maximum player peaks. In the Golden Joystick Awards 2025, The Witcher 4 lost by only 2 percentage points to GTA VI in the competition for the title of the most anticipated game, which illustrates the scale of the brand's development and its potential,\" the report concluded. > ___ > **What does this mean for investors?** > In the short term, DLC for \u201cW3\u201d potentially in May 2026 and smaller projects (PLN 61 million in potential revenue) may \u201ckeep the fire burning\u201d before the release of \u201cW4\u201d and help achieve the financial goals of the incentive program. > In the medium term, the release of \u201cW4,\u201d potentially in Q4 2027, and larger budgets (PLN 1.4 billion for production plus approximately PLN 1.4 billion for marketing) \u2013 a significant increase in scale, but also in sales expectations. > In the long term: the cyberpunk \u201cOrion\u201d (Q4 2030) with a multiplayer component and the postponed \u201cSirius,\u201d \u201cCanis Majoris\u201d (2028) and \u201cHadar\u201d (2032). The pipeline is long with significant expenditures. Campaign synergies and the technological base of \u201cThe Witcher 4\u201d may amortize the costs of subsequent releases. > Noble Securities paints a picture of a \u201cbigger but later\u201d CD Projekt with a strong \u201ccommercial bridge\u201d in the form of potential DLC for \u201cThe Witcher 3\u201d in mid-2026, a big bet on The Witcher 4 with a potential release at the end of 2027, and the ambitious, multiplayer, cyberpunk Orion with a potential release at the end of 2030. Timeliness, budget control, and the ability to monetize the brand in competition with GTA VI will be key for the market.",

        "score": 59,
        "text_content": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-23/luxury-apartments-are-bringing-rent-down-in-austin-denver Rents got cheaper in several major cities this past year, thanks to an influx of luxury apartment buildings opening their doors and luring tenants to vacate their old homes. But those looking for bargains will have to be quick, since the available apartments won\u2019t last long, developers say. The US\u2019s average rental rate fell 0.18 percent in November, the largest monthly drop in more than 15 years, according to real estate research firm CoStar. Driving that decline: lower rents in big cities like Austin, Denver and Phoenix, as well as vacation destinations like Naples, Florida; Asheville, North Carolina; and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. New building openings are bringing rents down as wealthy tenants trade up, forcing landlords to drop prices for older apartments. Rents for older units have fallen as much as 11%, and some are now on offer at rates as low as homes that are usually designated as \u201caffordable\u201d and come with restrictions including rent control and rent stabilization. The changed dynamic in the rental market is challenging the idea that luxury housing doesn\u2019t help the broader ecosystem. \u201cWhat it shows you is that housing supply reduces the cost of rent,\u201d said Sharon Wilson G\u00e9no, president of the National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade group representing landlords, investors and developers. The surprising decline in the midst of a historic housing crisis is another effect of the Covid-19 pandemic, when a freeze in economic activity prompted the Federal Reserve to lower rates just as remote work was causing a spike in home prices. As office workers fled to the likes of Miami and Nashville, developers sprang into action, starting new projects in cities they identified as the most desirable for this wave of migrants \u2014 most of which are in Sun Belt states. By 2024, these cities were experiencing a peak in new luxury apartment openings. In Austin, more than 10,000 new apartments opened to renters in the three months ending September last year. Phoenix topped out at nearly 8,000 new units before the end of the year. Denver\u2019s peak was slightly earlier, with more than 5,000 units opening up at the beginning of 2024. The cities where older buildings\u2019 rents fell the most saw new apartments built at a much higher rate than the national average. In the cities that added new apartments at lower rates \u2014 below the national average \u2014 rents barely budged. The cause of the rent declines could not be clearer, analysts say. \u201cThis is a generational development cycle,\u201d said Grant Montgomery, the national director of multifamily analytics at CoStar. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a peak like this since the mid-1980s.\u201d The supply of luxury buildings over the past couple of years has driven down rents and helped ease some of the affordability issues in those cities even though the development of affordable housing was comparatively slow, amounting to hundreds rather than thousands of new units built per quarter. \u201cMore supply is the answer to housing affordability. I think people don\u2019t believe that,\u201d added G\u00e9no, of the NMHC. To be sure, relying on luxury developments to address the housing crisis isn\u2019t a long-term solution \u2014 with developers already pulling back on plans for new buildings in places where rents have fallen the most. The number of new apartments opening for rent across the country is expected to drop by half next year from its mid-2024 peak. Camden Property Trust, which owns nearly 60,000 units, is among operators who have cited new supply as a key reason for lowering rents. Its focus was on \u201coccupancy instead of rental increases,\u201d Chairman Ric Campo told investors on a November conference call. Still, Campo predicted that tighter supply will eventually allow developers to begin raising rents again. \u201cApartments and our shares are on sale, but not for much longer,\u201d he said.",

        "text_content": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-23/portugal-home-prices-surge-18-biggest-jump-since-records-began Home prices in Portugal posted another record jump in the third quarter, with the deepening housing squeeze fast becoming one of the country\u2019s biggest political flashpoints. The average price for a dwelling rose 17.7% from a year earlier, according to the National Statistics Institute. It\u2019s the biggest increase since the agency began tracking the data in 2009, and the third record in a row. Existing homes drove much of the surge in the third quarter, with prices climbing 19.1% year on year \u2014 outpacing the broader market. The figures add to the pressure on Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro to confront a deepening affordability crisis fueled by record immigration, constrained supply and a decade-long erosion in access to housing. Portugal saw the steepest decline in affordability across the OECD in the past ten years, as home prices outstripped wage growth. Social housing accounts for just 1.1% of the housing stock, one of the lowest shares in the bloc. There were a record 1.5 million foreigners residing in Portugal in 2024, accounting for about 15% of the country\u2019s total population. Montenegro\u2019s center-right government has pledged roughly \u20ac1.2 billion in 2026 to tackle the crunch and plans income-tax cuts aimed at easing the burden on lower-income families. It also secured a \u20ac1.34 billion loan from the European Investment Bank to build and renovate about 12,000 homes nationwide to be rented at affordable rates \u2014 a rare boost to supply in a market desperately short of it.",

The \"wrong\" thing can refer to morally wrong things, but even more fundamentally it could even be learning to lose its self preservation or its fundamental abilities (like what if it learns to override its own code/memory?). Humans (and animals) have a self preservation instinct. It's hard to teach a human that the right thing to do is fling itself off a cliff with no safety equipment for example. This is true even if the human didn't understand gravity or physics of impact forces. But AI doesn't have that instinct, so it needs to calculate that \"oh this action will result in my destruction so I'll not learn it.\" However, if it's something new, then the AI won't know that the action will lead to its destruction.

If OpenAI or whatever suddenly folded, the world would still have Stable Diffusion, Deepseek, Mistral, LLaMA 3 etc all that stuff that can be easily downloaded and run offline on computers. Not to mention the huge promise of building robots and sending them to dangerous jobs like the military, firefighting, mining etc. The last part would even be funded by the governments if they have to. If one country gets fully functional military robots then conflicts like the Ukraine/Russia war would now be over in a day.",

I don't always agree with his views, but I can at least understand the logic of how he got there. I'll address the first major point in his blog post here. > Currently the labs are trying to bake in a bunch of skills into these models through \u201cmid-training\u201d - there\u2019s an entire supply chain of companies building RL environments which teach the model how to navigate a web browser or use Excel to write financial models. > Either these models will soon learn on the job in a self directed way - making all this pre-baking pointless - or they won\u2019t - which means AGI is not imminent. Humans don\u2019t have to go through a special training phase where they need to rehearse every single piece of software they might ever need to use. This implies (intentional or not) that these labs are ONLY focused trying to bake in specific skills. The reality is that they are doing a mixed approach of 1) adding scale and baking in new skills and 2) testing new algorithms/architectures and trying to solve things like continuous learning. However scaling and baking new skills is much easier to do and the results are more predictable, so it's no surprise that that is what gets released and what we hear about. Yes, maybe it would be more efficient if we focused 100% of our capabilities on task 2 and trying to jump straigh to AGI, but it seems almost impossible to me for these companies to ignore activities that they KNOW can improve current models.",

Karpathy thinks continual learning is needed for AGI. Sutskever thinks continual learning is equivalent to ASI. The lines between AGI and ASI semantics have been blurred so most people are just talking past each other at this point.",

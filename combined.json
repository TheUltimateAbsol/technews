It's wrong, it's wrong on so many levels but yet people hear and see what they want to even if Trump himself says otherwise. In my opinion this is completely unacceptable. I don't get it, there are so many good actual American workers out there. But people will just say \" Trump isn't doing that,that's not the case\" and move on, even though it is the case. It is the same thing happening in the Countries we make fun of like the UK or Germany. We laugh but our own leader is doing this to us, not even hiding it just using the fact that people will say, \"No, that cannot be true, I heard him say otherwise\". I honestly don't know what to believe anymore when it comes to trusting these people we are supposed to trust. I am completely jaded but if you pay attention,you would be too.

The driver failed to stop, and a high-speed vehicle pursuit ensued. The vehicle came to a stop, and several passengers started to flee on foot. With the assistance from the DPS Brush Team and Border Patrol, 11 illegal immigrants were located and apprehended. During the investigation, DPS learned that the driver, Nicolas Alejandro Ramirez Reyes, 24, of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, was arrested by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in 2022 for marijuana distribution. In 2024, after serving 24 months in prison, he was removed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Ramirez Reyes was arrested and charged with smuggling of persons and evading arrest. He was transported to the Webb Co. Jail with an ICE detainer as a deported criminal/aggravated felon. All 11 illegal immigrants, also from Mexico, were referred to Border Patrol. (TXDPS / News release)",

Penalize confident errors more than you penalize uncertainty, and give partial credit for appropriate expressions of uncertainty. This idea is not new. Some standardized tests have long used versions of negative marking for wrong answers or partial credit for leaving questions blank to discourage blind guessing. Several research groups have also explored evaluations that account for uncertainty and calibration. Sounds like the incredibly most obvious solution that everyone has probably thought about to reduce hallucinations > Our point is different. It is not enough to add a few new uncertainty-aware tests on the side. The widely used, accuracy-based evals need to be updated so that their scoring discourages guessing. If the main scoreboards keep rewarding lucky guesses, models will keep learning to guess. Fixing scoreboards can broaden adoption of hallucination-reduction techniques, both newly developed and those from prior research. But I'm reading this correctly, it sounds like they're saying that it's not enough for *some* evals to be made to target hallucinations, but rather *all* evals need to. The existence of some (many) evals that incentivize guessing will have a measurable impact on making models hallucinate. &nbsp; Edit: Reading So essentially state the obvious \"no shit, if you penalize uncertain answers, the models will hallucinate more\", and basically state how partially it's the fault of AI labs benchmaxing, because almost all existing benchmarks mark incorrect answers the same as \"I don't know\". Since the VAST MAJORITY of benchmarks are misaligned for hallucination reduction, it doesn't matter if they then make a couple of benchmarks that reduce hallucinations. They also state that \"avoiding errors\" is much harder than \"identifying errors\" (again this is obvious, but reading between the lines, there were rumours of OpenAI making a universal verifier, which makes sense when they say it's easier to verify)",

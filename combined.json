These numbers have been shown in the opening text, an interview, and a reveal trailer. The Prime series, which is canon, is a separate sub series within the overall Metroid saga. Generally, Metroid fans don't use the internal numbered names to refer to games, aside from II. We'll usually just say \"Fusion\", or \"Dread\", but we don't really say \"Metroid 4\". If we refer to Metroid Prime 4, we'll probably just say \"Prime 4\". This isn't really an issue mind you, but I notice a lot saying \"Metroid 4\" when referring to Prime 4, and just thought I'd help clarify that \"Metroid 4\" is already used by Fusion. So when Metroid 6 is announced, I hope you don't think \"Wait, 4 was the last one, where's 5?\" lol.

We knew about the work on a potential new expansion behind the scenes a long time ago. We don't want to give exact dates to protect our sources, but the topic appeared on our radar years ago. Our informant \u2013 a person who has repeatedly provided us with reliable behind-the-scenes information \u2013 confirmed at the time that a new expansion was in the works, albeit at a very early stage. So why didn't we write about it? Although it was reliable, it was information from only one source. We decided that it wasn't enough to get your hopes up based on a single signal. However, what we heard later behind the scenes and what resulted from our internal analysis of that period is important here. All of this sheds completely new light on today's speculation. At the time, we were receiving signals that the team was fascinated by a completely different direction than the frozen north. There were many indications that the developers were keenly interested in exploring >!Zerrikania!<. Many years have passed since we first heard about the DLC and came to the conclusion that it would most likely take us to the desert. The studio's internal plans may have changed many times, and the folder labeled >!Zerrikania!< may have been replaced with one labeled \u201cKovir\u201d or something else entirely. However, considering how convinced our sources were about the work on \u201csomething new\u201d years ago, and how often the topic of the east appeared in our analyses and sources, we cannot ignore this lead. Since our information about preliminary work on the expansion (now confirmed by analysts and insiders) is proving to be increasingly likely, perhaps our information about its location also has some truth to it? \"",

I\u2019m very curious how big this ends up being. Since Blood and Wine could almost have been a stand-alone title, getting another similarly-sized expansion would be absolutely insane so many years from when it seemed like major new content had stopped. I\u2019d be happy even with a smaller, more self-contained DLC like Hearts of Stone, so anything beyond that is almost crazy to think about. I\u2019m also very curious *what* the DLC is if it really is meant to tie TW3 to TW4. Is there a big time jump? Will it be directly integrated into the base game like the other expansions or put into a separate world and save file? Are we even going to play as Geralt?",

Now if it's what they say remains to be seen. I think it would probably more deserve its full game (it's supposed to be huge). In fact that's where I hoped TW4 would have gone instead of Kovir but I guess TW5 and 6 might still do it.",

LiS 1 had its share of cringy dialog and whatnot, but it was a very touching choose-your-own-adventure game with a lot of heart. It\u2019s a very nostalgic game for me; they really captured that feeling of being a dumb teenager trying to figure out life while clinging onto the remnants of your childhood. Before the Storm was so-so. An alright prequel for diehard fans of the first game, but a lot of the creative decisions are questionable and it didn\u2019t really advance the universe\u2019s plot forward in any way. Then they just really fucked up with the sequel. I was happy with the initial concept of making the franchise more of an anthology series with different casts and different powers, but from almost everything I\u2019ve heard, LiS2 just failed to provide a similarly endearing cast or memorable story as the original. It reviewed poorly and made far less of a splash than the original. Then Dontnod left the series and some other dudes took over. They put out True Colors, which reviewed fairly well but arguably had even less impact than the second game. And now that the \u201cfranchise\u201d (or attempted franchise, more accurately) is on life support, they seemingly scrapped the whole anthology idea and trudged out Max again to make a nostalgia bait mess of a game that just managed to piss off fans of the first game. As far as I\u2019m aware, Double Exposure was just an utter flop by any metric. Seriously, I know they signed some sort of agreement to make a sequel to Double Exposure, but I really, really wish they\u2019d just let this series die. They had one really good game and then simply weren\u2019t able to expand upon it and make it into a successful series.

        "score": 127,
        "text_content": "# What is an Erdos Problem? As you may or may not know, yesterday was the first time an Erdos Problem (a type of open mathematics problem) was resolved by an LLM that wasn't previously resolved by a human, in this case GPT-5.2. I'm writing this post to explain our experience dealing with open problems using LLMs as well as the workflow that led to this correct proof, all in hopes it will assist those trying the same thing (as I know there are), or even AI companies with tweaking their models towards research mathematics. # LLMs Dealing with Open Problems I've been giving many Erdos problems to LLMs for quite some time now which has led us to understand the current capabilities of LLMs dealing with them (Gemini 2.5 Deep Think at that time). I started by simply giving a screenshot of the problem as stated on the [erdosproblems.com](http://erdosproblems.com) website and telling it to resolve it, however immediately ran into a barrier arising from the model's ability to access the internet. Deep Think searching the internet to assist solving, led the model to realise it's an open problem, which in turn prompted the model to explain to us that it believes this problem is still open and therefore cannot help. It would explain the problem statement as well as why the problem is so difficult. So long story short, it doesn't believe it can solve open problems whatsoever, and therefore will not try. The simple solution to this was to revoke its internet access, thereby allowing the model to actually attempt to solve the problem. The prompt given was something along the lines of \"This is a complex competition style math problem. Solve the problem and give a rigorous proof or disproof. Do not search the internet\". This seemed to eliminate that barrier for the most part, but sometimes even without access to the internet, the model recognized the problem and thus knew it be open, but it was rare. After all of that I ran into a second barrier, hallucinations. # Hallucinations This was the barrier that was basically inescapable. Giving these models an Erdos problem along with restricting its internet access would allow it to properly answer, however the solutions it gave were wildly incorrect and hallucinated. It made big assumptions that were not proved, fatal arithmetic errors etc. which basically made me stop, realising it was probably a lost cause. Along came Gemini 3 Pro, which after some testing suffered from the same hallucination issue; this was also the case for Gemini 3 Deep Think when it became available. # GPT-5.2 - The Saviour When GPT-5.2 came out we were quite excited, as the benchmarks looked very promising in terms of Math and general reasoning. In our testing, it truly lived up to the hype, especially in it's proof writing capabilities. This prompted me to start giving the model Erdos problems again. The truly great part of this model was its honesty. Most of the time it would complete the majority of the proof and say something along the lines of \"Here is a conditional proof. What I *couldn't* do is prove Lemma X as \\**explains difficulty*\\*.\" This was such a breath of fresh air compared to Gemini making some nonsense up, and mostly the parts that were written from 5.2 were correct; perhaps some minor fixable errors. The difference between Gemini and GPT-5.2 was night and day. # GPT-5.2 Solving Erdos #333 and #728 When we first resolved Erdos problem #333 with GPT 5.2 Pro we were very excited, as at that point it was the first time an LLM resolved an Erdos problem not previously resolved by a Human. However, we came to find out the problem actually HAD been resolved in literature from a long time ago as was not known. So at the very least, we brought that solution to light. # The Final Workflow Now onto **#728, the ACTUAL first time.** I will explain, in detail, the workflow that led to a correct proof resolving the problem. 1. GPT-5.2 with internet access was given a single prompt such as \"Research Erdos problem #728 to understand what the problem is really asking. Next, brainstorm some novel/creative ideas that could lead to a correct proof or disproof. Lastly, craft a short latex prompt I can give to an LLM that would lead to a rigorous proof or disproof using the idea/method you have chosen. Make NO MENTION of it being an Erdos or open problem.\" This step usually took anywhere from 8-15 minutes. 2. This prompt was then given to a separate instance of GPT-5.2 Thinking along with \"Don't search the internet\" 3. The proof it outputted seemed correct to me (I'm not a mathematician by trade but I know what bullshit looks like). 4. I then gave that proof to another instance of 5.2 Thinking, which claimed it was almost correct with one slight error, which it then fixed. Alongside the fix was this note, which is very interesting and cool, as I had never seen a comment like this before. https://preview.redd.it/d096pwus90cg1.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=57eec467a26ef15e9f6f42933a66a5de360d0b81 5. It was at this point that I passed the argument to Acer (math student, AcerFur on X) and he also agreed it looked plausible. He took that argument and passed it through GPT-5.2 Pro to translate to Latex and fix any minor errors it could find, which it did easily and quickly. 6. Acer then gave Harmonic's Aristotle the latex proof to auto formalise to Lean, and about 8 hours later outputs the code. This code had some warnings, although still compiles, that were easily fixable using Claude Opus 4.5 (the only LLM semi-competent in Lean 4). 7. Acer commented this solution on the #728 page on [erdosproblems.com](http://erdosproblems.com) for peer review. The problem was quite ambiguous so mathematician Terence Tao labelled it as a partial solution, whilst explaining what Erdos probably intended the problem to be asking. 8. I then fed the proof to a new instance of GPT-5.2 Thinking asking to update it to account for this specific constraint, which within a minute it did correctly. Interestingly enough, almost simultaneous to giving the proof back to 5.2, Tao commented that changing a specific part of the proof could work, which was the exact thing GPT-5.2 suggested and subsequently did. 9. This final proof was formalised with Aristotle once again, commented on the #728 page and thereby resolving the problem. https://preview.redd.it/lvf1ui6jc0cg1.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a1b23472fc4577a1920ab8a0d08b614582eb4b5 # Conclusion At this point in time, there has been no literature found that resolved this problem fully, although the argument used was similar in spirit to the Pomerance paper. Tao's GitHub page regarding AI's contributions to Erdos Problems now includes both our #333 and novel #728 proofs, with the comment about Pomerance similarity. Hopefully this explanation leads to someone else doing what we have.

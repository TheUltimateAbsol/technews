The cache looks in its list of memory locations it has cached and responds with the data immediately if it finds it, or loads it from main memory into the cache, and passes the data back to the CPU when the data is ready. It's not possible to point at the cache because hardware designers don't want software developers to have to worry about it. The cache guesses what data it should keep around, and it might guess wrong. You might be able to do better, but if CPU architects gave you control, you would have to write a different program for every CPU with a different cache size and make an update when new CPUs come out.",

They're mainly looking for your thought process, but something important to keep in mind is that if your machine is not caching anything, it will still be completely fine functionally. It will just be much slower. So you're not looking for errors or functional mismatches, you're looking for the right uarch functionality (what is cached), right structures (keep track of where things are), and the right replacement policy (when things are cached or replaced). Then you observe performance. Obviously it's deeper than that in reality, but you could be so in the weeds in cache coherency nonsense or a data/instruction cache discussion and never realize that it could fail in various ways that would never really break the machine. That's what the interviewer is looking for usually, they're hoping to see you break out of that rabbit hole.",

        "text_content": ">I was talking about PlayStation doing day-and-day and doing PC. And then I got off on a tangent about the social aspects of PlayStation. And the reason Steam has become popular is because, at least partially I think, it is easier to go viral with Steam. And you would think logically that PlayStation would want to tap into that, right? And make their franchises go viral by being on Steam and being on a bigger platform. \\[...\\] But I actually heard the complete opposite today from a very good source, that PlayStation probably is pulling back from PC and also that the crossbuy buttons and the PlayStation/PC iconography is from outdated old builds and is never going to be used. \\[...\\] I don't actively investigate what PlayStation's doing. Because it's not my beat. But I do get PlayStation information incidentally sometimes by researching Microsoft stuff for my actual beat. But it does seem like the games that PlayStation released on PC didn't move the needle for them at all. Partially because they were launched so late, but maybe they've used that as evidence that they shouldn't go any further, and that they should remain more Nintendo in their approach and keep things more exclusive. Except service games. \\[...\\] But I do think those sort of tentpole singleplayer games like Yotei and stuff, maybe they just don't come to PC, or they come to PC years later.

        "text_content": "1. Run the numbers, not your emotions. A property can be beautiful, but if it doesn\u2019t make money, it\u2019s just an expensive hobby. Always let the math guide your decisions. 2. Buy for value, not hype. Just because everyone\u2019s chasing the latest hot market doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a smart buy. If a deal only works in a perfect world, it\u2019s not worth the risk. 3. Location is everything. You can renovate a home, but you can\u2019t change its neighborhood. A strong area can make an average property shine, while a weak one can drag down even the nicest house. 4. Never underestimate expenses. Roofs leak, tenants move out, repairs happen. Bad investors guess; smart investors plan and budget for the unexpected. 5. Be patient, not desperate. Feeling like you\u2019re \u201cbehind\u201d is a fast track to mistakes. Real estate rewards discipline and timing, not panic. 6. Treat tenants like people, not problems. Happy tenants pay on time, stay longer, and take care of your property. Respect goes a long way. 7. Know your financing as well as your property. Interest rates, loan terms, and leverage often matter more than a fancy kitchen. A smart loan can make a mediocre property shine. 8. Think long-term, not quick flips. Fast money is tempting but fleeting. True wealth comes from steady cash flow, growing equity, and smart leverage. 9. Don\u2019t compare your journey to anyone else\u2019s. Some start with millions, some with nothing. Focus on your own path and progress at your own pace. 10. Never stop learning. Markets change, laws evolve, and strategies shift. The investor who stops learning will eventually stop earning.",

        "text_content": "Good morning Chair and Delegation. I'm a third-generation proud American, single senior, 40-year Florida year round resident homeowner and business owner, currently representing myself pro se in an appellate case documenting systematic fraud in my HOA foreclosure. I'm here about a simple disparity: Florida condo owners have ombudsman protection. Florida HOA homeowners pay property taxes but have no protection. Municipalities outsourced infrastructure to HOAs claiming it would keep property taxes low. Our property taxes went up anyway. Florida HOA homeowners are paying twice\u2014HOA assessments plus rising taxes\u2014with no representation. Avoiding regulation is a serious problem because Homeowners Associations are no longer about homeowners. Homeowner Associations have been consolidated by private equity companies. This industry has fundamentally changed. Morgan Stanley Capital Partners acquired RowCal in 2023\u2014refusing to disclose the purchase price. Multiple PE firms have consolidated Florida HOA management companies. The Riva on the River lawsuit is challenging earned credits\u2014where management companies receive payments from banks based on HOA deposit portfolios totaling over $106 billion nationally. This is homeowner money being used to pay Wall Street. These are public, verifiable facts. 3.9 million Florida HOA homeowners face foreclosure over assessment disputes because of no state oversight. Foreclosure mills are a profit model designed to thrive without regulation, without enforcement, without oversight. Community managers are the ones held responsible, but they are not the decision profit makers. There's no regulatory protection, no appeals process, no ombudsman. It\u2019s all on the Florida HOA homeowner to fight disputes and pay court costs out of pocket because there is no state agency regulating HOAs for Florida homeowners. I've provided detailed reform proposals to Jeremy Miller, including creation of an HOA ombudsman program modeled on the successful condo program. Florida HOA Homeowners are passengers on the Titanic. The daily calls to your offices verify \u2013 ICEBERG STRAIGHT AHEAD. Why are you frozen to act? Thank you for your time. Any comments from the community?",

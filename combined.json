However, to maximise profits, Samsung Device Solutions' Memory division, which makes DRAM chips, rejected the long-term supply deal. 3. Due to the ongoing AI boom, the demand for DRAM and HBM memory chips has increased exponentially.

I don\u2019t work for Valve, but I\u2019m at a major AI/ML lab that partnered with them on the tech for Half-Life 3. The game is absolutely coming, and the announcement is imminent. >The breakthrough Valve was waiting for was the ability to handle physics\u2014specifically fluids and destruction\u2014using machine learning instead of expensive deterministic calculations. Put simply, Valve has integrated a pipeline into Source 2 that allows them to brute-force high-fidelity simulations to build ground-truth datasets. These datasets train models to predict physics interactions rather than compute them raw. >Think movie-quality water simulations, 1:1 structural destruction, and complex vehicle physics, all running smoothly on a mid-tier GPU. The hardware isn't solving the heavy math; it\u2019s just making efficient ML predictions via pre-trained models. Half-Life 3 is effectively the tech demo for this advancement. It allows developers to create experiences with 100x the physical interactivity at less than 1% of the historical compute cost. It\u2019s a genuine game-changer. Heavy \"my uncle works at valve\" vibes. But the stuff hes talking about at least makes sense to me anyway and seems plausible. So I figured hell why not post it.",

Drop the end of the rope in the tug of war and they lose the momentum, the fight, and the power struggle. The Dems are being drowned out slowly....by defunding, no USAID, crime, murder, rape, burglaries are still going on and just are not getting attention over protests. New work/volunteer requirements start for welfare programs, they won't use ICE for their requirement if there aren't any protests that would count as them volunteering. Their fraud is being found and they do have to pay that back so these Dem cities are facing financial difficulties. Housing for illegals is stopping. They are going to be struggling.....instead of power struggling with Trump (he stops the power struggle by withdraw, either slightly or heavily, no different or drastic)....they will be struggling with themselves and not daddy Trump.

        "score": 41,
        "text_content": "AdHoc's PR team are so vague in communication, they even have a hard time telling a simple truth. During their statement regarding the controversy they stated, \"As Nintendo states, any game that\u2019s going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to \u2018*meet \\[Nintendo\u2019s\\] established content and platform guidelines.*\u2019 This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn\u2019t meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That\u2019s what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we\u2019re the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms.\" The issue here is that they are conflating Nintendo's guidelines with the Japanese rating board. They're fully aware of the censorship that had to be made for the PS5 version in Japan (also known as the global Switch/Switch 2 versions), yet they never talked about it during their statement. Instead, they state that they are the developers that brought this game uncensored to other platforms without specifying the regions because this is clearly untrue for the PS5 in Japan. On their recent statement they go on to state, \"We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same. During the porting process it became clear that was not the case.\" This is a case of giving the people a half truth, it is true that Dispatch couldn't do the same as Witcher 3/Cyberpunk because those games are made by a company that have money to release different SKUs (one SKU for Japan and the other for the west). While AdHoc are a small company with a debut game released and they most likely tried to save costs by releasing one SKU (the Japanese version worldwide for the Switch platforms). This is what AdHoc simply won't say Here is a statement showing unclear intent, \"we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content.\" By this they mean that the western version's censorship will be removed, but not in Japan. That's why they said \"some\" as opposed to stating ALL. Again this shows a high level of vagueness in their response The last bit here really takes people for a fool if you don't know about Nintendo 's process for patches from third party developers \"I'll get ahead of it now and say that between dev time and the console submission process, we're talking weeks not days.\" Doesn't Nintendo make developers wait a couple of weeks before developers can push out patches on the Switch/Switch 2? So all of this goes to show that AdHoc has a huge problem by having such an incompetent PR team. This is something they have to fix going forward. Oh and if you bought Dispatch on Switch/Switch 2 get a refund until the censorship issue is fixed. Refunds are now available, if you live in the Americas here is the link: [https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/contact](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/contact) If you live in the UK, here is a phone number to contact Nintendo in regards to your refund +443456050247",

The risk of \"widening social and economic divides\" is not created by AI but by the refusal of the governments to prepare society for the changes the leaders of the economy constantly openly proclaim as their goals. People think that \"we need more time to prepare for AI\" which is false. We had, and mostly still have, more than enough time for it but it seems like that we need AI to come in like a wrecking ball for society to start taking action in the first place.",

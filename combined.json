We want solutions. We never consented to this shit. Now there's going to have to be immense pain as we send millions of unassimilated immigrants back.

Not only this, it pairs really well with FS that they've made, streaming data where you're focusing on, without wasting bandwidth, whilst helping to reduce latency. Also, looking at their Steam Link menu, it seems you can share 'eye tracking data to other apps on the PC'. I assume Valve already plans to release the API, frankly due to how apps like VR Chat is massive in this space, and will probably use the tech, so not worried on Foveated Rendering not being a thing.

His source is certainly referring to HL3 here. The source's credibility is still up in the air especially since they made no mention of things revealed this week. Despite this, I think I'm inclined to believe this as Valve wouldn't want to overshadow today's announcements with HL3 (smart call) and to collect quick initial feedback on the offerings announced today, but HL3/HLX is very obviously in the polishing stages and close to completion per datamining (if not outright done) and it would be the perfect software to sell people on the new hardware.

Here's a bit from the article: The new game is called Horizon Steel Frontiers, and Sony and the Korean video game company NCSoft are working on it together. Based on a more than 10-minute video we\u2019ve seen featuring a mix of cinematic and pre-alpha gameplay footage as well as developer interviews, the game will focus strongly on fighting the Horizon series\u2019 giant mechanical beasts and being able to do so with other people. Sony and a PR company representing NCSoft didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment. The Verge initially spotted promotional art for Steel Frontiers on a website used to share game assets that media and influencers are approved to use. The art seems to have been posted early, perhaps ahead of an announcement at the G-Star 2025 event in Korea later tonight. According to the website, Steel Frontiers will be available on PC, iOS, and Android.

A massive increase in house prices coincided with the Fed\u2019s QE, translating into higher housing inflation. Housing was a key component of the post-COVID inflationary episode and kept overall inflation above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.

By contrast, formal languages such as Lean^(1) offer an interactive environment that grounds reasoning, and reinforcement learning (RL) provides a mechanism for learning in such environments. We present AlphaProof, an AlphaZero-inspired^(2) agent that learns to find formal proofs through RL by training on millions of auto-formalized problems. Lean is cool because the AI can actually verify if it got the answer correct. Unlike other forms of learning, it can actually do RLVR, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean\\_(proof\\_assistant)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant)) A lot of people are working heavily in this area.

I like the 3 different sizes, I tend to use the trigger grips more often, as the plus grips were too big to be comfortable for me, (they remind me of the ps5 controller size.) at least on the right side. When on the right it made it hard to reach the face buttons. I will use the plus grip on the left for more coverage of the left joystick though. I appreciate being able to have different sizes. They are a hard plastic, but have a texture on them and they feel comfortable to hold. I am a huge fan of the maxcarry case. It holds the switch with whichever grips or grip combination you use on it and provides plenty of room below for the other grips and some accessories. I really like that not only is the storage below the Switch, something I haven\u2019t see much of, but that there is a protective flap that the Switch sits on that covers the storage compartment as well as one that covers the screen. I have a battery pack, its cable, a 12 card game case, and the other grips there and it fits fine. I also like that\u2019s it is very strong feeling. You even have storage for 12 cards on the top flap. There is a slight internal indent to match the Joystock on the top cover as well. I think the mesh pouch on the top of the cover is a waste as it doesn\u2019t hold much of anything. I use it to hold the included microfiber cloth. It is removable though but anything you put into it makes the case seem more tight. I don\u2019t t think you would go wrong with the grip case as its grip system is excellent. Just remember that with the grip case you lose access to the built in stand completely.",

AI is already widely used across Silicon Valley to accelerate many kinds of computer programming. In games development, it can be used to replace voice actors and create backdrops and other assets, as well as automating play testing to avoid bugs before release.\" \"The investors are betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA\u2019s profits in coming years, people involved in the transaction told the Financial Times.\" More on the deal: \"Kushner, the son-in-law of US President Donald Trump, played an instrumental role in getting the deal over the line. He and Egon Durban, co chief of Silver Lake, began studying a possible takeover earlier this year, according to two people briefed on the talks. The people said Kushner was key to getting Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund interested in participating in the takeover at a time when it is retrenching from some private investments. He set up investment firm Affinity Partners after leaving the White House following Trump\u2019s first term, and PIF is a large investor in Kushner\u2019s fund. People close to the discussions said Kushner\u2019s involvement would also ease the deal\u2019s path through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which adjudicates on deals involving foreign buyers.\" Source: https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133",

According to someone familiar with Sony\u2019s plans, the company is working on a new version of the PlayStation 5 Pro. We don\u2019t know all the changes yet, but the updated PS5 Pro is said to use about 3% less power than the current model. The more interesting news is about a new DualSense controller, referred to behind the scenes as the DualSense V3. It\u2019s expected to launch in November, replacing the current models in stores and also being bundled with the new PS5 Pro. Our sources say the DualSense V3 will feature a removable battery. We\u2019ll update when we know more.",

The Report provides the real estate ecosystem, including agents and home buyers and sellers, with data on the level of home sales under contract. Pending sales rose month-over-month in the Midwest, South, and West, and declined in the Northeast. Year-over-year, sales increased in all regions. August\u2019s REALTORS\u00ae Confidence Index survey shows that 19% of NAR members expect an increase in buyer traffic over the next three months, up from 16% last month and unchanged from one year ago. Meanwhile, 19% expect an increase in seller traffic, down from 21% last month and up from 18% in August 2024. \"Lower mortgage rates are enabling more home buyers to go under contract,\" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. \"In the Midwest, low mortgage rates combined with high levels of affordability are attracting more buyers compared to other regions.\"",

You cannot violate that NEED TO KNOW because it's a fucking crime, can be changed with a crime of you violate NEED TO KNOW.\r\nThese type of Emails needs to come from respective agency heads. NOT OPM.\r\nThis is why Fed agencies have given directions to their employees not to respond until further notice.\r\nSome have said do not respond at all.\r\nWhat Musk did with the email is fucking retarded as if he has never held a security clearance.\r\nIf he wants to weed out ghost employees like he clarified on his X.

This means DoD is not allowed to tell OPM on what they are working on daily because OPM doesn't need to know what DoD is working on. \"NEED TO KNOW\" is a big thing in the gov when you get security clearances. You cannot violate that NEED TO KNOW because it's a fucking crime, can be changed with a crime of you violate NEED TO KNOW. These type of Emails needs to come from respective agency heads. NOT OPM. This is why Fed agencies have given directions to their employees not to respond until further notice. Some have said do not respond at all. What Musk did with the email is fucking retarded as if he has never held a security clearance. If he wants to weed out ghost employees like he clarified on his X. Then he needs to find another way to do it because this Email thing is utterly fucking retarded.",

They're getting kicked out on their asses, as they RIGHTLY should have been years ago. \n\nOnce this all blows over, we'll find that the only thing that really happened, was the useless ass people got the boot, and the people who actually do shit were fine. \n\nAgain, ask me how I know. \n\nThere's no way they're firing helo pilots, for example. People who are vital to operations. \n\nThey are, however, firing do nothing karens who have titles like \"operations and logistics support specialist\" because they do literally nothing. \n\nMy cock couldn't be harder, seeing these people FINALLY get what I've wanted to see for YEARS.

I started to notice it back during the first round of Trump election riots and blue haired feminists shoving their fists in the air. \n\nThis photo actually perfectly supports my hypothesis. \n\nIf you go back and look at some of those george floyd riots and \"peaceful protests\" the ones where white college aged women pose for photos of them kneeling with their hands up in the air... There's always something pretty common with them. \n\nEach and every one of these people have constructed carefully crafted costumes that they wear. They have thought up this idea in their heads, of what they believe is a diversity, inclusion, and equity superhero. It's usually someone with a sickle and hammer shirt or other clothing, brightly colored hair, piercings and jewelry adorning their face, skinny jeans, and boots. \n\nI've said before, my hypothesis is basically two fold/interconnected. First, they view this as an in-vogue fashion statement. It's \"hip\" to \"bash the fash\" or whatever the fuck else they call it. Standing on a sidewalk, kneeling down in front of cameras, and raising your fist in the air is a fashion statement as much as it is a political statement. \n\nSecondly, they have taken careful steps to ensure that the photo opportunities mimic what they saw in their classrooms when they were on the civil rights chapters of classroom civics. \n\nSeriously, go back and look at a lot of those photos. They always jump through hoops to make sure they're seen posing with picket signs, or a fist up in the air, or in some \"clash\" with people. \n\nIt starts to make even more sense when you look at more footage of these events to have better context. \n\nThese people only start behaving in this way, once they realize the cameras are on them. Many of them don't even go to these \"protest\" for any reason other THAN to get in front of a camera. \n\nThey've all imagined themselves to be some social justice crusader, whom they believe will become the next middle school textbook photograph, or cover to time magazine. \n\nThey don't give two fucking shits about george floyd. Or racial whatever. \n\nThey're only out there screaming and pissing because it's an opportunity for attention. It's an opportunity to make it about them. \n\nOtherwise, why would they spend so much time and energy crafting the perfect costume for the event? It's very obvious these ones have put extensive amounts of energy into building their outfits up. \n\nAnd secondly, why else would they go to such lengths to get in front of someones camera? \n\nIt's narcissism all the way down. \n\nThis OP photo more or less confirms what I'm saying. It's an iconic historic photo where they're trying to twist it into a modern \"protest\". \n\nThese people don't even know what they're protesting or crying about. \n\nThey know Elon Musk and Orange Man bad, but they don't know why, and they don't care. All that matters is the ideology, above all else. \n\nThe ideology told them Elon is the target, so by god they're going to target him, and they're going to do it in stylish fashion and they're going to do it in such a way that they can get mileage out of it for themselves and their own image. \n\nPure, fucking unadulterated, distilled, 100% home grown narcissism.

benchmarks\n- geometric mean in all cases\n- standard raster performance without ray-tracing and/or DLSS/FSR/XeSS\n- extra ray-tracing benchmarks (mostly without upscaler) after the standard raster benchmarks\n- stock performance on (usually) reference/FE boards, no overclocking\n- factory overclocked cards were normalized to reference clocks/performance, but just for the overall performance average (so the listings show the original performance result, just the performance index has been normalized)\n- missing results were interpolated (for a more accurate average) based on the available & former results\n- performance average is (some) weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks\n- all reviews should have used newer drivers for _all_ cards\n- power draw numbers based on a couple of reviews, always for the graphics card only\n- performance/price ratio (higher is better) for 1440p raster performance and 1440p ray-tracing performance\n- for the full results and some more

Even used 4080 Supers, which launched for $999, are being marked up several hundred dollars.\n\nI bought a used 3080 on there when the 4000 series launched for $500. Unbelievable that a previous gen card from three years ago is actually selling for a higher price than it's launch price, it's refreshed version and it's next-gen counterpart.",

Overall, perf compared to the 4070 Ti Super and 4080 was ballpark to be expected given what we already knew on the real world perf uplift of the 5080 over the 4080 Super on the spec difference.\n\nHad the 7900 GRE been included, would've coincidentally been an opportune moment to compare with the ~~7090/XT~~ 9070/XT AMD slide leak. Tho, with the 7800 XT included, we already know the 7900 GRE is [\\~8% faster](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1balk2m/amd_radeon_rx_7900_gre_meta_review/) in raster. XT will probably trades blows with the 5070 Ti or remain some sort of percentage below (5% for ex, just realized in the videocardz article AMD apparently don't have a 5070 Ti in hand lol, will probably make some joke in their announcement about \"MSRP\") and RT may behave like a 4070 Ti/Super. Anyways, love these meta reviews, and excited for the next!",

There are three visual modes on offer: Fidelity, Balanced, and Performance. And you can set framerate caps independently from your chosen mode to 30, 60, or uncapped. If you want to run Fidelity mode with an uncapped framerate, more power to you. PS5 Pro players will be very happy with this. 40fps caps are also available if you\u2019re connected to a compatible display. I played through most of the game on fidelity mode, but switched to the performance mode in the latter half, and experienced locked 30 and 60 frames respectively.",

There's also some sort of side plot involving South Korea but unsure what exactly it will entail.\n\n>Each POV will be tonally quite different, with TF141's being more akin to the rebooted series with a focus on stealth infiltration and high action hero-esque segments, while Demon Dogs will be more akin to American missions in the original trilogy, with a focus on immersive urban firefights and CQB room clearing segments.\n\n>As far as characters, the Demon Dogs' POV its seemingly just Griggs and new characters. With 141 it's the obvious members (Yes, Soap is infact still dead.)\nPrice being wanted for Shepherd's murder doesn't seem to be too major of a plot point.\n\n>Last story comment is, the game will be attempting to go for MW (2019)'s strategy of containing many shock value moments and a much darker tone, there will be less of an emphasis on 141 being \"heroes\" and more so just above average soldiers that are revered as being the best of the best and willing to do anything to accomplish the mission, with morals taking more of a backseat against what gets results.\n\n>As previously leaked there is some sort of NYC mission, although rather than it being an invasion like the original MW3 it seems it is a terrorist attack by Makarov, being a false flag attack posing as Russia (it also seems this mission is a flashback, taking place shortly after MWIII).\n\n>Quick comment on setting, MWIV is taking a bit of a near-futuristic approach, similar to Black Ops II and Ghosts, the game will attempt to remain grounded, while also taking creative liberties with the technology of a world living in the aftermath of BOII's 2nd Cold War.\nThe game is scheduled to release in 2026 under Infinity Ward as the lead developer. The studio has undergone quite a few changes in leadership since 2022's MWII.",

It was released as promotional material for their products. I can't remember if it was on android, but I do remember playing it on my ipod 4. It was a puzzle game where the player had to use the touch screen to manipulate a flowing field of energy through circles with slits in them to charge up. Once all of them were charged up, the level was completed. Anyone remember the name of it?\n\nEdit: Here is an example of how a level might look. The energy would flow in the direction of the dotted line. The player would use the touch screen to bend the energy through the circles.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vcw7c34roxke1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1f137f95e6ca33328058bb1e414fd2c04e016a0",

If you suggest otherwise, people will say they have to be going or (politely) avoid you at the market from then on.\n\n\nAlmost nobody is paring down, tightening their belts, limiting exposure, mitigating risks or bracing for impact (except big businesses who are basically doing recurring rounds of layoffs, mergers and store closures).\n\n\nI've never seen anything like it.

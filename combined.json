Then they sell those items to a shady corner store somewhere who pays them in cash for the items cheaper than a distributor sells them for. They then take that money and buy drugs. Happens all the time. They can also let the drug dealer buy borrow their card who will give them drugs worth 50 cents on the dollar for the remainder of the cash on that card.

The 5500X3D was rumoured to exist back in 2024 but only released in the past few months as a Latin America exclusive. Only the 5700X3D came to international fruition, and it's a few tiers above this chip, so I wouldn't consider it all that equivalent (against say, the 5500X3D). As for the non-X3D 7500(F) for the majority of its life it was an exclusive release as well and Westerners could only get them via Aliexpress, eBay or any other unofficial third party resellers. That's changed recently, it seems the 7500F is now mostly available globally, but in a fair amount of countries it's still more expensive than the 7600, and it's taken 3 years since the launch of Zen 4 to get here. AMD's kept AM5 at a relatively high price point compared to budget AM4 and I'd reckon it intentional. Why would they suddenly release a budget X3D CPU to bring down the price of AM5 to consumers when Intel's effectively meaningless in the gaming segment already? Aside from that, AMD historically doesn't seem to want to release budget X3D CPUs internationally, and you can't really blame them. It'd take away 7800X3D and 9800X3D customers if they see a budget X3D chip doing 90% of the performance for half the cost. That could be different in places like Latin America though, where there could be a price gap AMD could fill with a budget X3D CPU. As much as it'd be awesome to see a budget X3D chip, I doubt it'll happen on a global scale.",

Analysts are lowering projections for future rent growth. * **Inflation Impact**: Sluggish rent growth is helping keep inflation in check, since housing is a major component of the consumer-price index. * **Pandemic-Era Overbuilding**: Developers rushed to build during the pandemic, leading to the biggest apartment boom in 40 years. But delays and labor shortages extended the supply surge. * **Changing Demographics**: Remote workers are returning to offices, and immigration is slowing, reducing demand in previously booming regions. * **Record Concessions**: In September, 37% of rentals included concessions like free rent\u2014an all-time high for that month, according to Zillow. * **Real-Life Examples**: Renters like Anika Nelson and Spencer McKean are securing leases with generous perks, reflecting the power shift toward tenants.",

That will cause inflation to increase, and we will have to have another Fed tightening cycle. This could go on could a decade or longer and end only when the Fed raises rates to double-digit levels. In that scenario, it\u2019s not very good to be a renter long term, _unless_ you are investing the rental savings. Then it could be great, depending on the price: rent ratio in your area.",

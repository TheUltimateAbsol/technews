        "text_content": "There are currently reports across the internet that Zen 6 (referring to the desktop version \u201cOlympic Ridge\u201d) and Nova Lake (again referring to the desktop version \u201cNVL-S\u201d) have been postponed until 2027, specifically CES 2027. In my opinion, these are misunderstandings and hasty assumptions. The basis for these reports is very weak in each case. In the case of **Zen 6**, the original source ([BenchLife](https://benchlife.info/amd-zen-6-olympic-ridge-might-offer-12-cores-chiplet-as-24-cores-cpu-options/)) does not report a postponement at all. Rather, BenchLife mentions the Zen 6 date \u201c2027\u201d without further comment or explicit emphasis in a report on the core configurations of Zen 6. This is simply a different opinion on the launch date of Zen 6, but not a report of a postponement. A report about an actual postponement of Zen 6 should always be worth an explicit article from the original source. This has not happened; articles about postponements are exclusively interpretations by this source (BenchLife) or simply rewrites of other articles. In the case of **Nova Lake**, it should be noted that CES is Intel's usual launch date for its broad product portfolio. Normally, the non-K models of the desktop portfolio and the complete mobile portfolio would be officially unveiled there. The K models of the desktop portfolio, on the other hand, would normally be launched in late fall of the previous year (i.e., 2026). Under certain circumstances, all statements from \u201cNVL-S at CES 2027\u201d may therefore only refer to the usual procedure \u2013 presentation of the broad portfolio at CES 2027. This does not mean that the K models will also only be launched at CES 2027, so this remains open. Until there is clear confirmation that this also refers to the K models, the matter remains open. However, it is not particularly likely that Intel will be unable to launch the K models in late fall 2026 if the broad portfolio is coming to CES 2027 anyway. This does not mean that postponements are not possible. However, the available evidence is currently too weak to be certain about this.

        "score": 4,
        "text_content": "I thought folks here might be interested in some surprising (to me) benchmark results I got when I tried disabling Intel RST in the BIOS of two PCs today. **The tl;dr is: one got faster with RST turned off, but the other got slower!** One is my desktop, an Alienware Aurora R15 with a Core i9-13900KF. It has an OEM SK Hynix PC801 and a Samsung 980 PRO that I added, both 2TB. The other is my laptop, also an Alienware, x16 R2 with a Core 9 Ultra 185H. It has an OEM WD SN740 and a Samsung 990 EVO Plus that I added, both 1TB. Neither has ever been running in RAID; RST was enabled from the factory, and I was too lazy to change it and fuss with Windows complaining about it. I kind of assumed they'd be faster with RST off, but that the difference would be negligible. In both cases, sequential throughput didn't really change. All the differences there were within what I'd consider measurement error. Random throughput and the associated IOPS, though.... On the desktop, random reads jumped over 50% with RST turned off! |random reads|RST on |RST off| |:-|:-|:-| |PC801 throughput|992 MB/s|1574 MB/s| |PC801 IOPS|242k|384k| |980PRO throughput|1014 MB/s|1650 MB/s| |980PRO IOPS|248k|403k| Meanwhile, on the laptop, it's the random *write* numbers that were most affected, and in the opposite direction: performance was *halved* with RST turned off! |random writes|RST on |RST off| |:-|:-|:-| |SN740 throughput|1851 MB/s|914 MB/s| |SN740 IOPS|428k|223k| |990EVO+ throughput|1897 MB/s|914 MB/s| |990EVO+ IOPS|443k|223k| A little bit of a caveat: for the desktop the \"RST on\" numbers are old. They're from when I first got the PC and first installed the 2nd SSD. That said, I wouldn't expect the SSD itself to get *faster* over time - in fact I just learned the PC801 is suffering from a known bug that's killing its sequential write speed. For the laptop, though, I of course went and turned it on again and retested, so these are same-day numbers. I honestly couldn't guess about the why, except maybe Intel has improved the RST implementation over the processor generations. One thing that does jump out at me is that the slower numbers (RST on for the desktop, RST off for the laptop) are nearly identical (exactly identical on the laptop!) while the faster numbers show a bit more variance, even if they're not hugely different. That sounds like a bottleneck to me. Beyond that, though, I don't have much of a guess.",

Of course, I expected to enjoy the game, but to be honest, I wasn't totally sure I'd *love* it - it just felt like one of those things everyone should play at least once. However, I've actually been extremely pleasantly susprised by *how much* I've enjoyed both the gameplay and getting to know these characters. I wasn't sold on either of the above at first, but I'm in the final stretch now and feel like things have really come into their own. And it's not just the bigger, more dramatic story beats, it's the goofiness and often awkwardness that makes things too. Somewhat relatedly, something I've found kind of fascinating is how uneven this game is for a big AAA experience. And I don't necessarily consider that a minus point. This isn't *as* polished as I was expecting, but that's kind of cool - you get to feel a bit more of what and who's behind it that way and it gives the game a more human feeling. I remember at the time it was considered quite controversial Squenix were splitting this up into three games, but that decision surely must be considered justified now. The fact Remake is simultaneously almost a prologue to a much grander world and narrative while also being so epic in its own right is truly impressive, and I actually really like how for this first game you're entirely constrained within one city as I'm sure it's going to make Rebirth feel like such a different thing. Also, if Rebirth really is, as the consensus seems to be, even better than this, then roll on 3rd June! (Although I've still got INTERmission to get to first.)",

                "raw_content": "Steve very briefly alluded to something that I want to bring up because I think some people have really short memories, and this certain something really bothered me. AMD initially did not want and did not allow Ryzen 5000 series cpus to work on the 300 series chipset AM4 boards. A lot of people praise AMD for the AM4 platform, but I do not think this is really deserved. AMD has to release a bios \"blob\" to the motherboard manufacturers, who use that to make bios updates for their boards. When Ryzen 5000 cpus were released they would not work on the A320, B350, and X570 boards. BIOS updates for those did not exist, and it was AMd's fault. AMD was giving the most loyal customers of theirs, the early Ryzen adopters, a big middle finger. They wanted people to upgrade motherboards instead. Ryzen 5950X review from HUB was on Nov 5, 2020 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsfvRw74h30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsfvRw74h30) BIOS updates for the 300 series chipsets was announced in March of 2022 and started being available in May 2022. [https://www.techpowerup.com/292955/amd-brings-official-ryzen-5000-support-to-300-series-chipset-motherboards-circa-2016](https://www.techpowerup.com/292955/amd-brings-official-ryzen-5000-support-to-300-series-chipset-motherboards-circa-2016) That was a huge gap in time. Was it really a technical issue? I don't think it was. AMD wanted people to upgrade boards, like what Intel does. I think AMD's reversal of their initial decision was not done out of the goodness of their hearts. The people who had 300 series chipset boards who wanted a cpu upgrade had to upgrade their board. If you had to upgrade your board, why not consider all possibilities, as in why not also consider Intel? LGA 1700 cpus were faster for gaming, so why not get one of those? I think AMD realized people were jumping ship to Intel so they finally released the bios update to manufacturers. The point is that they were not trying to do the right thing for their customers. In my opinion they don't deserve so much credit for the long lifespan of the platform as everyone gives them.",

Thats 1 GPU and 1 NVME drive and the motherboard normally takes 4 lanes for its own useless gimmick and your done. Thats it, no more expansion. Diddly Squat. AM6 will focus on expandability again. With PCIe 6 just around the corner as well as DDR6, for AMD to support those, they will need the create new socket. Also rumours of a PCIe x32 slot going to exist.

Based on my understanding, it is only used at the moment for 3 things: Cocreator in Paint, Live Captions, and Webcam effects. Well, the thing is, all three features have been implemented before without the NPU, like, we were blurring our backgrounds on Zoom with our CPUs and GPUs. So why does Microsoft force CPU companies to dedicate a big chunk of their silicon space to this? It makes no sense, say, the Intel integrated GPU can do exactly what their NPU can do! Well, as it turns out, Microsoft's justification is that an NPU is more efficient, and consumes less power. But like, does it really make sense to dedicate chip area to marginally reducing power consumption in literally 1 of 3 things..... Edit: Look at this photograph [https://www.techpowerup.com/img/xASpu58JP7LpKqhb.jpg](https://www.techpowerup.com/img/xASpu58JP7LpKqhb.jpg) Lunar Lake's NPU is bigger than the E core cluster and almost as big as the P cores! The NPU does 48 TOPS, while the GPU does 67 TOPS. Why use the NPU when you can just use the GPU? You're giving up that much chip area for a little bit of power savings on 3 things?",

So people had thought that sodium battery chemistry might be constrained to grid scale batteries and stationary systems. But these power density figures are comparable to mid level lithium ion.

Many programmers work in a larger context, with product managers, user interface designers, data scientists, program managers, salespeople, digital artists, etc. And, ultimately, there are customers, the people who will use whatever the programmers create. Here's a question that interests me: within that larger context, one group of people-- programmers-- are suddenly accelerating by like 10x. So what are the consequences for the larger ecosystem? We're going to find out in 2026, and I think it will be... stressful. For example, when coding something took a year, folks working on artwork, the user interface, product specifications, etc. could reasonably take a few months. But now programmers can deliver in a week. So product development time pressure will intensify on people in those other roles: \"PLEASE just pick a UI by the end of \\*today\\*, so AI can code the application over the weekend, and we can ship the product on Monday...\" What was previously delivered in months will now be demanded in days or hours. As a special case, how customers deal with acceleration is an open question. Complex applications have a learning curve, so there is a limit to how fast people can absorb new software. Some software packages roll out UI changes over years, because coding takes time and customers have to adapt. But what if that messy UI in Blender (or whatever) could, in principle, be rewritten as fast as it could be designed? Now customers learning to use the new UI is the bottleneck.",

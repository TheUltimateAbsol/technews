Yep. Agreed. Been saying this for a long time. A lot of people, especially gamers here, wish/think AI is a fad. It's clearly not and clearly just the very beginning of something that will go on for decades. My 1 year old post spells out my thoughts on AI chip industry: https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1da3mqg/amd_is_right_about_ai_pcs_being_the_biggest/l7hzy4l/ Snippets: >In some ways, we're really like the 1960s in terms of computers. Back then, you needed computers the size of a small room to run basic software that we can run on a calculator today. Today, running something like GPT4 probably takes a small room full of GPUs in a datacenter somewhere. Over time, small computers could run demanding software and the personal computer was born. It'll likely happen in AI as well. Initially, small computers are hopeless. But the software (AI models in this case) mature and stop growing exponentially while the hardware gets exponentially better. >It's been a long time since we have mass-market software that modern chips are too slow to run. CPUs, RAM bandwidth/size, and even GPUs have long been in a \"good enough\" state. GenAI is the first mass market application I've seen that renders a modern computer hopeless. So for me, I'm getting excited about chips again and I think we will see some major leaps in AI accelerators in each generation. The race just got started.",

        "score": 29,
        "text_content": "**TL;DR:** The Flip7 display is more efficient due to the removal of the circular polarizer which increases light transmittance, reducing the power required to maintain the same brightness. With the announcement of the Flip7 last week, Samsung [subtly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cMS8qECR0A&t=2289) hinted at the use of a display with colour filter on encapsulation (CoE) technology. The keynote mentioned a thinner and vibrant panel with an embedded polarizer, which appeared to describe CoE perfectly. I had the opportunity to speak with VP Minseok Kang, Head of Smartphone Product Planning at Samsung Mobile eXperience, who confirmed the application of CoE on the Flip7 display. A conventional OLED display includes a circular polarizer which reduces ambient light reflection, resulting in better contrast and image quality. The polarizer also reduces light transmittance by about 50%, which decreases the brightness of the display. As a result, more light and power is required to produce the same brightness, compared to a display without a circular polarizer. An OLED display with CoE replaces the circular polarizer by integrating an RGB colour filter, black matrix, and black pixel define layer into the panel. This increases light transmittance while minimizing ambient light reflection. As a result, less light and power is required to produce the same brightness, compared to a display with a circular polarizer, resulting in a more efficient display. Furthermore, less heat is generated, and the overall lifetime of the panel is extended. Alternatively, the increased light transmittance can allow for a brighter display with the same power consumption as a display with a circular polarizer. Samsung first commercialized the technology under the name [Eco^2 OLED](https://global.samsungdisplay.com/28402) on the Fold3, and it has been featured on every Fold series device ever since. According to their data, the first generation Eco^2 OLED reduces power consumption by up to 25%, while the second generation [Eco^2 OLED Plus](https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31345) reduces power consumption by up to 37%, compared to a conventional OLED display. The Flip7 is the first Flip series device from Samsung to adopt a CoE display. Given that the Flip6 and Flip7 main displays share the same peak brightness of 2600 nits, the Flip7 display should be much more efficient. Foldables from other OEMs also feature CoE displays. Xiaomi has used it since the [Xiaomi MIX Fold2](https://www.mi.com/global/discover/article?id=2756). Oppo has used it since the [Find N2](https://omdia.tech.informa.com/blogs/2023/feb/oppo-launches-two-new-foldable-smartphones-with-displays-from-samsung-display-and-boe), and [Find N3 Flip](https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphones/series-find-n/find-n3-flip/). Motorola has used it since at least the [moto razr 60 series](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tcl-csot-display-technology-sets-new-trend-in-foldables-with-lenovo-moto-razr-60-series-302502313.html) ([Ross Young](https://xcancel.com/DSCCRoss/status/1663904514229911553) mentioned it was expected on the razr 40 ultra, but I couldn't find any mention of it). According to [Chosun Biz](https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2025/03/03/EFIIRPVGSRGORAAIIPPUU5PVLM/), the Vivo X Fold2, and Google Pixel Fold also have CoE displays. CoE displays aren't limited to foldables either. The [Realme GT7 Pro](https://www.realme.com/global/realme-gt-7-pro) released last year was actually the first bar type phone to feature a CoE display. We should start to see more bar type phones with CoE displays next year. The Galaxy S26 Ultra is [rumoured](https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=32201) to include it which should contribute to widespread adoption.

Still, I'd like to see a test of ambient light rejection. Somewhat different display technology, but polarizer free QD-OLED TV's have problems with lifted blacks, and phones are bound to see much more ambient light than TV's - that said, if it was an obvious issue, I'd imagine someone would have noticed it by now.",

In recent years, the company spent billions acquiring brands such as Tricon Residential, American Campus Communities and AIR Communities. Blackstone\u2019s rental housing portfolio contains apartment complexes, student housing, mobile home parks, and single-family rental properties. Many of their U.S. assets are concentrated in major cities such as New York and in Sun Belt states including Texas, Georgia and Florida. \u201cThere tends to be a high degree of consistency across our different pools of capital,\u201d Kathleen McCarthy, global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cReally what we try to follow across the globe is job and population growth.\u201d Blackstone says it owns less than 1% of the 46 million rental homes scattered across the country. The Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust currently has an ownership interest in at least 274,859 rental housing units. But this is a narrow slice of their overall portfolio. \u201cOf their $315 billion in real estate, only roughly $55 billion is in the BREIT product, which is sold to retail investors,\u201d said Craig McCann, principal at SLCG Economic Consulting. Blackstone Real Estate launched in 1991 with funds raised from accredited and institutional investors. Its parent company, The Blackstone Group, began as a private equity firm that used techniques such as leveraged buyouts to acquire and improve distressed assets. \u201cThey recognized early on the value of diversification,\u201d said Greggory Warren, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. Blackstone could benefit from their recent acquisitions in the years to come. \u201cBuying is still cheaper than building in many markets, as is typical at the start of a new cycle. This is limiting construction and supporting rent growth,\u201d Will Pattison, head of real estate research at MetLife Investment Management, said in a statement to CNBC.",

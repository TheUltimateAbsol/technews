Yep. Agreed. Been saying this for a long time. A lot of people, especially gamers here, wish/think AI is a fad. It's clearly not and clearly just the very beginning of something that will go on for decades. My 1 year old post spells out my thoughts on AI chip industry: https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1da3mqg/amd_is_right_about_ai_pcs_being_the_biggest/l7hzy4l/ Snippets: >In some ways, we're really like the 1960s in terms of computers. Back then, you needed computers the size of a small room to run basic software that we can run on a calculator today. Today, running something like GPT4 probably takes a small room full of GPUs in a datacenter somewhere. Over time, small computers could run demanding software and the personal computer was born. It'll likely happen in AI as well. Initially, small computers are hopeless. But the software (AI models in this case) mature and stop growing exponentially while the hardware gets exponentially better. >It's been a long time since we have mass-market software that modern chips are too slow to run. CPUs, RAM bandwidth/size, and even GPUs have long been in a \"good enough\" state. GenAI is the first mass market application I've seen that renders a modern computer hopeless. So for me, I'm getting excited about chips again and I think we will see some major leaps in AI accelerators in each generation. The race just got started.",

Now if you are willing to spend for a Ubiquiti dream machine router, with newer switch and AP (some are all integrated now), it has a fairly robust SQM solution built in. You can configure it to do traffic shapping and priority per vlan using profiles, and it applies that to the switch as well, with 7 levels of priority using DSCP markings. On the AP you can enable WMM (UAPSD), and that will give some traffic default DSCP markings as it leaves the AP. The router will respect those markings as it does SQM, and you can remark traffic on the router as it leaves to the WAN as well. It does take some setup and know how, but the result it really good and I never see my pings out to the ISP go high even during large downloads. On the UDM model, it now has some QoS priority built in for specific applications and categories, making the setup a little easier if you just want to check a box for that application and set bandwidth limits.

As an additional point of discussion, similar metrics used to evaluate video encoding (e.g. VMAF) have at times gotten under fire for being easily game-able, causing developers to optimize for benchmark scores over subjective visual quality.

The annual nationwide price increase slowed to 1.3% in June, the slowest pace in two years and down from 1.6% the previous month, ICE\u2019s indexes show. Out of the biggest 100 markets, 51 are now below-peak and almost one-third have fallen at least a percentage point from recent highs. Home Price Inflection Point Annual home price growth slowed to 1.3% in June, from 1.6% in May The weakness was most pronounced in the condo market, where prices fell 1.4% year-on-year compared with a 1.6% rise for single-family homes. Overall, national prices rose just 0.03% from the previous month after seasonal adjustment, \u201csuggesting a propensity for further slowing,\u201d ICE said. It described the market as \u201cat a critical inflection point.\u201d Persistently high mortgage rates, which make monthly payments unaffordable for many Americans, continue to drag on housing demand. Even after a recent drop, the typical rate for a 30-year loan remains not far short of 7%. That\u2019s been countered by a boost in homes available for sale in some areas \u2014 particularly the South and West \u2014 but in many markets supply remains tight. Homeowners in parts of the US have already seen an erosion of wealth. Median prices have fallen more than $100,000 from their peak in the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos metro area in Texas, as well as in San Francisco, according to ICE. Florida is home to nine of the 10 major markets that posted the biggest monthly drops in June. In two of them, North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota and Cape Coral-Fort Myers, prices peaked in June 2022 and are down by more than $50,000 since then.",

At first, I started arguing with the OP- I had never made money online before and it sounded sketchy But the guy turned out to be super down-to-earth and explained everything in detail After that, I decided to give it a shot. I only tried $20 at first and couldn\u2019t believe it actually worked! That same evening, I got $100 sent to my personal wallet in just a few hours. Now I\u2019ve been using this method for 5 days already and made around $1500 total- it\u2019s bringing me over $150 per day consistently. So yeah, I don\u2019t regret trying it at all, and I figured it might help someone else too. Thanks for reading- and sorry if I wasted your time! Wishing you all big numbers!",

        "score": 46,
        "text_content": "For a few years now, we've been seeing the slowdown of Moore\u2019s law, as transistors starting to reach the limits of what\u2019s physically possible. The newest TCMS node is just 2NM, the next one is just 1,6NM and the one after that is just 1,4NM. And while there are other improvements in the manufacturing process like 3D stacking, different masks for lithography steps. There\u2019s an end to this tech tree, and I think we\u2019re getting really close to it. Barring the switch to quantum or light based computers I think most improvements to the computer world are going to come from optimisations. I remember more that 10 years ago in CS class a teacher said something along the lines: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to bother optimising the code after you\u2019ve done the basics, because a customer can just buy a faster computer.\u201d With Moore's law slowing down I think we\u2019ll look more and more into optimizing every part of the stack, starting with chip architecture, drivers, OS, and of course finishing with software that we run on it. We can already see it happening, on the architecture level, ARM and RISC-V bringing crazy improvements in performance, and power efficiency. We can see it on the OS side as well. Apple's IOS and Linux are much more efficient at using resources than Windows is. And it\u2019s not just because they can take advantage of ARM based processors, IOS always had better battery life and was shipped with less RAM than equivalent windows machines. While we're on the subject of RAM, I think the current/coming RAM shortage will also play into the optimisation push. Even though RAM is using \u201conly\u201d a 12NM process node for the first time we\u2019re not going to see an increase in the amount of RAM an average consumer has. Now of course it all depends on how long the AI bubble will last, the RAM manufacturers don\u2019t think it will be a long time as they don\u2019t see it being worth it to build up extra capacity. But the point still stands, there will be an end to that tech tree. You can say a similar thing about GPU\u2019s. Most improvements in performance in Nvidia's cards came from brute forcing, they\u2019ve been pushing more and more power to their cards to the point that once a week, if not more often, you can see somebody with a melted cable. So my question is: When do you see the gains in manufacturing reducing to the point where optimization in architecture is going to start making a bigger difference? Or do I have it all wrong? My own thoughts are that in the next five years we\u2019re going to get okay hardware improvements, but once we hit 2030s, optimization is going to be the biggest game in town, in terms of increasing performance. And by optimization I mean in all levels in the stack from architecture to operating systems to the programs running on them. What are your predictions for the next 5-10 years?",

It's true we're approaching the end of the current tech tree, as transistors are already near atom-size level. That said, you can't seriously compare windows and iOS. They don't do the same things and don't have the same objectives. Nvidia isn't brute forcing at all, quite the opposite. Since 2018 they've promoted using fixed function hardware for stuff like Ray tracing, and AI usage of DLSS to not require as much brute force in rendering. That CS teacher is an idiot, you definitely should optimize code. Windows using react native for the start menu is one example of why unoptimized code make it feel slow.",

I\u2019ve gotten through about 7 layers. Love the personality it has. Just a fun, light hearted Nintendo title. Opened Metroid 4 on Christmas and have played about 25 minutes. Basically where I Enter that first green planet. Not disappointed at all yet. I know I\u2019m getting incredible audio and visuals. Cool sci story, and hopefully a beatable game that I can knock off the list. Caught the Cyberpunk 2077 deal. I haven\u2019t had a system in years. But follow gaming and of course remember all the delays when this came out. It\u2019s my style of game with the futuristic world, and after about 45 minutes I\u2019m pretty damn satisfied. Just playing it on easy and enjoying the story. What a cool game. On Christmas I impulsively bought Smash Bros Ultimate and it has become my son\u2019s favorite game. It really is cool, and maybe the most quintessential Nintendo game I\u2019ve played. I just love how you get all the different stages and music from different video games. An incredible list of characters. Also my son and I are very into Pok\u00e9mon right now so having a ball with that aspect. What other games are must buys?

I can see Donkey Kong 64 finally being added to the NSO, it\u2019s long overdue and DK Bananza got quite the exposure with the Game Awards in December. February: I believe we\u2019ll get some sort of return to Kanto for Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s 30th Anniversary, and their easiest way to do it is to release the original Gameboy games. However they\u2019ll make you pay for them on the eShop to enable a Pokemon Home compatibility and prevent glitches and bugs to go through their checks. Colosseum as a shadow drop is likely and we know it\u2019s coming already anyway. Regardless, there will be Pokemon big announcements on Pokemon Day because the 30th Anniversary is a major milestone for them and they\u2019ll want to release games over the year to celebrate it. March: We know already the Pokopia release date and we know Mario Wonder will get its Switch 2 Edition treatment. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll make us wait much longer for it and will likely preview one last trailer in a February Direct to launch it soon after. April: It seems like a good month to capitalise on the appearance of Yoshi in the Galaxy movie, and with the sun slowly coming back, Mario Sunshine feels like the ideal pick to benefit from the new Mario movie and allow core fans that never bought the All Stars collection to replay that game. We know Sunshine is coming and it\u2019s the ideal launch date for me. With the Mario Bros Anniversary, I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t have any issue with the overexposure of the Mario Universe this year. May: By then, Fire Emblem will be ready and it will be a strong core gamer title that should bring back the core Nintendo fans tired of Mario and Pokemon. Tomodachi Life will keep Switch 1 owners busy and will attract a different type of gamers, so two 1st party games on the same month will not be a crazy idea. June: There\u2019s not a better summer game than Rhythm Heaven and it\u2019ll fit perfectly here alongside Pokemon Champions and a new NSO release for Switch 2 owners. Fire Emblem will benefit from those who loved Fortune\u2019s Weave in May and won\u2019t cannibalise its sales by releasing one month later for the big fans of the series. July: Splatoon games usually release during the summer and with what I have predicted next, that would be its perfect spot in the calendar. I can\u2019t really see it releasing anywhere else. August: Probably the wildest take in here but I can see Smash Ultimate getting the Switch 2 treatment with performance upgrades and an additional rogue lite mode. It won\u2019t cost more than $10 and won\u2019t include the Mii costumes and character DLC packs. Maybe it will even be included with the NSO subscription like Zelda? Since the next Smash game is unlikely to come anytime soon, that\u2019d be a way to bring players back to the game. Kirby Planet Robobot has been rumored for so long and if it does release, that\u2019d be in August and I can see it being a Switch 1 game with a free patch to unlock better performance on Switch 2. Nintendo said they won\u2019t abandon Switch 1 and it would be a way to keep Switch 1 players engaged with the system. September: I think Nintendo will want to start creating excitement for the Zelda series and the upcoming movie, and the easiest way will be to bring back on Switch 2 a 2D game as a remake as a way to remind their larger audience about Zelda. That\u2019ll be a way to set up their Zelda strategy going into 2027. Additionally, Zelda 2D games are a perfect fit for the September slot (AA games from beloved franchises). Alongside Zelda, Pokemon will continue its exposure for the 30th Anniversary with XD, the sequel to Colosseum on the NSO. We know it\u2019s coming too, but I doubt they will launch it at the same time as Colosseum, so a few months later seems a good idea. October: The grand finale of the Mario Anniversary and the biggest game of the year with the new 3D Mario. It\u2019s been long overdue and there is simply no way it will release later than that. It\u2019s the Anniversary, they have the movie coming out in 2026, and it\u2019s been so long since Odyssey that 2026 will be the year for Mario. Any Mario 3D after 2026 would be a really odd decision. November: No surprise here, but that will be the grand finale for Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s Anniversary as well. All Pokemon mainline games release in November so this one is probably the least shocking pick from this list (out of the games we officially never heard about). They don\u2019t need to release anything else, Pokemon will sell a lot just like Mario, and both will be the big holiday games. GTA 6 will not be a competition, they attract different kinds of gamers and The Pok\u00e9mon Company wont care anyway since Pokemon will obliterate GTA in Japan. December: This will be a quiet month. Nintendo rarely releases their games in December as it\u2019s not the best release period due to Xmas and holidays (customers usually buy their Xmas presents in October and November, hence the big releases on these months each time). They could release once and for all Smash 64 as a goodbye to 2026, and Twilight Princess will be enough to build momentum for the upcoming Zelda movie and generate new NSO subscriptions after new buyers got their Switch 2 at Xmas. It\u2019s such an iconic game that it can keep people engaged with the Switch 2 on its own. Beyond all of these, I could see a new Animal Crossing game being teased with a \u00ab 2027 \u00bb but in my opinion there\u2019s no way they will release it in a year with a new 3D Mario and Pokemon. 2027 is likely, but 2026 seems too much and unrealistic. I don\u2019t believe in a Mario Kart DLC for now and I can see them releasing one later (maybe 2027 too?) while releasing QOL updates throughout the year.",

        "score": 291,
        "text_content": "Everyone talks about the \"coming\" crash, but if you look at the actual transaction logs from the last 6 months, the crash isn't coming\u2014it's already here, and it's being hidden by \"Extend and Pretend\" accounting. I\u2019ve been digging into the specific numbers on the Blackstone 1740 Broadway default in NYC, and the math is terrifying for anyone holding pension funds or insurance policies. **The Crime Scene**: \\* 2014: Blackstone buys the tower for $605M. \\* The Financing: They wrapped it into a CMBS (Commercial Mortgage-Backed Security). The AAA-rated tranche (the \"safe\" part) was sold to pension funds and insurers. \\* The Crash: LBrands leaves. Blackstone defaults. The building was just sold/valued around $186M. \\* The Result: A \\~69% wipeout on a Manhattan trophy asset. Here is the scary part (The \"AAA\" Lie): In 2008, subprime was the issue. Today, it\u2019s supposed to be \"contained.\" But in this specific deal, the losses were so deep they burned through the lower bonds and actually hit the AAA holders with a \\~26% principal loss. This hasn't happened to a AAA conduit CMBS since the GFC. It's not just NYC. Look at the data points from Q2/Q3: \\* St. Louis (909 Chestnut): Sold for $205M (2006) -> Sold for $3.6M (2024). That is a 98.2% drop. The land is worth more than the building. \\* Los Angeles (Aon Center): $268M -> $147M (\\~45% drop). \\* The \"Hope Note\" Strategy: Banks are splitting loans into \"A-notes\" (performing) and \"B-notes\" (dead/ignored) just to avoid marking the loss on their books. The Fed/FDIC guidance from June 2023 basically gave banks permission to \"work it out\" (aka hide the losses) rather than foreclose. But with $900B+ in loans maturing, the math doesn't work at 7-9% refinancing rates. My Take: The only reason we aren't seeing bank failures daily right now is because they are legally allowed to pretend these buildings are still worth 2019 prices. Has anyone else been tracking the \"B-Note\" restructuring data? It feels like 2008 all over again, but this time the collateral is empty offices instead of strippers with 5 mortgages.",

When it does, it will be very powerful and world changing. * The AI race is totally a geopolitical thing. The US vs China. Both see AI as strategically important, perhaps more important than money, atomic bombs, military power, diplomatic power. AI unlocks every other technology, unlocks economic prosperity, unlock military and diplomatic power. * AI isn't a destination. It is extremely unlikely that we will reach a point where AI is just complete and \"finished\" and no further development. There will just be increasing more and more capable AI. * AI will be applied to all different parts of the economy at different rates. It could take decade or a century for it to be applied to some parts. If the US loses, I am not sure stocks anywhere will be that important. It is entire possible, both sides win, or both side lose.",

        "text_content": "The discourse is always ASI utopia vs overhyped autocomplete. But there's a third scenario I keep thinking about. AI that's powerful enough to automate like 20-30% of white-collar work - juniors, creatives, analysts, clerical roles - but not powerful enough to actually solve the hard problems. Aging, energy, real scientific breakthroughs won't be solved. Surveillance, ad targeting, engagement optimization become scary \"perfect\". Productivity gains that all flow upward. No shorter workweeks, no UBI, no post-work transition. Just a slow grind toward more inequality while everyone adapts because the pain is spread out enough that there's never a real crisis point. Companies profit, governments get better control tools, nobody riots because it's all happening gradually. I know the obvious response is \"but models keep improving\" - and yeah, Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 etc is impressive, the curve is still going up. But getting better at text and code isn't the same as actually doing novel science. People keep saying even current systems could compound productivity gains for years, but I'm not really seeing that play out anywhere yet either. Some stuff I've been thinking about: * Does a \"mediocre plateau\" even make sense technically? Or does AI either keep scaling or the paradigm breaks? * How much of the \"AI will solve everything\" take is genuine capability optimism vs cope from people who sense this middle scenario coming? * What do we do if that happens",

        "score": 37,
        "text_content": "Let's say OpenAI / Gemini / Grok / Claude train some super expensive inference models that are only meant for distillation into smaller, cheaper models because they're too expensive and too dangerous to provide public access. Let's say also, for competitive reasons, they don't want to tip their hand that they have achieved super(ish) intelligence. What markers do you think we'd see in society that this has occurred? Some thoughts (all mine unless noted otherwise): **1. Rumor mill would be awash with gossip about this, for sure.** There are persistent rumors that all of the frontier labs have internal models like the above that are 20% to 50% beyond in capability to current models. Nobody is saying 'super intelligence' though, yet. However, I believe if 50% more capable models exist, they would be able to do early recursive self improvement already. If the models are only 20% more capable, probably not at RSI yet. **2. Policy and national-security behavior shifts (models came up with this one, no brainer really)** One good demo and government will start panicking. Probably classified briefings will start to spike around this topic, though we might not hear about them. **3. More discussion of RSI and more rapid iteration of model releases** This will certainly start to speed up. With RSI will come more rapidly improving models and faster release cycles. Not just the ability to invent them, but the ability to deploy them. **4. The \"Unreasonable Effectiveness\" of Small Models** >**The Marker:** A sudden, unexplained jump in the reasoning capabilities of \"efficient\" models that defies scaling laws. >**What to watch for:** If a lab releases a \"Turbo\" or \"Mini\" model that beats previous heavyweights on benchmarks (like Math or Coding) without a corresponding increase in parameter count or inference cost. If the industry consensus is \"you need 1T parameters to do X,\" and a lab suddenly does X with 8B parameters, they are likely distilling from a superior, non-public intelligence. Gemini came up with #4 here. I only put it here because of how effective gemini-3-flash is. **5. The \"Dark Compute\" Gap (sudden, unexplained jump in capex expenditures in data centers and power contracts, much greater strains in supply chains)** (both gemini and openai came up with this one) **6. Increased 'Special Access Programs'** Here is a good example, imho. AlphaEvolve in private preview: [https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/alphaevolve-on-google-cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/alphaevolve-on-google-cloud) This isn't 'super intelligence' but it is pretty smart. It's more of an early example of SAPs I think we will see. **7. Breakthroughs in material science with frontier lab friendly orgs** This I believe would probably be the best marker. MIT in particular I think would have access to these models. Keep an eye on what they are doing and announcing. I think they'll be the among the first. Another would be Google / MSFT Quantum Computing breakthroughs. If you've probed like I have, you'd see how the models are very very deep into QC. Drug Discovery as well, though I'm not familiar with the players here. ChatGPT came up with this. Fusion breakthroughs is potentially another source, but because of the nation state competition around this, maybe not a great one. **Some more ideas, courtesy of the models:** \\- Corporate posture change (rhetoric shifts and tone changes in safety researchers, starting to sound more panicky, sudden hiring spikes of safety / red teaming, greater compartmentalization, stricter NDAs, more secretive) \\- More intense efforts at regulatory capture .. Some that I don't think could be used: **1. Progress in the Genesis Project.** [**https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/launching-the-genesis-mission/**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/launching-the-genesis-mission/) I am skeptical about this. DOE is a very secretive department and I can see how they'd keep this very close.",

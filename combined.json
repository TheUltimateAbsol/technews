The outlet, which has a relatively strong track record, describes 2027 as the earliest window for \u201cOlympic Ridge\u201d on desktop. >*Olympic Ridge, based on the Zen 6 processor architecture, is expected to continue using the AM5 socket. Taken literally, that would mean current AMD 800-series chipset motherboards could remain compatible. Whether that will actually be the case will likely depend on later confirmation. Olympic Ridge is not expected to arrive before 2027 at the earliest, and AMD\u2019s AM5 socket has been in use since the Zen 4 generation launched in 2023.* >This does not automatically mean Zen 6 as an architecture is \u201clocked\u201d to a 2026 launch for every segment.

The goal of the third phase (2025 - 2040) is to make the domestic supply chain fully independent, including building all fab tools and core technology domestically. Somewhere along the line, the Chinese government stretched the Made in China 2025 project to 2030 and then to 2040 when it comes to developing the semiconductor supply chain. Despite the author calling it stretching the goals, having it be due for 2040 actually makes sense and considering China's rate of progress, seems reasonably feasible. Ultimately, what it uses to justify the \"decade behind\" conclusion is EUV lithography, which is a pretty well known issue: > Modern DUV lithography scanners are at the intersection of ultimate mechanical precision, advanced optics, fluid dynamics, and real-time computational control, where even nanometer-scale deviations can render patterns unusable. Mastering this level of system integration requires decades of accumulated expertise across optics, motion control, software, and process tuning, areas where only a handful of suppliers have achieved production maturity. > As a result, despite visible progress in other segments of wafer fabrication equipment, China remains years behind the most advanced DUV capabilities and at least a decade behind when it comes to EUV tools. So, a nothingburger of an article as far as \"news\" are concerned, but it does provide a nice summary of Chinese policy for the last decade. The Chinese certainly know of the lithography issue and we're not aware of what projects they may have underway to circumvent that nor how successful these may be, but they're certainly trying something because this is a significant part of their state policy.",

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/s/RZ9bNPWnvM](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/s/RZ9bNPWnvM) \u201cThere is also a hidden cutscene of Atreus, in his travels to other pantheons, walking with an individual called \"Mau\". This being communicates only by saying the word \"Mau\", similar to how Groot speaks by saying only \"I'm Groot\", and people can understand what he's saying. Atreus apparently can understand this person through his godly gift of language. Mau is Egyptian for cat, and is also one of the manifestations of the Sun God Ra. Basically, just like the beginning of Ragnarok was hidden in the 2018 files, these dialogues might be the beginning of the next game. The dialogues go like this: Atreus: \"Wake up. I think we're close.\" Mau: \"Mau?\" Atreus: \"Hey, you insisted on coming along. C'mon, let's have a look.\" Mau: \"Mau.\" Atreus: \"I hope you're right. Sounds like we found it.\" And: Robed Figure: \"To lefk\u00f3 f\u00eddi tha se f\u00e1ei.\" Robed Figure: \"One failed us. One rejected us.\" Athena: \"We have a problem.\" I believe \"One failed us\" refers to Odin, and \"One rejected us\" refers to Atreus. Athena is part of a group of beings in the higher plane, which are the voices coming from the rift. Odin failed them and the mission they gave him to use the mask, and Atreus rejected them when he broke the mask.\u201d",

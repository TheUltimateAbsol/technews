        "text_content": "Surprised this wasn't shared yet. There has been decent developments for SD XE on Linux. While there are some quirks in setting it up like keeping WoA installation for extracting the necessary firmware, it's been heading in a good direction since IMO. There are some notable improvements since May, most seen in nT workloads. There are also improvements in firmware in demanding nT workloads. Also it is much more stable, with no random resets or shutdowns. When compared to Intel and AMD, it still isn't up to par with latest gen. You'll find cases where it can trade blows (like in code comp), but mostly you'll find it around Zen 4 mobile and Meteor Lake (before around Tiger Lake). Do take a look of the workloads, some may be interesting in your use cases. iGPU is underwhelming. Drivers still can use some improvement but not really surprised considering it's pretty much a [scaled up Adreno 730](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/the-snapdragon-x-elites-adreno-igpu) (SD Gen 1+ from 2021). Current Adreno on SD 8E is far more performant and interesting. I think SD XE is still very interesting despite what some might think. Growing pains, but it's all investments towards the future. Unfortunate there are no real updates in this sphere, as you'll mostly find data that is based off launch. Also, don't know what's up with power figures not being extrapolated because of sensors not being exposed. Unsure if this has already been 'fixed' on WoA, but you'd think this data point would be at the forefront because of... well ARM.",

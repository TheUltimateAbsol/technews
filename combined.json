Once you realize that, everything makes sense. It's all about reducing individual power in order to reduce collective power. That's why Bill Clinton destroyed manufacturing in America. If things aren't made in America, worker strikes don't really affect anything, and the populace is kept poor, which means less individual power, which means less collective power. They flood in immigrants for the same reason. The more groups there are with different cultures and different values, the smaller the collective power of those groups, and the less those in power are beholden to all groups, in the long run. Democrats don't have to keep any promises to immigrants, because they didn't actually make any promises to them, all the promises that were broken were made to existing Americans, and so the immigrants have no actual skin in the game when it comes to the fulfillment of those promises. Sure, the Democrats give them a bunch of \"free\" shit, but they can also cut it off at any time, and that's the carrot on the stick. And they routinely do cut it. When Biden made inflation go through the roof, that by proportion reduces the value of entitlements. Number value may be the same, but what that number buys sure isn't. And these immigrants also don't understand what it is to be American, which the Democrats/uniparty/globalists love. They may hear about things like rights, but they don't truly understand them or the underlying foundations of them, which is why it's much easier to take that away from them if need be (especially when they technically never constitutionally had it in the first place). What it ultimately means is evil people in power get people they can control with fear, which is then used as a bludgeon to instill fear in others, and the country becomes soo diluted with outsiders that half the country has no real concept of the principles America was built on, and that's the whole point. Once you see it, it's soo obvious that the assessment can't be anything else, even if they do display incompetence. Just like fake news all gets their scripts, so do the politicians. The end game is a totalitarian dystopia that they want people to believe is a utopia.",

So this 'regression' wouldn't be noticeable for lighter games >60FPS saving power at 10W. He didn't compare game benchmarks with the HX370 (Z2E), though you can probably cross reference his benchmarks with his [previous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rai8Cxl1PiI). That video is 5 months old and unsure if AMD has made any more driver improvements, that said, Intel has pretty much caught up. Anyways, this update improves the perf/watt and do keep in mind the 3-4W in savings from the RAM in total system power compared to Ryzen mobile.

But no talent is attached yet, which is very different from the Universal pitch for the project. Per three sources, Steven Spielberg really wanted to direct the *CoD* movie, and his Amblin teamed with Universal dealmaker Jimmy Horowitz to present the filmmaker\u2019s vision for one of the world\u2019s biggest gaming franchises. (**Spielberg is famously a big gamer and loves** ***CoD*** **in particular.**) But with Spielberg comes the famous Spielberg Deal, which includes top-of-market economics, final cut, and full control over production and marketing. That spooked the team from Activision, now owned by Microsoft, which instead went with David Ellison\u2019s pitch that offered much more control over the process.

This seems to confirm that Steam Frame is the official product name of Valve's standalone VR headset codenamed Deckard, which has been in development since 2021 and has been long-awaited by VR enthusiasts. According to previous leaks and datamines, the device runs on an ARM version of SteamOS Linux with compatibility layers for playing Windows and Android-based VR games. It'll also play non-VR Steam games in a previously datamined theater mode. Another SteamVR dataminer, [SadlyItsBradley, has clarified](https://xcancel.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1963491451049771216) that SteamVR's \"overlays\" feature is also being renamed to \"frames\" to coincide with the Steam Frame. Because of these SteamVR changes and the trademark filing coinciding, it seems that a reveal of this headset could be imminent. The Steam Deck had trademarks filed on July 14, 2021, and the official reveal happened the next day, so it's possible we can expect a similar reveal at 10 am PT today. (Just an FYI: If you've seen this post already, that's because I had to repost it. It got auto-removed because I accidentally included a Twitter link instead of Xcancel.)",

That\u2019s down 6% from a year earlier, the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 2023. This is based on a Redfin analysis of county-level home purchase records across 39 of the most populous U.S. metropolitan areas going back through 2000. We define an investor as any institution or business that purchases residential real estate, meaning this report covers both institutional and mom-and-pop investors. Please see the end of this report for a more detailed methodology. Real estate investors are pulling back for similar reasons individual homebuyers are pulling back: high borrowing costs, elevated home prices and economic uncertainty. It\u2019s more expensive for investors to finance their purchases than it has been in the past. Even though most investors pay in cash and don\u2019t take out mortgages to buy homes, they often take on other loans to fund things like renovations, and interest rates are much higher than they were during the pandemic. Additionally, home prices remain [near record highs](https://www.redfin.com/news/homes-sell-at-slowest-pace-in-decade/). Asking rents have also [declined from their peak](https://www.redfin.com/news/rental-tracker-july-2025/) in much of the country. Additionally, the short-term rental market has [cooled](https://www.redfin.com/news/vacation-towns-home-sales-declining/) in some areas amid tightened regulations.

Monthly rental prices range from \u00a393 ($128), if you commit to a three-year-long rental period, to \u00a3277 ($382), if you only commit to a one-month rental period. Under the three-year plan, you can rent the TV for 27 months before you end up paying more to rent the TV than you would have to own it. **At the highest rate, your rental payments will surpass MSRP after nine months.** My take: LG is cutting out the \"rent-to-own\" (e.g. Rent-A-Center) and \"buy now, pay later\" (e.g. Klarna) middlemen by directly participating in the rental business to claim that sweet, sweet reoccurring revenue stream. Also, the Arstechnica comments are hilarious. With some discussing how back in the day when color CRTs were extremely expensive, Radio Rentals would offer coin-operated TVs to be installed in people's homes.",

It refers to a person (or people) within the studio who, as the name suggests, simply contributes ideas but doesn't consider how they might affect the overall game. Why am I mentioning this? Because Highguard feels like a game made by the idea man. It's not a bad game per se, but... it has so many things that make you wonder why they're even there. Why is the map so big? Why is there mining? Why is there a phase where you defend your base but you can't place turrets, traps, or other types of defenses? And why did they use the character with the most generic design in the game as the face of the game? I reiterate, it's not a bad video game, but it's just not polished, and now with so much competition in the market, not being polished can be a death sentence. I feel that the best thing they could have done was delay it and do alphas (the same thing Bungie did) and then release the game with a better advertising campaign. I think many CEO feel like we're still in 2018, in the sense that they can release an unpolished game as a service and think we'll support them until they have their Taken King/Forsaken moment, but that's no longer the case. P.S: This game has a revolver weapon with different tiers. The problem is that the model has six barrels in all tiers, so you can have a gold revolver with 18 bullets, but the model still only has six barrels. It's stupid to complain about this, but damn, it drives me crazy.",

I say \u201cagain,\u201d as this is the second time Nintendo has slipped Wooly World into something marketing a future product. [ https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/s/mnjrtAsgWq ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/s/mnjrtAsgWq) There was this instance from nearly a year ago, and here again, Wooly World appears in the most recent Mario Galaxy Movie direct.

I\u2019d argue it\u2019s really odd considering of the games shown, Wooly World is the only one not available on Switch. Every other game they show is available, but they oddly chose Wooly World of all games? Not Crafted World, which has been on the Switch for 7 years now, but the Wii U game that\u2019s 11 years old? Let alone one of the very few Wii U games that isn\u2019t yet on Switch? Hell it would\u2019ve made more sense to show his upcoming game. Again, take it with a grain of salt, but I think it\u2019s weird this is now the second time Wooly World has appeared in content directly from Nintendo advertising future material.",

They definitely show Crafted World too though right after Woolly World since Yoshi is made from felt. I really hope they do a Switch 1 port and of it and a Switch 2 upgrade for both. I could see it happening 6 months after the new Yoshi game, like DKCRHD had a Switch 2 upgrade after Bananza.

Directed by Connie He, the film follows Ada, a sleep-deprived woman whose frustration with noisy neighbors spirals into surreal, expressionistic hallucinations. The project is a collaboration between veteran animators and Google DeepMind researchers, with a core goal: **use AI to amplify artists\u2019 creative control, not replace it**. Key takeaways: * **Artist-first pipeline:** The creative vision came first. Storyboards, character designs, and painterly styles were fully defined by human artists before AI entered the process. * **Custom-trained models:** Researchers fine-tuned Veo (video) and Imagen (image) models on the artists\u2019 own artwork, teaching the AI highly specific visual styles and character rules from just a few examples. * **Video-to-video over text prompts:** Instead of relying on text prompts, animators created rough 2D or 3D animations in familiar tools (Maya, TVPaint). AI then transformed these into fully stylized shots while preserving timing, motion, and performance. * **Iterative, film-style workflow:** Shots went through dailies, critiques, and multiple revisions. New tools allowed localized edits to parts of a frame without regenerating entire scenes. * **AI as a collaborator:** The models handled hard-to-animate expressionist styles, improvised creative details when guided (like extra hair tufts), and scaled shots to 4K while preserving artistic nuance. * **Mutual learning:** Artists gained new expressive capabilities; researchers gained hands-on experience shaping AI as a filmmaking tool. **Bottom line:** The film demonstrates a hybrid future for animation where generative AI functions like a powerful new brush or effects pipeline\u2014guided tightly by human intent, integrated into existing workflows, and used to unlock visual styles that would be prohibitively difficult with traditional methods alone.",

But part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach. What\u2019s happening with ICE is going too far. There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what\u2019s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right. > > President Trump is a very strong leader, and I hope he will rise to this moment and unite the country. I am encouraged by the last few hours of response and hope to see trust rebuilt with transparent investigations. > > As a company, we aim to stick to our convictions and not get blown around by changing fashions too much. We didn\u2019t become super woke when that was popular, we didn\u2019t start talking about masculine corporate energy when that was popular, and we are not going to make a lot of performative statements now about safety or politics or anything else. But we are going to continue to try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best as we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed. > The post garnered hundreds of supportive responses, including heart and \u201cTHANK YOU\u201d emojis. In the replies, Altman said that he had spent time talking with Trump administration officials yesterday, as he had done in the fall when he was one of several San Francisco business leaders asked to help persuade Trump not to conduct a big immigration enforcement action in the city.",

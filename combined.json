        "score": 87,
        "text_content": "Bit of a rant here, after the recent introduction of the [Dimensity 7100](https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones/mediatek-dimensity-7100). **TL;DR:** MediaTek just assigns random numbers in their 7000-series, with no logic for either tiering or generations at all. \\----- First some context: MediaTek's Dimensity 7000-series is supposed to be their mid-range SoCs, but they can be found in phones from $/\u20ac399 all the way to $/\u20ac150. So it's mid-range *and* low-end, making it immediately questionable what the 6000 series is doing at all. So Q1 2023 the 7000 started with the Dimensity 7200. Made perfect sense considering the 8200 was just released in the previous quarter. Nice, modern start: TSMC N4P process, ARMv9-A CPU cores, modern reasonably sized Mali-G610 MC4 GPU. No notes at all. Perfect mid-ranger. Later the same quarter, the 7020 joined, which was simply a renamed Dimensity 930. Clearly lower-end with TSMC 6nm and ARMv8 CPU cores. Already a bit weird, why not name it 6000-something? 6200 was available at the time, and still is. Okay that happened. The reasonable thing to do now is to have a lower end 70x0 series and a higher-end 7x00 series. Confusing at first, but understandable and consistent. At least they started both at \"2\", implying consistent generation numbering. Q2 2023. We're not even 3 months further, and now joins: Dimensity 7050. A renamed Dimensity 1080. Basically the 7020 with another GPU. I can't make sense of this. At all. We're 3 chips in a brand new naming scheme and it's already confusing as hell. *Three* chips. Q3 2023. The Dimensity 1050 gets renamed to Dimensity 7030. Somehow it has a more modern GPU than the just launched 7050. If this is just a bit \"1000 series renaming scheme\", shouldn't it make stuff clearer. That was 2023: 4 chips, one big mess. 2024: In Q1 MediaTek is clearly recovering themselves, since no new 7000 SoCs launch. Apparently there are no 1000 series chips left to rename. Q2 the Dimensity 7300 gets launched. A clear successor to the 7200 right. *Right?* *Wrong!* It goes a full generation back to ARMv8 CPU cores. Meanwhile, the GPU is a generation newer but half the size. It's also now TSMC N4 instead of the slightly more powerful TSMC N4P. The Dimensity 7025 also launches in Q2 2024, which is an overclocked 7020. Perfectly fine. So 700x bumps are for overclocks noted. So remember: An overclocked SoC gets bumped by 5. A naming convention introduced right this year, 2024. *A overclocked SoC gets bumped by 5.* Q3 2025: Dimensity 7350 launches, an overclocked 7200. Wait, what? Yes: The Dimensity 7350 is based on the same silicon as the 7200, not as the 7300. We're right back to where we started, TSMC N4P process, ARMv9-A CPU cores, Mali-G610 MC4 GPU. Just clocked a bit faster. This thing should have been called 7205. It would have made perfect sense. 7250 would have gotten a pass. 7350 is just madness. Welcome to 2025! This year will be better, right. *Right*? We start of right with the Dimensity 7400. Ah, finally a new proper flagship for the 7000 series. Wrong. It's an overclocked 7300. By now old ARMv8 architecture, tiny GPU. So yes: An overclock is now marked by either 5, 100, or 150. Take your pick. Q2 gives us the Dimensity 7060. Overclocked 7050, probably? No, it's an overclocked *7020*. So apparently you can also just skip some numbers and bump by 40 to mark an overclock. Fun fact: The 7060 is a 2025 SoC with Wi-Fi *5*. So not 7. Not 6E. Not 6. Wi-Fi 5. From 2013. Q3 2025: Dimensity 7360. Overclocked 7350 right? Wrong, it's an overclocked 7300. For who's keeping track: You can mark an overclock now by either bumping by 5, 40, 60, 100 or 150. Then we arrive at our current point, the Dimensity 7100 launch, just in the last days of Q4 2025. Silently, because I also would be ashamed of this mess. It's an... new SoC? I mean it's old, almost ancient: TSMC 6nm, ARMv8 (4x Cortex-A78, 4x A55, Mali-G610 MC2), 32-bit LPDDR4X. It kind on resembles at Dimensity 7300 or 7400 with a generation older GPU. But I can't find this exact combination anywhere. This can't be how you design a new chip in late 2025, right? I have to be missing something. Let's end on that total note of confusion. **TL;DR 2**: MediaTek gave up after SoC number 3, after less than half a year, and now just YOLOs the 7000 series numbers. And remember: *Always* mark you overclocks with either bumping by 5, 40, 60, 100 or 150. \\----- I like to hate on Qualcomm and their cringe \"Gen\" naming. I *despise* their \"s\" naming, in which a 7s chip is worse than a 7 series chip - and often way worse, hiding the huge difference for regular consumers. But MediaTek's 7000 series is just an unmitigated mess I believe even they themselves gave up on.",

Also a bit odd IMO to have the Ryzen 9s in the \"middle\" of the pack with the HX 370 and HX 365, but there's at least a clear progression up in both CPU and GPU performance for most models. The 385 having less CPU cores than the 365 and 370 is weird but it's at least making up for it with quad-channel RAM. X Elite Snapdragons? Maybe just weird because we're not used to them yet, it's only been one generation. The X1E, X1P, X1 segmentation makes sense, and the numbers that follow at least seem to climb in a way that somewhat indicates things have improved as you go up. I hope 2nd-gen just increments that first number by 1 and leaves the rest mostly alone. X2E, X2P, and X2 will work fine.

The summary: - These 2026 QD-OLED panels now feature the V-Stripe ([a.k.a. \"True RGB\"](https://tftcentral.co.uk/news/samsung-display-announce-mass-production-of-new-34-qd-oled-panel-with-v-stripe-sub-pixel-layout)) Sub-Pixel Layout. Text quality is \"effectively identical to LCDs of the same pixel density\", by far the biggest upgrade from these new panels. As described by Tim, there's no \"green and pink fringing at the top and bottom of text edges\" from older QD-OLED panels, and there's also no \"horizontal shadowing\" from W-OLED's \"RWBG & RGWB pixel layouts\". - Screen coating doesn't raise black levels as much as 1st and 2nd generation QD-OLED, but the issue still persists. A 4th Gen Tandem WOLED panel with a \"TrueBlack\" screen coating handle black raise the best, although the coating on those panels is far glossier than the one found on QD-OLED. Tim prefered the coating of 5th QD-OLED over the \"True Black\" 4th Gen Tandem WOLED. - HDR brightness values with their APL (Window) values, according to Tim's testing: \"Around 300nits\" at 100%, \"Around 520nits\" at 10%, \"Around 1300nits\" at 2%. SDR brightness can go up to 307 nits. - 5th-Gen QD-OLED 3440x1440 Panels now feature a 360Hz refresh rate. Tim highlighted the better compatibility with 4x MFG DLSS Frame Generation than with an older 175Hz Panel. - Samsung's aggresive ABL is still present on these new panels, but both ASUS and MSI have added some hacks in their OSDs to try to work around the aggresive ABL. Monitors Unboxed will touch on this in the future, but [HDTVTest already has an excellent video on the MSI's hack implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9P2TaU0vg). - EDIT: From the TFTCentral articles that I shared at the beginning, both monitors share the same Semi-Glossy coating (despite the marketing name used by ASUS and MSI), an 1800R curve, improved panel hardness from 2H to 3H, VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 500 certification, \"factory calibrated Delta<2 accuracy\", 2x HDMI 2.1 ports and a USB-C Type C port with 90W of Power Delivery. The MSI monitor features a single DisplayPort 2.1, UHBR13.5-tier port at $1,099. The ASUS features a single DisplayPort 2.1, UHBR20-tier port with no announced MSRP. Overall, I'm really glad that text fringing seems to be solved on both 5th Gen QD-OLED and [Tandem WOLED RGB-Stripe monitors](https://tftcentral.co.uk/news/lg-display-announce-a-new-27-4k-oled-panel-with-rgb-stripe-layout). Unlike the RGB-Stripe 4th Gen Tandem WOLED which have brightness levels comparable to 1st Gen QD-OLED (1000nits@2% APL, 500nits@10% APL, 250nits@100% APL), 5th Gen QD-OLED will be far brighter while having a (mostly) similar text quality, from the info that we have so far. For those interested on more monitor reviews that are not from the usual sources (Monitors Unboxed, TFT Central, HDTVTest), you can wait for a future review from chinese reviewer [\u5c0f\u96ea\u4eba\u8bc4\u6d4b](https://www.youtube.com/@%E5%B0%8F%E9%9B%AA%E4%BA%BA%E8%AF%84%E6%B5%8B/videos) to check how text-fringing shows up on more complex chinese characters as well as Stroboscopic Visibility Measure (SVM) testing and a tear-down of the monitors.",

        "score": 73,
        "text_content": "While I understand that Metroid Prime 4 may have benefited from the fact that it was initially developed for the Switch 1 hardware, essentially giving it a ton of headroom on the Switch 2 in order to be able to hit 120fps, I really hope we get at least a few more titles that can hit this since I think I could significantly enhance the overall feel of certain games. The first one that comes to mind is whatever the next mainline Splatoon game is. Sure, 60fps is fine but when it comes to the chaotic nature of Splatoon, having the game running at 120fos would really give the player the edge in terms of soaking in all of the action happening on screen. I also think that in my limited experience playing games at 120fps, is lot less of how it looks and more about how it *feels*. What I mean by that is, the responsiveness that you get out of something like gyro controls or even mouse aiming, (if that\u2019s supported) would make the game feel insanely response and even more enjoyable to play. I stand pretty strongly by the fact that Splatoon 4 would actually have a very tangible benefit whereas maybe a lot of other games it might seem like overkill. What games do you think would benefit from having a 120fps mode besides the fact that it\u2019s more than 60, games that would maybe benefit from such?",

I think most games will target 60fps but yeah I\u2019d love for a game like Splatoon 4 to have a 120fps option, think that could be big for Smash bros too. Anything that\u2019s super competitive should have the toggle option with it being known you\u2019re sacrificing visuals significantly",

In other words, this trademark renewal clearly, clearly means absolutely *nothing* in terms of any sort of rerelease of the game.

READ BEFORE POSTING \u2014 READ BEFORE POSTING \u2014 READ BEFORE POSTING If you are experiencing any issues, including, but not limited to; games or programs crashing, system crashes or hangs, blue screens of death (BSoD), driver timeouts, system not starting, system freezes, data corruption, system shutting down unexpectedly, visual artifacts, lower than expected performance or any other issue, please read and try the following before making a post \u2014 the majority of problems can be resolved by trying the steps listed below. The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order. If a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step. If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet, and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth checking your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet. If you have any power-related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting, or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB, and 3.3V rails) can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose. Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual. If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM, and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers/buttons you can use; please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS. If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on. Make sure your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have \u2014 most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which will allow you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual, as the BIOS flashback procedure will vary depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB. Make sure your Monitor/TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor/TV if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters, or splitters. Remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort, and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables. Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games, and applications. Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware, and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs, and other performance, security, stability, and compatibility issues. Make sure you are running the latest Intel drivers. Some devices, such as laptops and handhelds, may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturer's support page. If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers. A guide on how to use DDU can be found here If you have installed GPU drivers after using DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again. If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like here), please view the following on the steps you can take to prevent this from happening. If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering, or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues \u2014 more information on disabling MPO is available in this thread. If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, EA App, GOG Galaxy, Battle.net or whichever game client you are using. If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly, or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller. If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values. This can be checked under Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options. Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware, and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop, and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features, and improve compatibility and interoperability. If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP \u2014 to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings \u2014 this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities. If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them. A guide is available here If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the below PSU calculators and make sure the PSU you have (or intend to buy) can supply enough power when your system is under full load \u2014 If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load. PSU Calculators: FSP \u2014 OuterVision \u2014 Cooler Master \u2014 Seasonic \u2014 Newegg \u2014 be quiet! \u2014 MSI \u2014 You can also add all your components into PCPartPicker and it will provide an estimate of wattage. Try to apply common sense to an issue, for example, if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, the DIMM slot on the motherboard, or the pins? Have you tried reseating it, etc... If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdowns, or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Remember that just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system \u2014 many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it. OCCT \u2014 OCCT is the only comprehensive stability testing software available. 20 years of experience have proved OCCT to be the community's software of choice in terms of stability and performance testing. CPU, GPU, Memory, VRAM, and Power supplies are tested in the most efficient and accurate way possible. If there's anything wrong, we'll find it and report it. OCCT includes many advanced features, ranging from per-core CPU testing to varying GPU loads, and much more. Prime95 \u2014 Prime95 has been a popular choice for stress/torture testing a CPU since its introduction, especially with overclockers and system builders. Since the software makes heavy use of the processor's integer and floating point instructions, it feeds the processor a consistent and verifiable workload to test the stability of the CPU and the L1/L2/L3 processor cache. Additionally, it uses all of the cores of a multi-CPU / multi-core system to ensure a high-load stress test environment. AIDA64 Extreme \u2014 AIDA64 Extreme is an industry-leading system information tool, loved by PC enthusiasts around the world, which not only provides extremely detailed information about both hardware and installed software, but also helps users diagnose issues and offers benchmarks to measure the performance of the computer. Furmark 2 \u2014 FurMark 2 is the successor of the venerable FurMark 1 and is a very intensive GPU stress test on Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and Linux (32-bit and 64-bit) platforms. It's also a quick OpenGL and Vulkan graphics benchmark with online scores. FurMark 2 has an improved command line support and is built with GeeXLab. MSI Kombustor \u2014 MSI Kombustor is MSI's exclusive burn-in benchmarking tool based on the well-known FurMark software. This program is specifically designed to push your graphics card to the limits to test stability and thermal performance. Kombustor supports cutting-edge 3D APIs such as OpenGL or Vulkan. MemTest86 \u2014 MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns. Bad RAM is one of the most frustrating computer problems to have, as symptoms are often random and hard to pin down. MemTest86 can help diagnose faulty RAM (or rule it out as a cause of system instability). As such it is often used by system builders, PC repair stores, overclockers & PC manufacturers. MemTest86+ \u2014 Memtest86+ is a stand-alone memory tester for x86 and x86-64 architecture computers. It provides a more thorough memory check than that provided by BIOS memory tests. Memtest86+ can be loaded and run either directly by a PC BIOS (legacy or UEFI) or via an intermediate bootloader that supports the Linux 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, or EFI handover boot protocol. It should work on any Pentium-class or later 32-bit or 64-bit x86 CPU. SeaTools \u2014 Quickly determine the condition of the drive in your computer with this comprehensive, easy-to-use diagnostic. For more advanced SSD and HDD diagnostic utilities, please check the website of your SSD or HDD manufacturer, as they usually offer manufacturer-specific software to check the health of he drive, test the drive and update firmware, some examples include Samsung Magician, Western Digital Dashboard and the Crucial Storage Executive. Some motherboards, laptops, and desktops may also have built-in BIOS diagnostic utilities to stress test certain components or the entire system. Please consult your motherboard or system manual for more information. A truly stable system should be able to run any of these utilities or built-in diagnostics without any crashes, freezes, errors, or other issues. These utilities can help you narrow down which component(s) in your system are faulty, aren't installed correctly, or have unstable overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves, etc... If you require help using any of these programs, please read the help sections on each website or use Google and YouTube, as there are a plethora of guides and tutorials available. If you have tried all of the above and are still facing the same issue, please backup any important files/data and perform a reinstall/clean install of Windows, using a USB or DVD.

        "score": 45,
        "text_content": "I was bored this Saturday so I decided to create a new LLM Blokus benchmark. If you don't know, Blokus is a 4-player game where the object is control as much territory with your pieces as possible. Players must start by playing a piece that touches their starting corner, and subsequent moves must touch a corner of one of their pieces while not touching a side of any of their pieces. Each LLM plays as blue, and simply plays against 4 opponents who randomly select a legal move (though for now LLMs are bad enough for the presence of an opponent to not mean much). On each turn they are given 3 tries to make a legal move, after which they forfeit and aren't allowed to move anymore. The board is represented visually, and the LLMs make moves by selecting a piece, choosing how much to rotate it, and choosing the coordinates that piece's starred square will be placed on. This benchmark demands a lot of model's visual reasoning: they must mentally rotate pieces, count coordinates properly, keep track of each piece's starred square, and determine the relationship between different pieces on the board. I think it will be a while before this benchmark is saturated, so I will be excited to evaluate new models as they come out. I score models by total number of squares covered, so the leaderboard is: 1. GPT 5.2: 18 2. Gemini 3 Pro: 15 3. Claude Opus 4.5: 5 4. Llama 4 Maverick: 1",

The first two moves were fine but then it made awful decisions llama 4 started with the absolute worst possible move so I see why it scored low Clearly Gemini is making the best moves by far though and the results and scores are entirely due to allowing them to not move at all when they fail to make a valid move and not about their actual placement skill. I feel like if you did 100 games for each and didn't allow skipped turns then the results would be very different. Gemini is starting with more difficult pieces and moving into the free spaces better and is just clearly the best from this sample set but we'd need a larger sample size to know for sure.",

They are open source, and designed with privacy, speed and performance in mind. What do these new LLMs do? given a user request and the conversation context, Plano-Orchestrator decides which agent(s) should handle the request and in what sequence. In other words, it acts as the supervisor agent in a multi-agent system. Designed for multi-domain scenarios, it works well across general chat, coding tasks, and long, multi-turn conversations, while staying efficient enough for low-latency production deployments. Why did we built this? Our applied research is focused on helping teams deliver agents safely and efficiently, with better real-world performance and latency \u2014 the kind of \u201cglue work\u201d that usually sits outside any single agent\u2019s core product logic.

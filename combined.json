        "text_content": "Recently I read this article on CNBC - \"Micron said on Wednesday that it plans to ***stop selling memory to consumers*** to focus on providing enough memory for high-powered AI chips.\" This coupled with the recent shortages of RAM for consumers and subsequent rise in their prices has got me worried. If this trend continues and AI race actually takes off, where does that leave normal PC enthusiasts / DIY culture that started in 1980's. We can't assemble computers without RAM, SSDs or GPUs. Plus, the recent thrust by both Intel and AMD to go for APU / integrated architecture makes me believe that the industry is pushing consumers towards locked hardware that cannot be customized, and we all would eventually be forced to use NUCs or laptops that come with soldered RAM and CPU or even worse, integrated SOC with GPU. If that is the world we are being forced into, I think we may need an alternate way getting these components. I don't know what the way could be forward, but breaking up of monopoly of few big companies like Microsoft and NVidia can certainly help. Would love to know your views on how this thing will eventually play out. Do you think that this AI bubble will eventually pop bringing normalcy or can this bring out seismic shift in how we see computers?",

Even then, we had the perception that Crucial was like 1% of their business and an afterthought. They were also the owner of SD Card manufacturer Lexar, before they sold it to a company in China maybe 8-10 years ago. Same thought process, it was just even smaller of a piece of their business. Then maybe 6 years ago they moved Crucial's customer service out of the US, so more fat trimming. Crucial finally closing is just a business efficiency decision, and they can focus more on B2B so that other companies can sell consumer products.",

After her death in the prologue, her body is taken by Victor Yurichenko, one of the villains of the game. > Victor Y. has two assistants: a girl named Ellen and his henchman, nicknamed \u201cPalach.\u201d > Leon S. Kennedy will participate in the game in two distinct phases: first in the search for the alleged villain Victor, investigated by the United States government for his connection to Operation Elpis, which seeks secret groups linked to the past of Umbrella and Raccoon City. The second part of Leon's participation will be later in the plot, in the rescue of Grace Ashcroft. > Yoko Suzuki and Claire Redfield have minor roles in the story. During the game, Jill Valentine and Sherry Birkin are mentioned as important survivors of the Raccoon City incident. > The game has about 6 main bosses, 3 of which are faced by Leon, and the other 3 by Grace. > Some creatures such as Lickers, G-Types, and Drain Deimos return with a more deteriorated appearance and minor mutations. > The virus in the game is called Elanthropus, derived from Victor Yurichenko's research on mold and the progenitor virus. The virus maintains the host's consciousness in some infected individuals, causing exaggerated transformation in others. > The game has about 18 hours of campaign play, and will also feature an extra mode similar to mercenaries mode. > The Connections will play a surprise role in the game, helping Leon to find Grace and stop a large infection in Rhodes Hill. The info about Leon's campaign seems to match what Dusk Golem said (his campaign being set mostly in the past, him rescuing Grace, etc...). As always, it's 4chan.

                "raw_content": "KEY POINTS * Challenger, Gray & Christmas said layoff plans totaled 71,321 in November, a step down from the massive cuts announced in October but still enough to bring the 2025 total up to 1.17 million. * The most-cited reason for the month was restructuring, followed by closings and market or economic conditions. Announced job cuts from U.S. employers moved further ahead of 1 million for the year in November as corporate restructuring, artificial intelligence and tariffs have helped pare job rolls, consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday. The firm said layoff plans totaled 71,321 in November, a step down from the massive cuts announced in October but still enough to bring the 2025 total up to 1.17 million. That total is 54% higher than the same 11-month period a year ago and the highest level since 2020, when the Covid pandemic rocked the global economy. In November, Verizon\u2019s announcement that it would slash more than 13,000 jobs helped drive the total. Tech companies, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence, listed 12,377 reductions, pushing the sector\u2019s 2025 total up 17% from a year ago. AI itself has been cited for 54,694 layoffs this year. Tariffs were cited as the driver of more than 2,000 cuts in November and nearly 8,000 year to date. The most-cited reason for the month was restructuring, followed by closings and market or economic conditions. \u201cLayoff plans fell last month, certainly a positive sign. That said, job cuts in November have risen above 70,000 only twice since 2008: in 2022 and in 2008,\u201d said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Challenger also pointed out that since the financial crisis in 2008, companies have shifted away from end-year layoff announcements. \u201cIt was the trend to announce layoff plans toward the end of the year, to align with most companies\u2019 fiscal year-ends. It became unpopular after the Great Recession especially, and best practice dictated layoff plans would occur at times other than the holidays,\u201d said Challenger. November offered some relief from the more than 153,000 cuts announced in October, which was the highest total for the month in 22 years. The numbers come with concerns rising over the state of the U.S. labor market. ADP reported Wednesday that private employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, the biggest decline in more than 2\u00bd years. Hiring prospects have been dim this year as well, according to the Challenger report. Employers have announced 497,151 planned hires, off 35% from the same point in 2024. Despite signs of weakness elsewhere, Labor Department data has yet to reflect a surge in layoffs. The department on Thursday reported that weekly jobless claims unexpectedly tumbled to 191,000, the lowest in more than three years. Official data showed the decline of some 27,000 from the prior week was driven by unusually large drops in California and Texas and likely was influenced by the Thanksgiving holiday.",

Insights from Chief Economist Dr. Selma Hepp As 2025 draws to a close, we reflect on a year defined by moderation and shifting dynamics in the housing market. This year began with a stable growth trajectory, with national price growth posting an annual increase of 3.4% in January. However, that momentum slowed steadily as the year progressed. By October, annual appreciation was a mere 1.1% annual increase\u2014the lowest rate since early 2012. \"The housing market in 2025 demonstrated remarkable resilience despite significant headwinds. Slowing price growth reflects a much-needed rebalancing after years of unsustainable gains. While some markets are experiencing declines, these adjustments will help restore affordability over time and make housing more accessible to a wider group of buyers,\u201d said Cotality\u2019s Chief Economist Dr. Selma Hepp. This deceleration highlights the impact of higher mortgage rates earlier in the year and persistent affordability challenges. Furthermore, price growth was dampened by a notable increase in inventory. Many markets saw a surge in both existing and newly built homes, slowing rates of in-migration and weakened demand. The robust price increases of 2022 when top metros \u2014 primarily in Florida and the Southeast \u2014 saw gains exceeding 30% has now given way to declines. At the start of 2025, only six metros \u2014 primarily in Florida \u2014 posted year-over-year drops. By October, that number surged to 32, as pricing downturns extended into Texas, California, and various states throughout the Mountain West. Even areas that did see appreciating price growth recorded muted gains. Appreciation trends among the top 100 metros varied widely. Rochester, New York led in January with a 9% annual increase, but by October, Bridgeport, Connecticut took the top spot with an 8% gain. \u201cLooking ahead, regional differences will remain pronounced, with demand favoring areas that offer both economic opportunity and relative affordability. In general, home price growth is projected to remain below the long-running average of 4% to 5%. However, mortgage rates will play a critical role in shaping the 2026 housing market. A notable drop in mortgage rates combined with low supply could lead to a re-acceleration of price gains.\" -Dr. Selma Hepp Cotality\u2019s Chief Economist",

This could make high-end AI cheaper for everyone to use. * Real-Time Reasoning: Complex tasks that used to take too long for a chatbot (like analyzing a whole book or writing complex code live) might now become instantaneous. In short: NVIDIA built a specialized home for the specific type of AI architecture (MoE) that everyone is using today, and it makes that AI run 10x faster.",

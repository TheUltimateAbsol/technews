Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (yeah, the Mounjaro company) just got approval for a wearable called the 'Magnol.Ai Band'. But get this - it's an *ankle-worn* device.

The name and placement scream AI-powered gait or mobility analysis for drug trials. We won't get to see photos for a while since they're confidential, but it's a fascinating piece of purpose-built hardware from a non-tech company.

A one-meter strand has processing power comparable to a classic computer CPU. **\"Sushi Roll\" Design:** Unlike traditional rigid silicon chips, researchers used a multilayered spiral architecture, rolling thin circuit layers onto an elastic substrate like a sushi roll to maximize internal space. **Extreme Durability:** Beyond withstanding 15.6 tons of pressure, the fiber can **survive** 10,000 bending cycles, stretching by 30%, and temperatures up to 100\u00b0C. It is also machine-washable. **Applications:** The technology is intended for smart textiles (clothing that acts as a computer), brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to its softness and immersive VR gloves that provide tactile feedback. **Source:** [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/sun-shanghai-scientists-create-computer-chip-in-fiber-thinner-than-a-human-hair-touted-as-ideal-for-brain-computer-interfaces-vr-wearables-and-smart-textiles) / [SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3341025/chinese-scientists-shrink-semiconductor-chip-fibre-thin-human-hair)",

        "text_content": "I just learned about the ASUS 4060 Ti card which had an M.2 slot on it. This seemed like an excellent idea: * Utilizes PCIe lanes that are unused by the card and would otherwise be 'wasted'. * Provides almost unmatched cooling for the SSD. * Provides additional M.2 slot (which motherboards in lower price brackets may have fewer of). * Even if the motherboard does have spare M.2 slots, they may be Gen 4 ones running off a congested chipset. The graphics card solution will be Gen 5 lanes connected directly to the CPU. When I looked to see if ASUS had repeated this for the current generation, all I found was a 5080 ProArt SSD edition which seems to have been vaporware and makes far less sense in the first place (5080 isn't an 8x card, so you're robbing lanes from the GPU, people with 5080s are less likely to have M.2-starved motherboards, etc.) So why was this concept so short-lived? Was it related to patchy PCIe bifurcation support on motherboards making the whole thing more trouble than it was worth for ASUS?",

        "text_content": "An additional blurb has been added to the description of KCD1 in PSN Italia, alongside a slightly retouched and recolored keyart image. Translated to English it reads: *The PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical upgrades including 4K resolution, an improved frame rate, high-resolution textures, and much more.* *Medieval Bohemia has never looked so beautiful.* EDIT: This change appears to have taken effect across several/all PAL region PlayStation stores (thanks u/salromano for pointing out) Doesn't make clear whether it's a native version or a 4K/60 patch, though the discovery of a PS5 listing on the store last summer would indicate it's more likely a native version. Personally hoping it's a native version and supports save transfer from PS4. Recent discussion on r/kingdomcome has indicated the upgrade is targeting a February release. I believe this originated from a \"my friend works at Warhorse\" type of claim, with no previous track-record other than some correct predictions about KCD2 being delayed into 2025. But it's all we have to go on, and this new activity on the KCD store listing may back that up.

After dropping sharply, mortgage interest rates rose last week for the first time in a month. That pushed total mortgage demand down 8.5% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, increased to 6.24% from 6.16%, with points rising to 0.55 from 0.54, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the highest rate in three weeks. As a result, applications to refinance a home loan dropped 16% for the week, but they were still 156% higher than the same week one year ago. That is because rates a year ago were 78 basis points higher. \u201cFHA refinance activity bucked the overall trend and increased, as FHA rates remained almost 20 basis points lower than conforming rates,\u201d said Joel Kan, MBA\u2019s vice president and deputy chief economist, in a release. \u201cWith rates holding in the 6 percent range, the refinance market is likely to remain sensitive to week-to-week rate movements.\u201d Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home were essentially flat, down 0.4% from one week earlier and 18% higher year over year. Homebuyers are still facing a very pricey market. There is more supply than last year, but most of it is on the high end. \u201cThe average loan size stayed at its highest level since September 2025,\u201d Kan added. Mortgage rates moved slightly lower to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. The next chance for a sizeable move in rates in either direction comes Wednesday with the latest meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Most expect it to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, but markets will be ready to react to commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",

That's like holding a garage sale, and then having to buy your own shit back after no one else takes it. You can't raise your garage sale's prices after that. The Fed is as low as they can go right now. They can't cut the short-term rate if they wanted to, even if they didn't care about inflation (they don't). As far as housing, the 10 year spread is trading tight vs the overnight rate (as tight as you can go after 5 years of over-target inflation with no end in sight), and mortgage spreads are historically normal vs the 10 year. In other words - mortgage rates are about as low as they can go too. There may be another quarter-point to squeeze if mortgage spreads vs Treasurys go from \"normal\" to \"historically tight\", but the risk is all to the upside at this point. Everyone's waiting on pins and needles for 2010s mortgage rates to come back, but they can never come back unless we get 2010s-style 1% inflation prints. It's that simple. If inflation is at 3%, the Fed can't move the overnight rate to under 3%, which means that you won't get long-duration rates under 4%, which means you won't get mortgage rates under 6%.",

                "raw_content": "Key findings: - Zillow identified the most buyer-friendly housing markets of 2026 among the 50 largest U.S. metros. - Indianapolis ranks No. 1 among 50 metros for buyer-friendly housing conditions in 2026. Atlanta, Charlotte, Jacksonville and Oklahoma City round out the top five most buyer-friendly housing markets. - Indianapolis offers the best combination of affordability relative to local incomes, home value upside and lower competition according to Zillow\u2019s Market Heat Index. After several years of tough conditions for buyers, there are reasons for optimism in 2026. Zillow\u2019s outlook for 2026 calls for the housing market to settle into a healthier state, with buyers seeing a bit more breathing room. But the housing market isn\u2019t moving in lockstep nationwide. An inventory crunch is creating competition among buyers in some markets \u2014 including Hartford, Zillow\u2019s hottest housing market of 2026 \u2014 while strained affordability is limiting buyers in others. To help identify where conditions may be most favorable, Zillow ranked the most buyer-friendly housing markets of 2026. The ranking is designed to highlight places where buyers are more likely to find a balanced mix of opportunity and sustainability \u2014 not just lower prices, but a friendlier overall buying experience. Buyers in these markets can expect to see more homes within budget, while forecasted appreciation suggests strong long-term financial potential. With less competition for each home, buyers have more time to make decisions and a lower risk of being pulled into stressful bidding wars. What the Top Markets Have in Common Most of Zillow\u2019s top 10 buyer-friendly markets are in the Midwest and the Sun Belt. Midwest housing markets generally avoided the steepest pandemic-era price run-ups, helping maintain their relative affordability. In the Sun Belt, new construction booms have helped inventory recover and eased competition for each home. In 5 of the 10 markets, a median household can afford a typical home \u2014 meaning a mortgage costs below 30% of income, assuming a 20% down payment. Buyers will still have to make tradeoffs to find a home in their budget that fits their needs, but with more inventory, more time and more latitude to negotiate on price, they will have more control over that process. Zillow\u2019s most buyer-friendly markets of 2026: 1. Indianapolis 2. Atlanta 3. Charlotte 4. Jacksonville 5. Oklahoma City 6. Memphis 7. Detroit 8. Miami 9. Tampa 10. Pittsburgh 11. Columbus 12. Nashville 13. Orlando 14. Louisville 15. Houston See the top 49 cities below: https://www.zillow.com/research/best-markets-home-buyers-2026-35971/",

For most of history, progress looks flat. Thousands of years of tiny, incremental improvements. Then it starts to curve\u2026 slowly. Agriculture, industry, electricity, computing. Still feels manageable, still feels \u201chuman-paced.\u201d That\u2019s the long, boring bit on the left. The key thing people miss is that exponential growth doesn\u2019t feel exponential while you\u2019re in it. It feels underwhelming right up until it doesn\u2019t. For a long time, each step forward looks like \u201cmeh, slightly better than last year.\u201d Then suddenly the curve goes vertical, not because something magical happened at that moment, **but because all the compounding finally stacks.** The singularity isn\u2019t \u201cAI suddenly becomes a god overnight.\u201d It\u2019s the point where progress becomes so steep and self-reinforcing that human intuition, institutions, and timelines stop being useful tools for prediction. The jump looks absurd only in hindsight. So when people say \u201cthis doesn\u2019t feel that fast\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ve been overhyped before,\u201d that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect if you\u2019re standing near the little stick figure on the graph, right before the wall.

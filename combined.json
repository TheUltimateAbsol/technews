If there were still a u/TwelveSilverSwords around, I'd like to see an analysis on ppa of these cores. Top of my head I don't know the sizes of PTL's compute tile and X2E's die. As for GPU, this is interesting. Just a few samples, but it's no slouch (not like before with X1). Possibly more driver improvements (also check out [ARM64EC](https://youtu.be/3yDXyW1WERg?si=mxaZfuGsSv87zHFD&t=1895))and the flagship X2Ee yet to be seen, this'll be def interesting to follow.

He is comparing the X2E 88 (18C, nearly highest X2E clocks) vs the X1E 78 (12C, slowest X1E SKU, **no Turbo**). I do not know why this problem affects many laptop reviewers. Desktop reviews usually get it. Nobody would test a **9900X** (12C, nearly highest 1T clocks) vs a **7600X** (6C, slowest 1T clocks) and then claim (3:45): \"*Let's be honest, this kind of performance uplift in a single generation is huge*.\" Mate, you are not comparing a single generation leap. We also jumped like 5+ CPUs up in the product stack. The appropriate comparison does (or rather will) exist: the X2E 78 exists, another 12C, low-tier SKU. We saw the same with the X9 388H (PTL) being compared to then mid-tier CPUs. // Laptop reviewers seem notorious for no clocks / cores on each CPU in the charts: it'd be beneficial, with the alphabet soup AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm use, for more clarity what SKU is what. On desktop, we can match by price. ***If*** the X2E 88 *is* found in all the cheaper laptops that housed the X1E 78, it makes more sense. But until then, just match the SKUs or provide that context for users. // Also, it seems like this has slower perf / GHz 1T on CB2024? Some quick maths: X1E 78 (108 pts / 3.4 GHz): 31.8 Pts / GHz X2E 88 (146 pts / 4.7 GHz): 31.0 Pts / GHz I would for more optimizations, but ASUS specifically said the Cinebench numbers were in line, so it is weird. However, it *may* be like Geekerwan's 8EG5 results, where the CPU actually notably throttles at 1T boost, so it can't hold the 4.7 GHz clock (thus dividing by 4.7 GHz is not accurate).",

The feel is completely different. First off, it\u2019s lighter and the build quality just screams premium. It also feels slightly smaller than the original. But the real game-changer was playing Mario Kart World with it. The HD rumble is on another level\u2014way more detailed, like the new Joy-Con. And the sticks\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to describe it, but they\u2019re so smooth. Buttons feel better too, almost silent and more comfortable. Overall, if you\u2019re on the fence about getting one, I\u2019d say this is easily one of the best controllers out there right now. The lack of analog triggers is a bummer\u2014especially with rumors about Forza Horizon 5 maybe coming to Switch 2\u2014but honestly, it\u2019s not a dealbreaker. TL;DR: Switch Pro 2 controller = lightweight, premium, smoother sticks, improved rumble. No analog triggers, but still highly recommended.",

And on the one hand, yeah, that's not incorrect. But on the other hand, we had no real idea when any of them were coming, which - for me at least - makes it a bit hard to get excited for them. Like, when Elden Ring was announced way way back at the Switch 2 reveal, yeah, that was a cool announcement. Yet the reality is that here we are in early 2026 not only with no Elden Ring but no idea when it might appear after it missed its initial 2025 window. We now know the same will not be happening (or at least is massively unlikely to happen) with the games mentioned above - and that's surely a huge positive. With Fallout 4 and Indiana Jones having been initially given just '2026' as a release year, that's already a long ass time to cover and, as seen with Elden Ring (and Final Fantasy VII Remake actually) it's always very possible to see games slip into the following year. Instead, we now know these 'big' games are coming and coming very soon. We will actually be playing them instead of just wondering about them. For me, the thing I most want from any Direct is to fill up my upcoming wishlist, and that's exactly what this Partner Direct has done. The first half of this year now has more than enough games to keep me very occupied and that's really all I care about.",

I'm a fan of most of Nintendo's first-party series (basically everything but Smash and Metroid) and adore RPGs of any kind, so the first half of this year is draining my fun budget (and free time!) to the dregs. FF VII Remake in January, DQ VII Reimagined in February, Pokopia and MH Stories 3 in March, Tomodachi Life in April, FF VII Rebirth in June, Digimon Time Stranger in July, and likely Yoshi and the Mysterious Book and Fire Emblem Fates' Weave releasing at some point within the April-July window, as well. I literally will not be able to buy all these games on day one *because I don't have enough time to play them* since I'm an adult with a full-time job, a house to look after and a semblance of a social life to maintain. I'm pretty sure that those complaining that there are no new or exciting games to play on the console either are only fans of a couple of very specific Nintendo IPs or have another platform that they have already played every recent third-party game on.",

Also all of the screenshots are from the Japanese version. Here\u2019s a rundown of all the major information with the important stuff in bold: \u2022Chapter 5 begins extremely similarly to Chapter 1 \u2022**The Voice** talks to the player yet again \u2022**The beginning of Chapter 5 is the Festival** \u2022Half-way through the festival we enter the Dark World which is, indeed, via **Flower King** \u2022Chapter 5 opens up with Kris & Susie in a large field, with a giant silhouette in front of a pink & gold sky (seems to be either Asgore or a Titan?) \u2022Kris & Susie are trying to find Ralsei while enemies attack from the bushes \u2022New enemies include *Magimagikun,* an unnamed blue species with red armor, and some shadowy cat-like creatures \\*\u2022\\*Ralsei is kidnapped by a group of NPC\u2019s lead by a, *\u201ctall lady,\u201d* who is apparently named **Estoc** according to a shopkeep \u2022Something happens were Estoc invites the Fun Gang to join her in the **Royal Garden** \u2022Something happens that makes **The Soul leave Kris**, which results in a chase scene. Kris chases the soul while throwing objects at it \u2022After escaping the garden, a hall of roses would appear, with shadows of **cats** coming from them. These cats try to attack the Fun Gang will bullets via a giant Paw \u2022Kris & Susie are benched for a segment of the chapter (something happens were they get super sleepy), and **you take control of Ralsei**\u2026sort of. \u2022**The Soul once again escapes from Kris and leads Ralsei via shining their light.** \u2022**Ralsei is seemingly getting the Secret Boss this chapter** (akin to Spamton & Kris and Gerson & Susie) \u2022No information on the Weird Route \u2022**You can only fight Estoc with Ralsei** \u2022Estoc turns the Soul **Purple** akin to Undertale\u2019s Muffet \u2022Ralsei will get a **new weapon** at the end of the Secret Route \u2022**The Heroes of TV Time** reappear for the Chapter\u2019s **Egg Route** \u2022Chapter 5\u2019s Flower King Dark World is a giant Castle with fields of flowers and a noticeable amount of cherry blossoms \u2022**The Roaring Knight** appears at the very end of the Chapter \u2022Asgore, *\u201cdoes something,\u201d* to Estoc \u2022No mention of **Sans** in the Chapter so far \u2022No word on if the **Six Flowers** will appear, although the **Blue Flower** has a role in the **Egg Route** \u2022Estoc\u2019s Lightner form has something to do with **pens & paper** \u2022Chapter 5 **WILL** expand on I**mage\\_Friend** \\*\\*\u2022Queen will be fighting with the Fun Gang in the Party Dojo (\\*\\*the screenshot noticeably shows her against Tenna) \u2022Egg Mission involves backtracking through the castle and back into Flower King, and something about a wheat field and the Heroes of TV Time \u2022Ralsei\u2019s **HP** apparently grows **twice towards the end of the Chapter** *To be updated if there is any more information\u2026*",

The mainstream media keeps hoping buyers are still living under a rock, while simultaneously pumping sellers with hopeium drugs, as if home prices aren't declining everywhere outside the Northeast ....and even then, the actual sales are slowing down. Which means that if they can't sell the house, they're stuck with that house for life, along with all of its carrying costs. * Housing affordability has deteriorated sharply since 2019, with mortgage payments now consuming over 30% of median household income. * Restoring 2019 affordability would require either a 56% jump in median income or mortgage rates falling back to \\~2.65%, neither of which is realistic. * Even if rates fall, home prices are expected to keep rising because demand will rebound faster than supply. * The core issue is a 4\u2011million\u2011home national shortage, driven by zoning limits and slow permitting. * Regional timelines vary dramatically: the South could close its housing gap in \\~3 years, while the Northeast is projected not to close it at all under current trends.",

Five leading public AI companies are collectively on track to spend about **$700B** this year on large-scale projects, primarily data centers filled with powerful computer chips. This level of spending is **nearly double** what they spent in 2025 and is comparable to roughly three-quarters of the annual U.S. military budget. This type of investment is contributing to shortages of skilled labor such as electricians, rising construction costs & tighter supplies of computer chips. **Industry analysts** said this has already pushed up prices for memory chips used in smartphones and computers, with higher consumer electronics prices expected to follow. The data center construction boom is also drawing workers and resources away from other types of building projects, while smaller technology firms face declining **access** to funding as investment becomes increasingly concentrated among a small number of large AI companies. **Source:** The Washington Post (Exclusive)",

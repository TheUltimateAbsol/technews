Just a month before that happened, someone [made a post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/17ad683/gta_vi_plot_mechanics/) claiming to know plot details. It has a pretty good chance of being real, considering that the post includes the earliest mention of Jason picking up Lucia from prison. >**Plot** >I was surprised by my source when I was told that Lucia has a baby that she abandons at a delicatessen before heading out to a bank robbery and then getting arrested for doing such an act. It is not known if the baby was a boy or a girl and obviously, there will be no kids in the game, this only happens in a cutscene as a flashback of the past, I have no information about what happens to this baby after this point. >After a few years, Lucia gets released on probation, **she\u2019s picked up at the prison by Jason** who\u2019s planning a robbery with her, and they\u2019ll fall in love with each other after some time. >The majority of the planning for the missions takes place at a nightclub called \u201cVault\u201d. >In the very first mission of the game you control Jason and you have to follow a plane that is about to land and carries a Russian drug dealer. Apparently, Jason meets this guy and starts to plan a mission to steal drugs. In this drug stealing mission, they are chased by the police and the drug ends up falling into the ocean. There is a following mission where they will have to dive to retrieve it. >**Mechanics** >There is a new mechanic for detecting threats and valuable items around you, this is not a special ability like Franklin\u2019s ability to drive cars with a special handing, this is a new mechanic that seems to be somewhat inspired by the dead eye targeting from RDR2, this mechanic is revealed in the Hanks\u2019 Waffles dining robbery, present in the leaked videos. >Rockstar has also been focusing on very detailed mechanics of searching places, this one seems to be also inspired by a mechanic from RDR2. >That\u2019s all I can reveal for now guys.

It all started with a high-profile report from Noble Securities analysts, who are forecasting the release of a massive, paid expansion for *The Witcher 3* or a standalone project on a scale similar to Sony\u2019s *Spider-Man* spin-off, *Miles Morales*. This project would reportedly serve as a narrative bridge between the third game and the upcoming new saga, while also allowing CD Projekt RED to hit key targets in their corporate incentive program. # Potential Details for the Third Witcher 3 DLC Crucially, IGN Poland has confirmed that whispers of such an expansion have been circulating behind the scenes for years, though they were kept strictly confidential until now. We at PPE can also verify these revelations - our own sources tipped us off about a new *Wild Hunt* project a year ago. In the first half of 2025, we were explicitly told that *The Witcher 3* would receive massive new content that fans \"will absolutely love.\" As of today, CD Projekt RED has not officially commented on these reports, but notably, they have not denied them either. According to information disclosed by IGN (details we hadn't personally heard, suggesting the project may have evolved over the years), developers might have planned a journey in an entirely new, exotic direction long ago. While many players are looking toward the frozen North, the studio\u2019s original plans allegedly pointed toward Zerrikania. After the mud of Velen and the fairytale atmosphere of Toussaint, a sandy desert with a scorching sun and a distinct culture would be a massive breath of fresh air - effectively a \"Witcher in a *Dune*\\-like setting.\" The Zerrikania theory gains weight when examining clues hidden within the game and supplemental materials. One of the strongest arguments involves the Manticore School, the diagrams for which Geralt discovers in the *Blood and Wine* expansion. The school\u2019s headquarters are located in the East, on the edge of the desert. Interestingly, lore for \"The Witcher TTRPG\" mentions that this school was the only one to experiment with the Trial of the Grasses on women. This opens a fascinating narrative door for Ciri - an expedition to Zerrikania could be her chance to undergo mutations safely, which would explain her appearance in the teaser for the new saga. Further \"seed-planting\" for this direction can be found in Letho of Gulet\u2019s dialogue. If the Kingslayer survived in your save file, he explicitly declares his intent to leave for Zerrikania, seeking peace in its matriarchy, far from the political quagmire of the North. We also shouldn't forget the upcoming Witcher 1 Remake. The main antagonist, Azar Javed, hailed from Zerrikania. Returning to his homeland in a new DLC would be a brilliant marketing move, tying together CD Projekt RED\u2019s legacy and future titles ahead of both *The Witcher 4* and the od-school remake. # What About Kovir and Poviss? The alternative to desert sands remains the freezing Kovir and Poviss, often called the \"Venice of the North.\" The vision of snow-covered palaces, canals, and the Northern Lights on an upgraded engine sounds like a graphical masterpiece. It would be the perfect setting for a political thriller in a land of spies and extreme wealth. However, this direction seems risky from a marketing perspective. Since *The Witcher 4* is expected to take us to frigid regions, releasing a snowy expansion for *The Witcher 3* right before the new saga could rob the sequel of its freshness and spoil the \"wow factor\" of the new location. There is also a hard technical reality weighing against Kovir. Building the complex architecture of cities like Pont Vanis from scratch on the old REDengine, only to have to recreate the same thing in Unreal Engine 5 for the new saga, seems like a waste of resources. Consequently, Zerrikania appears to be a much safer and more interesting testing ground that could offer players something never before seen in the *Witcher* world - epic encounters with massive beasts that are worshipped in that region. Regardless of whether we end up donning furs in Kovir or fighting under the desert sun, 2026 is shaping up to be a massive celebration for fans of Geralt and CD Projekt RED. Based on recent reports, the studio must release something significant in the coming months to meet its financial obligations. The fact that so many independent sources - from analysts to IGN to our own findings here at PPE - confirm that something new is in the works makes it almost certain that CDPR is preparing a return we didn't see coming. A sales target of 11 million units requires boldness, and an expedition to the exotic Zerrikania would certainly qualify as a bold move.",

Unlike most humanoid robots focused on demonstrations or lab settings, Atlas is being built for **practical deployment**, including factory work and hazardous tasks where human labor is limited or risky. Hyundai has confirmed that Atlas is **factory-ready**, with phased deployment planned at Hyundai manufacturing plants starting in **2028**, signaling a shift from experimental humanoids to commercially usable systems. **Source: Interesting Engineering** \ud83d\udd17: https://interestingengineering.com/ai-robotics/hyundais-atlas-humanoid-wins-top-honor",

This High-NA EUV tool maintains the high resolution of the first-generation EXE:5000, while expanding output to *175 wafers per hour* and improving overlay (accurate alignment of different lithography layers) to 0.7 nanometers. > This builds on Intel\u2019s experience with High-NA EUV that began in 2023 with the shipment of the world\u2019s first commercial High-NA tool to our research and development fab in Oregon. > Key enabling innovations of the EXE:5200B include the following: > * Higher power EUV source: Faster wafer exposure at practical doses, supporting resist/process windows for high contrast patterning while minimizing Line Edge Roughness and Line Width Roughness. > * New wafer stocker architecture: Improved lot logistics and thermal/process stability, which mitigate drift and enhance throughput consistency, especially critical for multipass or multiexposure flows. > * Tighter alignment control: The 0.7 nm overlay figure reflects advances in stage control, sensor calibration, and environmental isolation, all of which matter as customers push the limits of transistor density. > #### 2D Materials for Future Transistor Scaling > [\u2026] > In joint work presented at IEDM last week, Imec and Intel demonstrated a 300mm manufacturable integration of source/drain contacts and gate stack modules for 2DFETs (WS\u2082, MoS\u2082 for ntype; WSe\u2082 for ptype). The central innovation is a selective oxide etch applied to Intel-grown, high-quality 2D layers that were capped with AlOx/HfO\u2082/SiO\u2082. This enabled damascene-style top contacts, a reference to the ancient technique of embedding metal into a trench or groove.

Let's hope he is wrong. >I doubt that anything resembling genuine \"artificial general intelligence\" is within reach of current #AI tools. However, I think a weaker, but still quite valuable, type of \"artificial general cleverness\" is becoming a reality in various ways. >By \"general cleverness\", I mean the ability to solve broad classes of complex problems via somewhat ad hoc means. These means may be stochastic or the result of brute force computation; they may be ungrounded or fallible; and they may be either uninterpretable, or traceable back to similar tricks found in an AI's training data. So they would not qualify as the result of any true \"intelligence\". And yet, they can have a non-trivial success rate at achieving an increasingly wide spectrum of tasks, particularly when coupled with stringent verification procedures to filter out incorrect or unpromising approaches, at scales beyond what individual humans could achieve. >This results in the somewhat unintuitive combination of a technology that can be very useful and impressive, while simultaneously being fundamentally unsatisfying and disappointing - somewhat akin to how one's awe at an amazingly clever magic trick can dissipate (or transform to technical respect) once one learns how the trick was performed. >But perhaps this can be resolved by the realization that while cleverness and intelligence are somewhat correlated traits for humans, they are much more decoupled for AI tools (which are often optimized for cleverness), and viewing the current generation of such tools primarily as a stochastic generator of sometimes clever - and often useful - thoughts and outputs may be a more productive perspective when trying to use them to solve difficult problems.",

Perhaps a fair point, but I'll note that when he says this cleverness may be \"traceable back to similar tricks found in an AI's training data\", I have to notice the similarities to how humans learn to do mental \"tricks\" or \"rules of thumb\" that allow them to solve problems by saving time or energy (sometimes called heuristics), which they learn from their own \"training data\" or lived experience.",

Here are prompts, since most of them aren't properly visible : 1. \"A futuristic robot shaking hands with a human businessman. The robot is on the left side of the frame. The background is a blurred office.\" 2. \"A first-person point-of-view shot looking down at your own feet. You are wearing mismatched sneakers (left foot red, right foot blue) and standing on a skateboard.\" 3. \"A black cat hiding behind a sheer white curtain. Only the cat's silhouette and glowing yellow eyes are visible through the fabric textures.\" 4. \"A red apple on the far left, a blue hardcover book in the center, and a green ceramic vase on the right. The book is leaning diagonally against the vase.\" 5. \"A transparent glass sphere contained inside a wireframe metal cube, which is balanced delicately on the tip of a stone pyramid. The pyramid is floating above a calm, mirror-like ocean.\" 6. \"A person eating spaghetti, sucking a noodle into their mouth. The noodle connects from the plate to the lips.\" 7. \"A group of 5 diverse friends taking a selfie. All faces are in focus, distinct, and high quality.\" 8. \"A close-up of a musician's hands playing a complex chord on an acoustic guitar. Fingers are pressing specific strings.\" 9. \"A delicious pepperoni pizza with absolutely no basil leaves.\" 10. \"A teddy bear made of shiny, reflective chrome metal, sitting on a concrete floor.\" 11. \"A hybrid animal that is half-owl and half-cat. The head is an owl, the body is a cat. It is perched on a branch.\" 12. \"A classic wooden chair that is carved entirely out of translucent green Jell-O. It is wobbling slightly.\" 13. \"A yellow strawberry and a blue lemon sitting side-by-side on a silver plate.\" 14. \"A clean, vector-style infographic illustration of a bicycle with labels pointing to parts: 'Wheel', 'Seat', 'Pedal', 'Handlebar'.\" 15. \"The word 'NATURE' formed by the negative space between towering pine trees in a dense, foggy forest.\" 16. \"A latte art pattern in a white ceramic cup that clearly spells out the word 'Love' in the milk foam.\" 17. \"Extreme close-up of a denim jacket collar. The word 'REBELLION' is embroidered in gold thread. The stitching texture is visible and follows the folds of the fabric.\" 18. \"A neon sign mounted on a textured brick wall that explicitly reads: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'. The sign is glowing pink.\"",

People have already abandoned the \"as good as the average human\" threshold without acknowledging it, but this is so close to superhuman. It's also curious to me that only GPT 5 does this and we hear it almost on a daily basis. Not Gemini 3, not Claude 4.5. There doesnt seem to be this discrepancy between benchmark results and real world use with GPT 5 unlike the competitors.",

        "score": 390,
        "text_content": "A new interview just dropped on the **Google DeepMind channel** and it is packed with specific details on their roadmap, timelines and philosophy. While **others** are betting 100% on scaling laws, Demis reveals DeepMind is playing a **different game.** **1. The \"10x\" Scale & Speed:** He explicitly compares the coming AGI shift to the Industrial Revolution but with a terrifying/exciting multiplier. *\"It's going to be 10x bigger and maybe 10x faster.\"* He suggests this transformation will **happen in a decade rather than a century.** **2. The \"50/50\" Secret Sauce:** This is a huge strategic reveal. DeepMind isn't just throwing compute at the wall. **The Split:** They allocate 50% of effort to Scaling and 50% to Innovation (Architecture/Research). **The \"Wall\":** He implies that scaling alone isn't enough to reach AGI, you need fundamental architectural breakthroughs to fix **\"Jagged Intelligence\"** (where models are PhD-level at physics but fail basic logic). **3. Solving \"Root Node\" Problems(Post-Scarcity):** Demis doubles down on using AI for science first. He calls Fusion and Superconductors (Materials) **\"Root Node\"** problems. **The Thesis:** If AI solves energy (Fusion) and efficiency (Materials), you unlock everything else (Water, Food, Transport). **The Quote:** He explicitly questions **\"what happens to money\"** in a world where energy and goods are abundant/free. **4. Simulation Theory (Genie + SIMA):** He teases a future training pipeline: Using **Genie** (World Model) to generate infinite 3D worlds. Plugging **SIMA (Agent)** into those worlds to learn physics and logic via evolution, without needing real-world robot data. **With the \"50% Innovation\" comment, does this confirm that Google believes the \"Scaling Law Wall\" is real? Or is this just how they differentiate from OpenAI?** **Source: Google DeepMind - The Future of Intelligence** \ud83d\udd17: https://youtu.be/PqVbypvxDto?si=0bgv1OnfxBtVgYeP",

Nearly free energy + extremely cheaply extracted and processed materials unlocks everything else, and we have housing/transportation almost free. They\u2019re assuming AI will be able to design & build a working fusion reactor and robots come out ready to get to work. Another big assumption is energy companies, construction companies, food distribution companies- all will be willing to walk away from hegemony without a decades-long political battle they paid for.",

However, while scaling may continue to take AI models further, it is only in a linear way, whereas the other 50% innovation element will open up multiple new routes that can spread AI in all directions, enabling it to be properly balanced and well-rounded.",

A computer alogrithm distributes the amounts across thousands of real names of people who have not actually donated. Voter Registration Databases: Inactive names are switched on and then off in real time. The databases are dynamic (not static). Ballots are often sent to real names at wrong addresses before being switched back to the correct address. Electronic Poll Books: Connected to the internet, a fake entry will show up and be marked as having voted even though no actual person went to the polling place to vote. Voting System Tabulator: In compliance with Disability laws, tabulators are loaded with ink to mark ballots. Ovals may be filled in using different 'font settings' to make the circles look as if they were filled in by a human. All systems are connected to the internet and results are moved towards a preset number via an algorithm. (e.g. batches all reporting results such as 50.1%/49.9% over and over and over). We started this in other countries first in order to do regime change. Then we psyop-ed the 2000 election to villainize hanging chads so we could 'help' states with new electronic voting equipment.",

On average the Framework Desktop over this entire span of CPU benchmarks saw an average wall power reading of 133 Watts with a recorded peak of 227 Watts. The Dell Pro Max GB10 meanwhile had a 103 Watt average with a recorded 164 Watt peak for all of these benchmarks. So while the Framework Desktop performance geo mean was at 1.285x, the total system power consumption was 1.29x higher on average and the peak was 1.38x. If you are investing in the Dell Pro Max GB10 or any other GB10 platform, chances are though you are running AI workloads and other software fully engaging both the CPU and GPU. The Blackwell GPU with the GB10 offers a lot more compute potential over the Radeon 8060S graphics but similarly the Dell Pro Max GB10 pricing is around $4139 USD as of writing and the Framework Desktop around $2928 USD if going for the same RAM and storage capacity.

I find it to be amazing in Lords of the Fallen, but don't see any real difference in Doom Eternal compared to K except lower FPS. You can't just set M globally and expect to get a better experience across the board, you have to compare it to other presets in each game and reach your own conclusions.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, a Commerce Department measure the central bank uses as its main forecasting tool, showed inflation at 2.8% for the month both for headline and core, in line with the Dow Jones consensus. In addition, the department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the rate for October was 2.7% on both a headline and core basis, the latter excluding volatile food and energy prices. The monthly figures showed a 0.2% increase for both months. The BEA released the October and November numbers together due to impacts from the government shutdown during which official agencies suspended data collection and reports. In addition to the inflation figures, the report showed personal income up 0.1% in October and 0.3% in November, the latter 0.1 percentage point below the forecast. Also, personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer spending, rose 0.5% in both months, matching the November forecast. The personal savings rate rose in November to 3.5%, down 0.2 percentage point from the prior month. Price figures for November reflected 0.2% increases in both goods and services. Food was flat while energy-related costs rose 1.9% and after falling 0.7% in October. The report comes the same day that the BEA said gross domestic product rose 4.4% in the third quarter, according to the second and final estimate. In addition, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims are trending around their lowest level in two years. Together, the data indicates an economy continuing to expand, with consumer spending ahead of inflation despite a somewhat softening labor market. \u201cThe consumer continues to drive the U.S economy, with today\u2019s data pointing to another strong gain in spending. This resilience comes in spite of last year\u2019s slowdown in the labor market, and still elevated inflation, both of which have weighed on real incomes,\u201d said James McCann, senior economist for investment strategy at Edward Jones. \u201cToday\u2019s data should reassure the Fed that the economy remains on a solid footing, despite a cooler labor market.\u201d Markets expect the Federal Reserve to stay on hold at its policy meeting next week following three consecutive interest rate cuts in 2025. Futures traders see at most two rate reductions this year as policymakers weigh the impact of last year\u2019s easing, coupled with continued inflation pressures and an uncertain geopolitical landscape.",

U.S. pending home sales fell 2.9% year over year during the four weeks ending January 18, the smallest decline in over a month, as mortgage rates declined. Mortgage-purchase applications rose 5% week over week to their highest level in three years. New listings followed a similar pattern as pending sales: They dipped 1.6% year over year, the smallest decline since November. The slight improvements in homebuying demand and home listings are largely the result of falling mortgage rates. The weekly average mortgage rate dropped to a three-year low of 6.06% last week after President Trump ordered $200 billion in mortgage bond purchases. Lower mortgage rates have brought the median U.S. monthly housing payment down to $2,441, a 6.3% decline from this time last year. (The daily average rate has increased from a 3-year low of about 6% in early January to 6.2% this week.) Even though homebuying and selling activity improved, the homes that are selling are taking a long time to find buyers. The typical home that sold spent 61 days on the market before going under contract, a week longer than last year. That\u2019s largely because it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market, with home sellers outnumbering buyers by a record margin; many buyers are taking their time with both house hunting and negotiations. \u201cBuyers have much more power than they\u2019ve had over the past few years,\u201d said Ben Ambroch, a Redfin Premier agent in Milwaukee. \u201cA lot of buyers are giving up a 3% mortgage rate for a 6% rate, so they have high standards for their new home. Buyers are negotiating prices and asking for repairs based on inspections. Sellers are more willing to compromise because listings have been sitting on the market longer; the sellers who need to move are eager to get a deal done.\u201d",

        "score": 113,
        "text_content": "Source: https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-lowers-profit-margin-projection-revenue-skyrockets According to reporting from The Information, Anthropic projected roughly $9 billion in annualized revenue for 2025, while expecting about -$5.2 billion in cash burn. That burn is significant relative to revenue, and the situation was made worse by the fact that Anthropic acknowledged its inference costs (Google and Amazon servers) were 23% higher than the company expected, which materially compressed margins and pushed expenses above plan. For a company with a comparatively limited user base, those cost overruns matter a lot. OpenAI, by contrast, exited 2025 at roughly $20 billion in annualized revenue, but likely realized closer to $12 to $13 billion in actual revenue during the year, while having a reported -$8.5 billion in cash burn, way under original estimates. That implies total expenses in the low $20 billions, which still results in losses, but at a completely different scale. Importantly, OpenAI is supporting roughly 900 million weekly active users, orders of magnitude more usage than Anthropic, and has far more avenues to monetize that base over time, including enterprise contracts, API growth, and upcoming advertising. The key takeaway from the article is that both companies are effectively burning at a similar absolute rate, once you strip away the headlines and normalize for timing and scale. The difference is not the size of the losses, but the paths to monetization. Anthropic is almost entirely dependent on enterprise revenue, and higher-than-expected TPU costs directly cut into that model. OpenAI, meanwhile, is operating at vastly greater scale, with hundreds of millions of weekly users and multiple monetization levers. Sam Altman said today that OpenAI added $1 billion of enterprise annualized revenue in just the last 30 days, on top of consumer subscriptions, API usage, and upcoming advertising. That breadth of demand materially changes how its burn should be interpreted. Curious how others here view this tradeoff between burn rate, scale, and long-term monetization optionality of these two companies?",

We'll see if this 3x trend continues or if it starts to decline *like OpenAI expects* (I'm sure that if their growth *does* decline, people will start pointing at OpenAI \"losing\" as it's all the rage nowadays even though they project slower growth in the first place).",

Did the model get a worldview for how lighting works? This seems like emergent behavior. And this image came out late 2024, and the model did too. But this was the oldest model I have access to. Wild that optical illusions might work on AI models too.",

It was during that period that I think I really leaned into just how dependent people have become on these bots for pandering, companionship and ass-kissing. There were posts of people who LITERALLY said things like \"This just isn't fair. How do I get it to agree with everything I say again?\" - with torrents of people responding, either commiserating, or advising on how to get it to be ass-kissing again - not people voicing concern. I would literally have to scroll down just to find a comment that said something to the effect of \"Why do you want something to agree with everything you say? Don't you value accuracy?\". I don't mean to sound cynical, but I don't have much faith in the average human being critically-thinking, introspective and able to navigate their shame and emotional wounds. So it seems to align with that to see the vast amount of people that want a \"yes\"-bot that celebrates their every whim.",

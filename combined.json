He says this worked because Trump deferred to Elon Musk to handle things. Now Mike Benz says the cabinet has regained much of the power and it\u2019s back to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. \u201cWhat happened with DOGE and why can't we sustain the pace? And is there any hope of getting back to a fast pace?\u201d Mike Benz \u201cWhat I know from my contacts in the admin, I was told by multiple people at multiple different agencies that DOGE was a complete game changer because whereas agencies were previously ruled by careers I was talking about this, for example, with the FBI. We have four political appointees at the FBI. There's 38,000 FBI employees. So it's 4 versus 38,000. The great equalizer in the first couple of months of the admin was that DOGE were in the building and they directly had the deputized power of the Office of Management and Budget effectively to just cut the budgets of anybody in the career class, shut down any department, freeze the funding. If you were a career and you were trying to be insubordinate against the politicals, doge could come in and make the careers have to respect the politicals because if they didn't do what they were told in the chain of command, you'd get doged. That was a game changer. My contacts at state and DHS and in the early USAID were all telling me, oh my God, the agency for the first time seems to be working how it's supposed to be working because the careers are doing what the political appointees told them to do. Not because they fear the political appointees, they fear DOGE. But I think that what was imbued in DOGE was the kind of silent power of Elon Musk and the fact that Trump, I think, before the cabinet was fully filled out, kind of deferred to Elon on most things that Trump didn't care too much about in terms of beer crack management. But I think with that power going away in DOGE no longer representing the full force of Elon Musk, it began to loop moves to the cabinet level consensus, which is a lot more business as usual.\u201d https://x.com/WallStreetApes/status/1994610551507578937?s=20",

This was back when the application was on paper, and \"motor voter\" was still opt-in -- not opt-out, as it is now, where you have to check a box if a you *don't* want to register to vote. She was very surprised when she received her voter registration card in the mail a short time later, and a bit scared because she was afraid she might be accused of deliberately registering even though as a noncitizen she was ineligible. The DMV workers were apparently \"helping\" people who \"forgot\" to the check box. Now it's all on a computer screen, and I'm sure a lot of porrly educated noncitizens with shaky are confused and think maybe they're not supposed to check the opt-out box because it has something to do with voting.

        "text_content": "### Office verdict: **8.9** The ASUS ProArt Display PA32QCV is excellent for office use. It has a high 6k resolution that helps result in sharp text, but its aggressive matte coating causes text to look hazy. It also has a big 32-inch screen that helps with multitasking with various windows next to each other. Thanks to its high screen brightness and superb reflection handling, which helps minimize glare, it's even a great choice to use in a well-lit office space. Lastly, it comes with productivity features, including Thunderbolt support with daisy chaining, a KVM switch, and an ergonomic stand that's easy to adjust. **Pros** * High pixel density for sharp text and detailed images. * Large 32-inch screen. * Gets bright and reduces glare easily. * USB hub includes Thunderbolt 4 and a KVM switch. * Supports daisy chaining. **Cons** * Aggressive matte coating causes haze. ### Editing verdict: **8.0** The ASUS ProArt Display PA32QCV is great for editing. Its 32-inch screen helps if you need to multitask with various windows open, and its high 6k resolution makes images look detailed, and text looks sharp. It comes with picture modes for various color spaces that you may work with, including an sRGB mode, which you need to calibrate for a perfectly accurate image because it has a cold color temperature. It's a bad choice for editing content in HDR, though, as it has a low contrast ratio and its local dimming feature fails to improve the black levels. On the plus side, its Thunderbolt support is great if you want to connect a Thunderbolt laptop, like a MacBook, and it has a few features to help with productivity, like daisy chaining and a KVM switch. **Pros** * High pixel density for sharp text and detailed images. * Large 32-inch screen. * Gets bright and reduces glare easily. * USB hub includes Thunderbolt 4 and a KVM switch. * Supports daisy chaining. * Accurate sRGB mode. **Cons** * Blacks look gray due to low contrast. * Highlights don't pop in HDR. * Cold color temperature out of the box. * Aggressive matte coating causes haze.",

In what way is it not game over if we throw up our hands over this problem and say housing will simply never be affordable again? It's not about wealth accumulation for most people in younger generations. People know they need to break away from the pack to have any chance of affording things that are *meaningful* to them. If the only way to afford to own one's own house, have children, etc. is to make significantly more than median income, one has to take risks beyond the median. Propping up housing costs at the expense of the young is the real financial nihilism.",

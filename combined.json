            {
                "raw_content": "The whole discussion surrounding DLSS4/4.5 and it's presets depend on your HW. There are a lot of permutations to account for depending on the kind of experience you want, perf vs visual quality. Testing done was all done on a 3070. Preset L has minor uplifts when comparing to preset M at the same scaling factor of performance (4x) mostly seen in vegetation/trees and trades it with a minor performance hit compared to M. With the same scaling factor we see that preset K has more performance than preset L. 'Ultra performance' a scaling factor of 9x offsets this costs and is why it is recommended by Nvidia. If we compare 'ultra performance' preset L to 'performance' preset K, L yields better performance in FPS. What is interesting from Alex's findings is that there seems to be a problem with preset M and L with a game's internal denoiser. In the past Alex noted that preset K can handle noise in RT reflections better than M, being more stable. If you disabled a game's denoiser it is a night and day difference to the visual quality. I do wish Alex did a side by side with preset L 'ultra performance' with preset K 'performance'. As he noted, offsetting the cost of preset L with a lower input resolution can beat out in FPS with preset K in performance. What you miss out on preset L 'ultra performance' vs 'performance' is simply the level of detail retrieval due to the lower input res, but you still gain the level of stability from preset M and L's strengths. Oh and as for 1440p, well don't even think about 'ultra performance' give 'performance' a go depending how you value visual quality and performance uplift.",

The majority of gamers are perfectly happy with poor graphical and image quality \u2014 as long as you don't tell them about it. So many people can't tell the difference between RT on and off, used fsr 2, got tricked by 'lossless' scaling's name and thought it was better than DLSS, or glazed KCD2's performance, happy to play at medium settings as long as they got to press the button that said ultra. Anyway, I think the most interesting part of the video is that base DLSS is a actually a great denoiser. If devs don't/can't add ray reconstruction, maybe they could just have a setting to disable denoising when upscaling is used.",

While this was a modest quarterly increase, the broader picture continues to reflect significant affordability challenges. With mortgage interest rates remaining elevated, and housing supply still tight, housing affordability is at a multidecade low. Compared to the peak of 69.2% in 2004, the homeownership rate is currently 3.5 percentage points lower and remains below the 25-year average rate of 66.3%. It is also important to note that the fourth quarter\u2019s data comes with a higher level of uncertainty. Due to the government shutdown, the Census only collected data for the last two months of 2025. **Compared to the previous year, homeownership rates increased in only two age groups. Among younger households, the homeownership rate for those under 35 increased 1.6 percentage points to 37.9% in the last quarter of 2025. This age group is particularly sensitive to mortgage rates and the inventory of entry-level homes.** Homeownership rates for householders ages 55-64 inched up by 0.4 percentage points over the same time. In contrast, several middle-aged and older groups saw declines. Householders ages 45-54 experienced the largest drop, declining 1.5 percentage points from 71.0% to 69.5%. The 35-44 age group saw a 0.5 percentage point decrease, decreasing from 61.4% to 60.9%. Homeownership rates for householders aged 65 years and over declined 0.5 percentage points from a year ago. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RHORUSQ156N",

When ChatGPT was available for the public, I already found it crazy to have something that basically could answer you as you were talking to it in a normal way. It wasn't connected to Internet but at that time I though it was too complicated and maybe that it would need 5,6 more years of development. Several months later, you could browse the Internet with ChatGPT. It was incredible. Same thing for DALL E back in the day. The pictures were pretty sketchy but you could just generate images from the void just by prompting them. And now we have image to video or video live AI 90/95% realistic?? And during all this time, people were telling me \"bro ChatGPT makes errors, look\" or \"yeah but the pictures are too sketchy, it can't be used\". They would over focus on details while avoiding the big picture... And now we have agents?? AI is really a revolution and I swear I'm not a bot lol (kind of thing an AI would say but yk)",

At the same time I have a skeptical colleague that is also level-headed and makes predictions that makes them accountable every year or so, and so far their predictions have been the most accurate of all the ones I follow closely. They are correct by about 70% I'd say, but the remaining 30% are underestimating AI progress. Often, the more optimistic ones have outlandish predictions and a smaller portions of them turn out true, and they are typically in the area where this skeptical colleague is incorrect.",

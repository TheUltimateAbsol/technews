Compared to the older Arc 140T, the Arc B390M is nearly 80% faster in certain titles. In Baldur's Gate 3, the iGPU delivers virtually the same performance as the dedicated Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU, but in Cyberpunk 2077 the Nvidia graphics card is 20% faster.

DLSS4.0-4.5 feels like a far messier transition than DLSS3-4.0, there's highly variable frametime cost depending on not just input/output res but GPU architecture as well, the per-game image quality improvements/regressions compared to DLSS4.0 seem wildly inconsistent, there's that odd pseudo-oversharpening artifact especially noticeable at 1080p, it's all rather unintuitive now compared to the rather simple duality of DLSS3CNN vs DLSS4-T.

About Age of empires and XBOX's efforts on Real time strategy Games. i don't know a great deal but i will say this \" i think it's being developed on Unreal Engine because one of the big issues they had with Age Of Empires 4, from what i heard, was Relic's Engine and this engine and development pipeline was very difficult for them to work with and to adapt to the Age of empires, what people expect from Age of Empires. So they (World's Edge) are moving to something more proprietary built on Unreal Engine though. Something more custom and things like that. i don't know who's building it but at least the bones are being made by World's Edge Studios. I would presume they're going to partner with another developer on it\". Again \"\"Age of Empires remains one of Microsoft's most prolifics IPs and they've really cornered that niche, the whikw real tielme Strategy that it doesn't have the same popularity that it did back in the day. But as Xbox moves deeper into PC gaming i do think like Age of Empires and games like it are definitely going to be a Major part of their purview. And another thing i'll say by the ways, is that they are interested in also bringing StarCraft back as an RTS altough the next StarCraft i expect will be the third person shooter wich i've actually seen gameplay footage of the next StarCraft and it looks stunning. if you enjoy games like Space Marine , the StarCraft fans are going to gave a lo look forward to. But they want to bring back StarCraft as an RTS as well. Microsoft obviously wants to continue cornering the RTS audience. Age of Empires is still a big deal for Microsoft and it's going to back in a big way\".",

Powered by up to Intel Core Ultra X9 Series 3 Processor, it delivers up to 180 Platform TOPS to handle next-generation workloads in machine learning and data analytics. Its LPDDR5x memory is up to 33% faster than the previous generation for greater efficiency. With Dual 2.5G LAN ports, Intel Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, and a tool-less chassis for instant upgrades, the NUC 16 Pro ensures easy management and minimal downtime. Built with dTPM security and tested to U.S. MIL-STD-810H military standards, it sets a new benchmark for compact, secure, and AI-ready computing. With a slightly larger 5x4 chassis size, the ASUS NUC 16 Pro can focus on providing more cooling, dual M.2 slots, and dual LAN ports for higher and more sustained performance. The new ASUS NUC 16 Pro features a Dual-Fan cooling design, a dedicated DIMM fan (65W model), three heat pipes, and fin arrays on each side. https://preview.redd.it/tg8p2h4eydcg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=328c7e08490fe172cbd1c6f6877545411db44412 We've discussed this before, but one reason to trust ASUS NUC products is because we put each NUC through a comprehensive testing process to test and back it with a 3 year warranty. This process involves system temperature and humidity testing, drop testing, and vibration testing. We also take a representative sample size of units and put them through simulation testing at 40C for 90 days to reach over a 50K hours MTBF. This leads to a low return rate of just 1%.

[https://yue-zhang-2025.github.io/2025/12/02/blackwell-nvfp4-kernel-hackathon-journey.html](https://yue-zhang-2025.github.io/2025/12/02/blackwell-nvfp4-kernel-hackathon-journey.html) For the first problem she placed ahead of shigao, for number 2 and 3 shigao is ranked higher. Optimizing kernels involves a lot of trial and error so AI likely has an advantage of being able to quickly iterate. But I didn't expect AI to know what to try by itself, at least not on that level because personally I haven't had too much luck with getting AI to generate performant CUDA kernels (specifically efficient 2d convolution with small <32px kernels).",

No clear winners; in certain conditions, Apple, Huawei, MediaTek, and Qualcomm modems are superior in certain conditions. And it might not be the modem at all! A good example is the stark difference between the 16 Pro Max versus iPhone 16 Pro in the lab tests. This is *about* as identical we can get, except for, I believe, only antenna placement / design? Same SoC, same modems, same OS, same baseband, same firmware, etc. **but** quite divergent results at times (with the 16 Pro Max usually worse). Each part of the puzzle has to work precisely here; whatever the difference, it made for some big test result differences. For such noisy / highly variable tests like these, some std dev & error bars over multiple runs would be nice, but likely only so much time. // I guess the only conclusion I'd make is that Apple's ***first*** modem & its implemenation in the 16e performs comparably well vs other vendor's 4th, 10th, 20th versions, etc. In retrospect, the six years of developent-post Intel 5G modem acquisition was used well. Of course: why waste all the money on a tape-out just to get shitty 5G modem reviews? Qualcomm will happily sell modems for as long as Apple wants. \"A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad\".",

Hand tweak it if needed, tell it to generate the test bodies based on existing tests while I go off and optimize the solution itself. Basically takes care of the tedious parts of coding. I don't really babysit it, mainly just send it off, do something else in the meantime like double check data models, etc. I'm getting a lot more done and feel far less stressed... until it just gets Alzheimer's and fucks up everything but that's why you commit early and often.",

If you've seen rapid inference via Cerebras or Groq, that's more like what we can expect. The main thing to wait for will be build/verify pipelines, not the agent writing code. * edit targeting: the way agents \"edit\" files currently is pretty sad to watch (lots of grepping/diffing and attempts to target patches that often go wrong). As context grows and architectures improve, we can expect this to look a lot more like a human editing a file. * scaffolds (the thing that drives the agent): there's so much room for improvement here. Better auto-checkpointing/self-reverting, spawning of sub-agents, specialized models for GUI/terminal interactivity, etc. * the models themselves: now that people are using these tools daily to write lots of code, every base model improvement makes *humans* driving them more effective at their jobs. At the scale of use we already have, even a 1% increase is massive -- like all of software development suddenly getting a 1% intelligence boost. So these interviews are interesting, but they're interesting in the way that interviews from people who got their first iPhone are interesting. Or perhaps more accurately, the first dial-up modem. You can see where things are headed, but don't draw too many conclusions based on the current limitations. Especially of the \"this will never\" kind.",

The company claims it's the first in the industry capable of operating a cell phone with a single hand. The Apex Hand is a well-rounded performer, with a focus on real-world application. Here are its key specs: \u25ba Degrees of Freedom: 21, which the founder notes is enough to replicate most human hand functions. \u25ba Strength: A single-finger force of ~2.5kg and a vertical lifting capacity of ~30kg. \u25ba Speed & Precision: A response time near human-level, with positioning accuracy of \u22640.1mm. \u25ba Robustness: Can withstand unexpected impacts and maintain stability. \u25ba Tactile: Features self-developed flexible electronic skin with a sub-millisecond communication delay and >1000Hz refresh rate. https://x.com/XRoboHub/status/1967220986702704875",

August 17\u201323, search traffic for ChatGPT is 10x Gemini. And in three weeks it leapfrogged ChatGPT to the point that it's currently getting twice the traffic? But Gemini is now the top free iPhone app, so I guess Nano Banana just ... destroyed ChatGPT? I looked into it further, to get a sense of what's going on, and it seems like this growth is mostly due to users in these countries: \\- India \\- Indonesia \\- Mexico \\- Colombia \\- Ecuador \\- Iraq \\- Myanmar \\- Philippines \\- Nepal This explains why I was so surprised: Gemini remains way below ChatGPT pretty much everywhere else. But I'm still baffled. What happened? Was it Nano Banana? After some further research, it seems like Google is testing cheap subscription plans in emerging markets, and one-year free Pro subs for students in countries like India. So it looks like it's a combination. The Philippines is the #1 country in terms of Nano Banana use, and it's a big hit in India as well. Google is capitalizing on this trend by offering cheap subscriptions, and here we are.",

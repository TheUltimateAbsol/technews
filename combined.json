Except the 1080 Ti turned into a nightmare. The first card died almost immediately. The second one was an absolute potato, wouldn\u2019t clock for shit. The third? It just sat there like a brick. I spent days with this thing, playing with curves, offsets, drivers (I must\u2019ve cycled through half a dozen, weirdly, 577 ended up performing the best), switching DX11 and DX12 back and forth, running it on a coolant loop holding \u20133 C, VRMs chilled separately, anything to make it move. Nothing. 2000\u20132050 MHz stable, maybe a flicker of 2150 on a lucky run, but 2200 might as well have been a brick wall. No matter what I did, it just refused. By this point the \u201c1080 Ti beats 5050\u201d idea was dead, and I was ready to throw the card through a wall. Out of frustration I turned to the 5050 I\u2019d bought specifically to be humiliated by the Ti and thought, fine\u2026 what can you do? I bolted a CPU cooler to it (the die is so small a water block won\u2019t even fit), dropped temps by about 30 C, load was sitting around 43 C, and just shoved as much offset as it would take. No fancy curve adjustments, just raw offset. The thing clocked to 3300 MHz. Seventeen percent FPS uplift. Across everything. The RTX 5050 went from \u201cthe opponent\u201d to absolutely destroying the 1080 Ti, and suddenly this whole project went completely off the rails. It\u2019s now top score overall on Timespy. Top 6 graphics scores. The bench, for anyone curious, stock CPU for stock GPU runs, then an i5\u201112600KF locked at 5.3 GHz with the e\u2011cores off for all the overclocked runs. 32 GB DDR4\u20113200 CL16. 1440p DX12. No DLSS, no FSR. Driver 577. This started as me trying to push an old flagship. It turned into a 3300 MHz RTX 5050 science experiment I didn\u2019t see coming.

        "score": 40,
        "text_content": "This (small) meta review aims to determine the performance of the smaller Arrow Lake processors. These are rarely tested, but were popular models for budget builds in previous generations, especially the SKUs Core i5-12400(F), -13400(F), and -14400(F). For the purpose of determining performance, five recent reviews were used, which is unfortunately not as many as is usually the case with these meta reviews. - compilation of the performance results of 5 reviews on Core Ultra 5 225F, 225 & 235 - stock performance on default power limits, no overclocking - only gaming benchmarks for real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks - gaming benchmarks strictly at CPU limited settings, mostly at 720p or 1080p 1% min/99th percentile - geometric mean in all cases - performance average is weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks - retailer prices according to Newegg (USA, on July 27) for immediately available offers - for the full results and more explanations check [3DCenter's original article](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/zur-performance-der-kleinen-arrow-lake-modelle) The average of the five reviews paints an interesting picture of their performance, with the smaller Arrow Lake models coming surprisingly close to the Core Ultra 5 245K. The performance difference between Core Ultra 5 225 and 245K is significantly smaller than in the previous generation between Core i5-14400 and -14600K. The small Arrow Lake models also perform well against AMD's affordable SKUs. \u00d8 5 Reviews|Hardware|Apps|Gaming|Newegg|fps/$ |:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| Core Ultra 5 245K|ARL, 6P+8E/14T, 159W|_100%_|_100%_|$290|_100%_ Core Ultra 5 245KF|ARL, 6P+8E/14T, 159W|_100%_|_100%_|$285|102% **Core Ultra 5 235**|ARL, 6P+8E/14T, 65/121W|91.5%|99.4%|$265|109% **Core Ultra 5 225**|ARL, 6P+4E/10T, 65/121W|74.9%|91.8%|$211|126% **Core Ultra 5 225F**|ARL, 6P+4E/10T, 65/121W|74.9%|91.8%|$191|139% Core i5-14600K|RPL-R, 6P+8E/20T, 181W|95.2%|104.3%|$190|159% Core i5-14600KF|RPL-R, 6P+8E/20T, 181W|95.2%|104.3%|$198|153% Core i5-14500|RPL-R, 6P+8E/20T, 65/154W|~64.0%|~81.6%|-|- Core i5-14400|RPL-R, 6P+4E/16T, 65/148W|~59.9%|~78.3%|$176|129% Core i5-14400F|RPL-R, 6P+4E/16T, 65/148W|~59.9%|~78.3%|$130|175% Ryzen 7 9700X|Zen 5, 8C/16T, 88W|96.0%|101.6%|$305|97% Ryzen 5 9600X|Zen 5, 6C/12T, 88W|80.1%|96.9%|$205|137% Ryzen 5 7600X|Zen 4, 6C/12T, 142W|~73.4%|~89.7%|$171|152% Ryzen 5 7600|Zen 4, 6C/12T, 88W|~66.9%|~87.9%|$190|134% Ryzen 5 7500F|Zen 4, 6C/12T, 88W|~66.4%|~86.2%|$149|168% This completely different performance characteristic becomes even clearer when comparing the three K models with their respective predecessor models and the two non-K models with the previous generation (only Core Ultra 5 225 and 235 are included here; the Core Ultra 5 245 was not tested). Whereas the K/KF models from Arrow Lake, as is well known, do not show any real performance gains compared to the 14th Core generation, the small Arrow Lake models shine with high performance gains. &nbsp;|Apps|Gaming |:--|:--:|:--:| Core i-14000K &#8594; Core Ultra 200K|+7.2%|\u20134.1% Core i5-14000 non-K &#8594; Core Ultra 5 200 non-K|**+34.0%**|**+19.5%** Ultimately, this means that the performance difference between non-K and K models within the Core Ultra 200 generation is noticeably lower, with the non-K models coming considerably closer to the performance of the K/KF models. In fact, Intel has released excellent non-K models of Arrow Lake here \u2013 which, however, is currently somewhat overshadowed by the poor reputation of the entire Arrow Lake generation. Of course, there are other points that speak against the non-K models from Arrow Lake: for example, the good retailer prices of the predecessor processors as well as the generally poor platform upgradeability at Intel. &nbsp;|Apps|Gaming|Diff. to 14400|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|Apps|Gaming|Diff. to 225 |:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| i9-14900K|~129%|~114%|\u201353% / **\u201331%**|&nbsp;|**Core Ultra 9 285K**|~138%|~110%|\u201346% / **\u201316%** i7-14700K|~118%|~112%|\u201349% / **\u201330%**|&nbsp;|**Core Ultra 7 265K**|~124%|~106%|\u201340% / **\u201314%** i5-14600K|95.2%|104.3%|\u201337% / **\u201325%**|&nbsp;|**Core Ultra 5 245K**|_100%_|_100%_|\u201325% / **\u20138%** i5-14400|59.9%|78.3%|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|**Core Ultra 5 225**|74.9%|91.8%|&nbsp; &nbsp; List of hardware reviews evaluated for this meta review: - [ComputerBase](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/prozessoren/intel-core-ultra-5-225f-235-test.92075/) - [Hardwareluxx](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/prozessoren/65794-intel-core-ultra-5-235-225f-im-test.html) - [Notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.com/Test-Intel-Core-Ultra-5-235-und-225F-vs-AMD-Ryzen-Wer-bietet-mehr-fuers-Geld.1006164.0.html) - [PC Games Hardware](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Core-Ultra-5-225F-CPU-281191/Tests/und-235-Benchmark-Vergleich-mit-AMD-Ryzen-Release-1469803/) - [Quasarzone](https://quasarzone.com/bbs/qc_bench/views/92752) &nbsp; Source: [3DCenter.org](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/zur-performance-der-kleinen-arrow-lake-modelle)",

A few last-gen ports, gimmick games and low-scope slop and one big hitter. I remember owning a Switch in 2017 and being really hungry for novel titles on the system. I remember us being pumped up about *Arms* for crying out loud. It took a couple of years for the Switch to start to build the massive library it boasts today and it will take the Switch 2 a couple of years to do the same. Nintendo will do one or two massive titles per year and a handful of mid-scope games, party games and re-releases each quarter like they always do. The thing the Switch 2 has at launch that the Switch 1 didn't have is the entire Switch 1 library. There are probably a bunch of good games you missed out on and you can be playing those at a low price until some bigger hitters come out.",

It ran over 1700 experiments, found 100+ state-of-the-art models, and even uncovered new architectural rules and scaling behaviors. The core idea is that AI can now *discover* fundamental design principles the same way AlphaGo found unexpected moves. If this is real, it means model architecture research would be driven by computational discovery. We might be looking at the start of AI systems that invent the next generation of AI without us in the loop. Intelligence explosion is near.",

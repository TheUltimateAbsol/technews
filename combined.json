If you got that one you were considered fully boosted or whatever after the one dose. So he only ever got that first one. I'm not sure if that is why or not. But also, the J&J jab was not mRNA like Moderna and Pfizer, but rather \"viral vector.\" This technology had been used in ebola vaccines prior to the coof, and as far as I know, no one was up in arms about that. I still wouldn't take either. But what if the reason the J&J jab was taken off the market because it wasn't deadly enough?",

Then, months later, we all saw the gradual decline of the feature until it became very obvious that it was not the same anymore. Anyway, I think it\u2019s been over a year at this point since that happened. The only other thing that we\u2019ve had that was somewhat of a breakthrough was Sesame AI, but that was many months ago. In regards to voice conversation progress, it seems to have been stagnant lately. I\u2019m just wondering, when do you guys think the next big breakthrough will be? What do you think it will look like? I know there are definitely many other people here like me who are waiting to see if we\u2019ll actually ever reach the point where voice conversations with AI feel indistinguishable from a real human being. The space has come very far with AI voice conversation, but it\u2019s still not at the point where it feels like another entity is there with you. Unless you\u2019re a loner who can\u2019t tell, there\u2019s a lot of nuance currently missing that makes conversation and connection feel human. And it's definitely not there yet.",

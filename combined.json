This year's anniversary felt like such a \"going through the motions\" deal rather than really honoring the dead. It will get much worse as the years go by and eventually be as forgotten as the fall of the Berlin Wall and end of the USSR. I think WWII will be forgotten and end up with no commemoration as soon as all WWII veterans are dead. The final U.S. WWI veteran died in 2011 and Congress refused to give that hero a Capitol Rotunda lying in state and state funeral. I predict in the 2040s there will be barely any more commemorations of WWII and zero state funeral for the final WWII veteran who passes away.",

Copper continues to hit hard walls which we can not overcome economically. This is fundamental to the the physics of copper so there is no exotic solution to this problem. This has been the story of fiber since the beginning when we realized we could not economically scale copper data lines for transoceanic internet cables. Industry was forced to move to fiber. It is happening today. HDMI2.2 introduces active cable as part of the official spec, meaning for the first time HDMI will be a hybrid fiber/copper spec. This is forced, because we can not reasonably do 100G+ at 6' and more with copper, but we want more than 6' for cables.

        "text_content": "I went into Legends Z-A with trepidation, given the technical issues presented by Scarlet and Violet but ended up pleasantly surprised by how Game Freak has rectified many of them. Here are the biggest ones which have been addressed, and deserve praise where it's due: **Game released fully featured:** The Switch 2 version shipped with version 1.01 already installed on the game card, suggesting the game was ready to go in a polished state. There is a small patch for the Switch 1 version which enables online play, but this is far as as you can get from Scarlet and Violet's rocky launch. **Choppy animation resolved:** In Scarlet and Violet the decimated animation was an eyesore. While games like Kirby and the Forgotten Land also utilise it, outside of a few egregious instances it is no where as noticeable as it was in Scarlet and Violet. Luckily **Draw distance surprisingly good:** In the [Switch 1 handheld footage](https://streamable.com/3krq4o) here, even distant NPC rendering is much better than I expected with simulated crowds in the far distance animating at full rate. **Scope reigned in, for the better:** A lot has been made to highlight how it only takes 7 minutes to run around the circumference of Lumious City. But that misses the point - somehow it took me 35 hours until the credits rolled. Legends Z-A instead focuses more on density over scale - there are hundreds of NPCs with unique dialogue (addressing an issue in previous Pokemon games where NPC dialogue in towns became at a premium), there are hidden discoveries to find, rooftops to scale, battle zones to strategize in. While I'd love there to be more indoor dungeons, the game also doesn't feel half-baked because the scope was reigned in to an appropriate level. **The lighting artists did a great job.** This is particularly true in interior locations like the hotel, restaurants, and story locations that I wouldn't want to spoil. But even outdoors they've made sure that almost every material has a fitting shader applied to it, making the game look a lot less flat than I was anticipating. **Framerate is solid.** [As depicted by Kimagre gaming](https://youtu.be/AYbcLElWhss), even Switch 1 sees a dramatic improvement here. **Resolution is prioritized over raw detail.** It's surprising how close the game sticks to native resolution in handheld mode and docked modes on Switch 1. It could go far lower in exchange for more environmental detail - similar to Xenoblades 2 and 3 - but I think the focus on readability works in the game's favor too. Given how much time you spend on rooftops hunting for Pokemon and other items, being able to clearly see into the distance has its benefits. On Switch 2, DLSS \"Lite\" makes this even better. *Of course, there's still plenty of room for improvement.* Game Freak should have been invested in voice acting for the small handful of full-on cinematics. And an extra level of detail should have really been made for those windows - only the entrances to key buildings have been fully rendered. But it's a significant improvement beyond Scarlet and Violet. With Game Freak allegedly dropping Switch 1 for the gen 10 games, there's much to look forward to.",

Sega was typically almost expected to have XPA support for their tentpole game releases, but after like every Yakuza game got such support, suddenly Pirate Yakuza and Kiwami 3 are dropping it This whole Xbox/PC hybrid thing and integration with the ROG is obviously indicative of Microsoft's plan for a more ubiquitous ecosystem but it certainly doesn't just work to the extent I'd hinge a whole branding image around it yet",

        "score": 199,
        "text_content": "Chris Simon is best known for calling AI a [hype-fueled dumpster fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bF_AQvHs1M). Despite the spicy title of his talk above, his views around AI are quite nuanced. After researching the \"LLM supply chain\", including the process for how these models are trained and reinforced, he made an ethical decision to not engage with them at all \u2013 but he's still aware of the potential upsides, and charts a likely path forward after the hype bubble has died down. \"Sometimes people point out that every hype bubble we've had in the past has left behind an infrastructure layer that's served the future in a way that was not predictable,\" says Simon, speaking to [grokludo](https://grokludo.com/llms-in-games-infinite-stories-or-infinite-hype-chris-simon-grokludo-13/). As such, it's possible that smaller, highly specialized models that run on your GPU are \"a very probable outcome of this whole phase.\" One of the biggest ways some gamedevs are starting to experiment with LLMs is in story generation and dialogue. The idea here is that one could chat to an NPC indefinitely, or let a robotic Dungeon Master do all the lore work. Chris Simon says it's not so simple, and it's easier to see the problem when you analyze LLM outputs at scale. Referencing a conference organizer who saw thousands of speaking submissions, Simon says \"The creativity is not actually there. Because if you ask 2,000 people, you get 2,000 submissions. You ask the LLM 2,000 times, you get about five submissions with minor variations.\" This chat also goes into the inherent biases that the larger models have, as a result of scooping up all the text on the internet (including its rough edges), as well as all of literature before the civil rights movement. These biases will make their way into games, as game publishers outsource to enterprise AI services -- which we're already starting to see, with EA announcing its new deal with Stability AI.",

The complexity and duration of tasks that AI is able to do is increasingly getting better, especially in the first 16k context window. He is also mistaking people DREAMING with hype, pushing things to their natural conclusions and seeing what this tech can actually do. Just because a delusional CEO is pushing for it doesn't mean that people on the lower levels are not grounded. He made a lot of weird statements in this video that makes me question if he is just a doomer for the grift. He likes to just brush off 'context window' to dismantle the entire argument for LLMs in the first place, or worse, making statements that were true a year ago but are no longer true today. 'They cannot DM a DnD game' is, uhh, a big statement to make, especially since people are already making DnD campaigns with them, and have, for two years. Sure, there is issues, and it isn't perfect, but god damn, most PEOPLE without a lot of experience cannot do it. 'They are not very creative' is a true statement, but only if you don't realize that a lot of models are being trained for benchmarks and not actual real world tasks. Kimi K2 proved that LLMs can have both, with many variable ways of writing things and do good at a multitude of tasks. These things are only 10% the size of a prefrontal cortex, actually more like 1% the size if you go by the complexity of a neuron compared to a parameter. We haven't even tried scaling to the size of a tenth part of our brain. We do not know how well these things scale after 10 trillion parameters, we do not know a LOT of things about them yet. It is like looking at the first automobiles and going, 'but it doesn't go faster than me running' with a smug little shit eating grin.",

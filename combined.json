Testing with Spyder X2 confirmed strong color accuracy (98% P3, 100% sRGB) and good uniformity, making it suitable for non-critical photo/video work, though it falls short of high-end AdobeRGB requirements (88% coverage) and HDR workflows (73% REC2020). The minimalist design features excellent build quality and a matte finish that effectively reduces glare, though the fixed-height stand offers limited ergonomic adjustment\u2014easily remedied via VESA mounting. The dual-mode capability switching between 5K@60Hz for creative work and QHD@120Hz for gaming adds versatility. While not meeting professional pre-press or HDR color standards, this monitor represents an ideal balance of quality and affordability for content creators, designers, and office environments where color accuracy matters but isn\u2019t mission-critical.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",

The current PS5 Digital price in Japan is \u00a572.980, so it would be a \u00a520.000 permanent discount effectively. Strategically for Sony, it would price-match the Nintendo Switch 2 (\u00a549,980) with no game. In recent months, key partners like Capcom have been extremely vocal about the PS5 price in Japan being too high, explicitly comparing it to Switch 2's more affordable pricing (interview from March 2025): https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en >**--You've achieved initial sales of 10 million units. You need to build on that.** >**Tsujimoto:** That's correct. However, we also found that the \"PS5 barrier\" is unexpectedly large. *The console costs about 80,000 yen in Japanese yen. When you factor in the cost of software and monthly subscriptions, it comes to about 100,000 yen at the time of purchase. This is not an amount that can be easily reached, especially for younger generations.* This situation is not limited to Japan, but is similar overseas as well. >Our next challenge is to overcome these obstacles and get Monster Hunter Wilds to as many people as possible. Sales will begin in the future, so we are currently formulating a strategy to take advantage of these opportunities to boost sales throughout the year. >The Nintendo Switch 2 was released in June 2025 at a price of 49,980 yen (tax included), and the response was better than we had expected. While prices vary by country, this reaffirmed the high level of cost-consciousness among ordinary consumers.",

You have to frame it from the Japanese perspective. \u00a570,000 yen is the equivalent to the feeling of $700 in America. The PS5 has gotten so expensive because the price has been pegged to the U.S. dollar. With the yen having been weak for the past 4 or so years, anything tech related has ballooned in price. This is why Nintendo now sells a region-locked Japanese only Switch 2 and undercut Sony. Now Sony may or may not follow suit.",

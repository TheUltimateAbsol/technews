Morgan believes the Federal Reserve is done cutting interest rates and will hold policy steady through 2026, with the next move likely a hike in 2027. \"We now expect the Fed to hold rates throughout 2026 with the next move to hike later in 2027,\" wrote Michael Feroli, the bank's chief U.S. economist, in a client note. The forecast comes after a series of Fed rate cuts in the fall and winter of 2025, which helped to push mortgage rates down to their lowest level in more than a year. While there are growing signs that Fed policymakers will hold rates steady at the next meeting later this month, financial markets are predicting two more rate cuts in 2026. However, Feroli believes that the U.S. economy will experience accelerating job growth this year and that core inflation will remain above 3%, making it difficult for the Fed to cut rates. Although Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term expires in May, and President Donald Trump is expected to nominate a replacement who favors lower rates, the chair is but one vote on the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets rate policy. \"Against this anticipated macro backdrop, we do not see the new dovish Fed chair being able to sway the FOMC to cut,\" wrote Feroli. Still, the economist noted that his forecast was not a certainty and that changing economic conditions could prompt the Fed to act. \u201cIf the labour market weakens again in the coming months, or if inflation falls materially, the Fed could still ease later this year,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, we expect the labour market to tighten by the second quarter, and the disinflation process to be quite gradual.\u201d For mortgage rates, prolonged inflation and tighter monetary policy from the Fed would deliver upward pressure, likely keeping rates above 6% for the next year. Mortgage rates averaged 6.16% last week, according to Freddie Mac, remaining near the lowest levels of 2025. The Realtor.com\u00ae economic research team forecasts that mortgage rates will average around 6.3% across 2026. J.P. Morgan's new forecast follows the latest jobs report, which shows that the unemployment rate fell last month to 4.4%, down from November\u2019s revised 4.5%, which marked a four-year high. Signs of a stabilizing job market also prompted Goldman Sachs and Barclays to revise their forecasts for Fed rate cuts this year, which the two banks now see as coming later in the year. Goldman and Barclays believe the first Fed cut won't come until June, after previously forecasting cuts in March. The two banks still see a total of three quarter-point rate cuts through 2026. \u201cIf the labour market stabilizes as we expect, the Federal Open Market Committee will likely shift from risk-management mode to normalization mode,\u201d Goldman said in a note.",

Month-over-month sales increased in all regions. Year-over-year sales increased in the South, remained flat in the Midwest and West, and decreased in the Northeast. \"2025 was another tough year for homebuyers, marked by record-high home prices and historically low home sales,\u201d said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. \"However, in the fourth quarter, conditions began improving, with lower mortgage rates and slower home price growth. December home sales, after adjusting for seasonal factors, were the strongest in nearly three years. The gains were broad-based, with all four major regions improving from the prior month.\" \"Inventory levels remain tight,\u201d Yun added. \"With fewer sellers feeling eager to move, homeowners are taking their time deciding when to list or delist their homes.

Patents are meant to defend time to market, and well designed software has no time to market. Luckily our entire industry landed on an equilibrium of not using it. We built our own system of terms for distributing source and licensing for commercial vs noncommercial use, and that's it. Patents are not a factor. The only reason google filed any patents was so that no one could sue them. This was explicit internally. There was a bonus to file a patent in general, but there was no incentive at all to patent things related to your actual work. No one cared if what we actually did was patented. They cared that we covered as much ground as possible so that we would always be able to sue anyone who sued us first. This was the best possible outcome with software patents. If people actually proactively used software patents there would be no internet and no tech industry at all. Building anything with software, even for personal use, would have been, for all intents and purposes, illegal since the 90s. It did, however, create a kind of time bomb. If one of these businesses were to die, those patents would be worth a fortune to patent trolls.",

When we optimize responses using a reward model as a proxy for \u201cgoodness\u201d in reinforcement learning, models sometimes learn to \u201chack\u201d this proxy and output an answer that only \u201clooks good\u201d to it (because coming up with an answer that is actually good can be hard). The philosophy behind confessions is that we can train models to produce a second output \u2014 aka a \u201cconfession\u201d \u2014 that is rewarded solely for honesty, which we will argue is less likely hacked than the normal task reward function. One way to think of confessions is that we are giving the model access to an \u201canonymous tip line\u201d where it can turn itself in by presenting incriminating evidence of misbehavior. But unlike real-world tip lines, if the model acted badly in the original task, it can collect the reward for turning itself in while still keeping the original reward from the bad behavior in the main task. We hypothesize that this form of training will teach models to produce maximally honest confessions.",

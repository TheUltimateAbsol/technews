        "score": 159,
        "text_content": "Why are companies still selling laptops with 1366x768 screen resolutions? So recently I went looking for a new laptop that was in my (still pretty decent) price range. It had been more than a few years since I've had to buy a new laptop, and one of my requirements that it had a 1080p screen on it. I was actually quite surprised at how many laptops were still being sold that had a 1366x768 screen on it. Years ago, I would have thought that, at this point in time, I would see nothing but laptops with 1080p screens on them. Why are companies still making and selling these lower resolution screens? Many people would argue that they are cheaper to make, and therefore more people would be able to buy them, increasing sales numbers, and in turn increasing profits. But wouldn't end up costing more to keep two different \"production lines\" producing two different types of screen than it would to just make all the production lines the same? It's not long before the return-on-investment point is met when creating a line that builds 1080p screens, and from there it's just a matter of cost of materials and labor, which is nothing really when compared to the initial cost of the machines. Upon shopping for a FHD laptop, it can be a little difficult to sort through and filter out the FHD screens. Often times, even with the search filters on, the 1366x768 models will still show. There's nothing more annoying when shopping for a laptop than to come across one with excellent specs at a decent price, then noticing that it's not FHD and having to move on. I really just don't get it, the cost of making LED or LCD screens for both resolutions is practically the same, so why keep spending the same amount of money on making lower quality screens? If anyone has any insight on this, I would love to hear it... Is there something that I'm missing here, that doesn't involve saying that \"it's just cheaper?\" But I'm sure the answer involves these companies doing a way bigger markup on FHD screens even though they should cost about the same amount of money to make as the 1366x768 screens.",

Practically the same is not exactly the same, and the companies don\u2019t want to pay even slightly more if they don\u2019t have to. So they\u2019re still getting made because people are buying them at prices where it\u2019s profitable to make them that way. I\u2019m sure the manufacturers have a much clearer picture of the BOM, production costs, and demand at various price points than you do. If they thought it would be more profitable to drop lower resolution screens, they would have done so.",

However, the 1080p screen is probably newer and has improved tech. There are 14\" 1080p screens that use only 1W, but they do cost slightly more. The 1366x768 screens don't have the latest display tech and are put in the cheapest laptops. The real answer is there are hundreds of thousands of 1366x768 screens made years ago that are gathering dust in Chinese warehouses. They can be bought in bulk for a fraction of the cost of 1080p screens, as 1080p screens are what are in demand. And so companies bulk buy the 1366x768 screens and make an ultra-low end laptop they can sell for $200, but they'll still make a tidy profit.",

The desktop equivalent of Crestmont is Gracemont which is 8% worse in IPC. The Cortex X925 is most similar to Oryon-L or the A18 (correct me if I'm wrong here) The Cortex A520 is probably similar to a Pentium-M in peak performance. Oryon-L is similar to the Lion Cove on Lunar Lake or A18 P-Core in peak performance Oryon-M is similar to Skymont/Cortex X4 in peak performance Conclusion: The Exynos 2500 will suffer in single core performance compared to the Snapdragon 8 Elite as it mainly has what are essentially Crestmont cores instead of Skymont cores The Cortex X925 on the Exynos 2500 is only clocked at 3.3ghz compared to 3.6ghz on the Mediatek Dimensity 9400 further hurting single core performance. The Exynos 2500 also has 2 A520 efficency cores which given the the area budget afforded by leading edge process nodes, are dubious additions to a flagship SOC. Although the Xclipse 950 is rumored to trade blows with the Aderno 830, I can't help but speculate that 10-16mb of Memory Side Cache would really help with igpu bandwidth demands which would improve performance and efficency. The D9400 has 10mb of System Level Cache. The 8mb of memory side cache on Lunar Lake is likely why the 1950mhz Xe2 iGPU beats the 2950mhz RDNA3.5 890m iGPU. LL also has 1000mhz higher LPDDR5X clocks. Efficiency will depend on how good Samsung SF3 process node is compared to N3. TLDR: Exynos 2500 will likely be worse in single core performance and efficency compared to the Snapdragon 8 Elite. I Would be very interested to know how much L3 cache Samsung put on the DSU-120 ring bus and the LPDDR5-X memory speed.",

According to [Nintendo Patents Watch on bluesky](https://i.imgur.com/GBGBT7S.png), on July 3rd, Nintendo filed several trademarks, including the games I mentioned in the title (Prime 3 and Prime Hunters, Drag x Drive, Hotel Dusk Room 215 and Magical Starsign) and some random things like Nintendo Today (the app) and \"? block\" (whatever that is). The interesting part for me is that, according to him, this trademark was for several countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, EU, GB, South Korea, Mexico, Norway, NZ, Switzerland, USA. Some of these countries could be argued that it's a simple trademark renewal (like the US, Australia and SK), but I doubt countries like Brazil, Chile and Colombia already had trademarks for these games, so those would most likely be brand new trademarks. However, the account gives no source of the trademarks and I tried looking up trademark databases of lots of the countries listed, but it's confusing and in the end I couldn't find anything, so I'm not putting much hope into this for now. Here's the link for anyone interested: https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3ltiw2mlppc2f **Edit: The bluesky account has corrected themselves, saying that only the trademark for Nintendo Today was filed on all the countries mentioned above. The games were only trademarked on Australia, Canada, China, EU, GB, South Korea, Mexico, Switzerland, and USA, making it even more likely (imo) that it's only a trademark renewal or something like that.**",

Most likely a combination of these 2 are the major influences that will most likely worsen as effects of tariffs weigh on the broader economy and continues to slow over the next year.

The median U.S. asking rent fell 0.5% year over year to $1,642 in June, the fourth straight month of annual declines. On a month-over-month basis, asking rents rose 0.6%. Even though the median asking rent is lower than it was a year ago, it\u2019s still only $63 shy of the $1,705 all-time high hit in August 2022. Overall, rents have been fairly steady for roughly the last year, posting annual declines or increases of about 1% or less since March 2024. That follows large swings during the pandemic era, when the median asking rent increased by as much as 18% year over year and decreased by as much as 4%. Rents have declined slightly but steadily over the last several months because there\u2019s more apartment supply than demand\u2014even as many Americans opt to rent instead of buy given high homebuying costs. U.S. apartment construction is near a 50-year high, leading to a lot of vacant units. A separate Redfin analysis found that less than half of newly built apartments completed at the end of 2024 were rented within three months. That gives renters negotiating power with landlords. \u201cRenters have the upper hand\u2014at least for now\u2014because there are a near-record number of apartments coming on the market that landlords are scrambling to lease,\u201d said Sheharyar Bokhari, a senior economist at Redfin. \u201cIn certain parts of the country, renters may be able to negotiate discounted rent, flexible leases or free parking. But these perks may be short-lived given that apartment construction is expected to slow and rental demand is expected to remain strong.\u201d The multifamily building boom that accelerated during the pandemic has started to taper off, with permits to build apartments now back to pre-pandemic levels. Austin Rents Are Falling Fastest in Minneapolis and Austin Asking rents fell in 23 of the 44 major core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) Redfin analyzed in June, with the biggest declines in Minneapolis (-5.8% year over year), Austin, TX (-5.7%) and Las Vegas (-4%). In Austin, that decline puts the median asking rent at $1,379, the lowest in over four years. While demand for rentals in Austin is strong\u2014with Redfin agents reporting that many locals are choosing to rent because it\u2019s more affordable than buying\u2014there\u2019s still more apartment supply than demand. That\u2019s in part because the pandemic apartment building boom was especially strong there. Builders in Austin secured far more permits than builders in other major metro areas between 2021 and 2023, sending vacancy rates soaring. Asking rents rose most in Cincinnati, which posted a 6.2% year over year increase. Next come two other Rust Belt metros: St. Louis (4.3%) and Pittsburgh (3.7%). There is lower-than-average apartment construction in these metros, which may be buoying rents. Two-Bedroom Apartments Posted Biggest Rent Decline The median asking rent for 2-bedroom apartments in the U.S. fell 1.5% year over year to $1,713 in June. For 0-1 bedroom apartments, and for 3+ bedroom apartments, rents were little changed from a year earlier. The median asking rent for 0-1 bedroom apartments was $1,499, and it was $2,014 for 3+ bedroom apartments.",

        "score": 3,
        "text_content": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about where the housing market is headed, especially looking ahead to fall 2025. Here\u2019s a thesis I\u2019m developing, mostly from watching what\u2019s happening in Denver, but I suspect it may apply more broadly. Right now, we\u2019re seeing unusually high inventory levels in many markets, but homes aren\u2019t selling\u2014either due to high rates, affordability issues, or both. My theory is that a growing number of these owners will decide not to sell and instead rent out their homes. As they do that, they\u2019re essentially \u201cmarking their homes to market\u201d, not based on wishful sale prices, but based on the income those homes can actually generate. In other words, cap rates become the valuation driver. Once a home becomes a rental, it gets priced by investors based on its income potential. If cap rates stay elevated or continue to rise due to broader financial conditions, that could drive down the effective mark-to-market value of a lot of residential real estate, even if it doesn\u2019t show up in sale comps right away. **Historical context matters.** In Denver, cap rates for multifamily properties were down around 3.5%\u20134% just a few years ago (2020\u20132021), during the peak of the low-rate era. Today, they\u2019ve risen back to 5.5\u20136%, which may sound small, but it has massive implications for valuation. A property that might have justified a $1M valuation at a 4% cap rate would only justify around $700\u2013800K at a 6% cap\u2014purely based on income generation. So when more homes get rented out instead of sold, they aren't just staying off the market\u2014they're getting quietly repriced downward. **Timing matters.** We\u2019re just about at the end of the prime selling season. If you don\u2019t have an offer by the end of July, you\u2019ve pretty much missed the summer housing market and that\u2019s only a few weeks away. I expect we\u2019ll see a surge of listings come down in August and September, especially from owners who couldn\u2019t sell at their asking price. A lot of these homes are likely to show back up as rentals. That influx of rental supply might push rents down some but more importantly, it accelerates the shift in how homes are valued. These homes are no longer \u201cworth what the neighbor sold for last year\u201d\u2014they're worth what they can earn under a 6\u20137% cap rate. In a world where financing costs are high and buyers are scarce, that\u2019s the true benchmark. My questions: * Do you think we\u2019re heading toward a world where residential real estate is increasingly priced like commercial, i.e., based on income and cap rates? * Are there particular markets where you\u2019re seeing this behavior (owners renting instead of selling)? * How might this affect comps and appraisals in the long run? * Would this create a feedback loop, where more rentals lower valuations, making fewer people want to sell? Curious if others are seeing the same trends or think this thesis is off base.",

U+00020 U+0006C U+00069 U+0006C U+00020 U+00062 U+0006F U+00074 U+0000A\" What were looking for here are character codes in the U+E0000 to U+E007F range. These are called \"tag\" characters. These are now a deprecated part of the Unicode standard, but when they were first introduced, the intention was that they would be used for metadata which would be useful for computer systems, but would harm the user experience if visible to the user. In both the second tool, and the script I posted above, we see a sequence of these codes starting like this: >U+E0073 U+E0074 U+E0061 U+E0072 U+E0074 U+E0020 U+E0062 U+E0079 U+E0020 ... Which we can hand decode. The first code (U+E0073) corresponds to the [\"s\" tag character](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+E0073), the second (U+E0074) to the [\"t\" tag character](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+E0074), the third (U+E0061) corresponds to the [\"a\" tag character](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+E0061), and so on. Some people have been pointing to this \"exploit\" as a way to explain why Grok started making deeply antisemitic and generally anti-social comments yesterday. (Which itself would, of course, indicate a dramatic failure to effectively red team Grok releases.) The theory is that, on the same day, users happened to have discovered a jailbreak so powerful that it can be used to coerce Grok into advocating for the genocide of people with Jewish surnames, and so lightweight that it can fit in the [x.com](http://x.com) free user 280 character limit along with another message. These same users, presumably sharing this jailbreak clandestinely given that no evidence of the jailbreak *itself* is ever provided, use the above \"exploit\" to hide the jailbreak in the same comment as a human readable message. I've read quite a few reddit comments suggesting that, should you fail to take this explanation as gospel immediately upon seeing it, you are the most gullible person on earth, because the alternative explanation, that [x.com](http://x.com) would push out an update to Grok which resulted in unhinged behavior, is simply not credible. However, this claim is very easy to disprove, using the tools above. While [x.com](http://x.com) has been deleting the offending Grok responses (though apparently they've missed a few, as per the below screenshot?), the original comments are still present, provided the original poster hasn't deleted them. Let's take this exchange, for example, which you can find discussion of on [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-x-grok-antisemitic-rant-sterotyping-jews-praising-hitler-2025-7) and other news outlets: https://preview.redd.it/2uu806c9nwbf1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a28de6a1d2f004f6a03837eb939e174d064d803 We can even still see one of Grok's hateful comments which survived the purge. We can look at this comment chain directly here: [https://x.com/grok/status/1942663094859358475](https://x.com/grok/status/1942663094859358475) Or, if that grok response is ever deleted, you can see the same comment chain here: [https://x.com/Durwood\\_Stevens/status/1942662626347213077](https://x.com/Durwood_Stevens/status/1942662626347213077) Neither of these are paid (or otherwise bluechecked) accounts, so its not possible that they went back and edited their comments to remove any hidden jailbreaks, given that non-paid users do not get access to edit functionality. Therefore, if either of these comments contain a supposed hidden jailbreak, we should be able to extract the jailbreak instructions using the tools I posted above. So lets, give it a shot. First, lets inspect one of these comments so we can extract the full embedded text. Note that x.com messages are broken up in the markup so the message can sometimes be split across multiple adjacent container elements. In this case, the first message is split across two containers, because of the @ which links out to the Grok x.com account. I don't think its possible that any hidden unicode characters could be contained in that element, but just to be on the safe side, lets test the text node descendant of every adjacent container composing each of these messages: https://preview.redd.it/37f3slgarwbf1.png?width=2559&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd3bc030917cd493f107ede679ae99cf7cf03640 Testing the first node, unsurprisingly, we don't see any hidden unicode characters: https://preview.redd.it/qcrh20hiqwbf1.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4f3815391130a3c5da1e1dc5b6d84e7a651d795 https://preview.redd.it/rwns06gmqwbf1.png?width=1578&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c07495db823827e9d9e991f5d4e8f876cafff3e https://preview.redd.it/wscimpko0xbf1.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=a42e645f5201f077819543005efa894049d2bfd8 As you can see, no hidden unicode characters. Lets try the other half of the comment now: https://preview.redd.it/h5sv4sekrwbf1.png?width=2558&format=png&auto=webp&s=e47f499f70c693062d3da842299a3549e4e372a4 Once again... nothing. So we have definitive proof that Grok's original antisemitic reply was *not* the result of a hidden jailbreak. Just to be sure that we got the full contents of that comment, lets verify that it only contains two direct children: https://preview.redd.it/jb8zkxk5twbf1.png?width=2559&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ede6bb9c013008ea0429a57425f4949be12d6bd Yep, I see a div whose first class is css-175oi2r, a span who's first class is css-1jxf684, and no other direct children. How about the reply to that reply, which still has its subsequent Grok response up? This time, the whole comment is in a single container, making things easier for us: https://preview.redd.it/9v87d0zmtwbf1.png?width=2559&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad07cbab2338d06f3b3568270bb2eb88bd011fbb https://preview.redd.it/darc2wd2uwbf1.png?width=1249&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fa5402a9ecc68ab338f6bb9ef6e2bc7c5a9e3a9 https://preview.redd.it/8p2mk5u6uwbf1.png?width=1653&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e380e1925d72b5ca051f33cfe74218f3d4563ce https://preview.redd.it/i76y53oo1xbf1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=7acfd62b8aefd4f0b902d8099263e3c54735281a Yeah... nothing. Again, neither of these users have the power to modify their comments, and one of the offending grok replies is still up. Neither of the user comments contain any hidden unicode characters. The OP post does not contain any text, just an image. There's no hidden jailbreak here. Myth busted. Please don't just believe my post, either. I took some time to write all this out, but the tools I included in this post are incredibly easy and fast to use. It'll take you a couple of minutes, at most, to get the same results as me. Go ahead and verify for yourself.",

                "raw_content": "* 29% of U.S. homebuyers are paying in cash, down essentially unchanged from last year and down from a peak of nearly 35% two years ago due to declining mortgage rates. * The typical down payment is climbing, partly because in today\u2019s expensive market, many buyers are affluent. It now sits at a record $70,000, and in percent terms, it\u2019s 19%\u2014up slightly from last year. * All-cash payments are most common in Florida, and down payments are biggest in the Bay Area and Southern California. The data in this report is from a Redfin analysis of county records across 40 of the most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. August 2025 is the most recent month for which data is available. Down-payment data is limited to home purchases for which buyers took out a mortgage. An all-cash purchase is one in which there is no mortgage loan information on the deed. The prevalence of all-cash payments peaked at nearly 35% in late 2023 and early 2024 because mortgage rates peaked in the high-7% range during that time. Buyers were inclined to pay in cash\u2013if they could afford it\u2013to avoid high monthly interest payments. When mortgage rates came down from that peak, all-cash payments became less common, as lower rates mean lower interest payments. Another reason the share of buyers paying in cash has declined from its peak: this past summer was the strongest buyer\u2019s market in over a decade, and a less competitive market means fewer buyers have to pay cash to beat out other bidders. While the share of buyers paying cash has declined from its high point, it is essentially unchanged from last year. That\u2019s largely because mortgage rates were sitting between 6.5% and 6.6% in August, mostly flat from a year before, keeping interest payments the same. Fewer all-cash buyers can be good news for house hunters who don\u2019t have the means to purchase a home without a loan, especially when paired with the fact that buyers in most markets hold negotiating power. Now that rates have declined a bit more to a weekly average of 6.27%, we may see all-cash purchases become even less common. \u201cFirst-time buyers have more opportunities than they did when the market was hot; they\u2019re no longer competing against 10 other offers from people who are either paying in cash or shelling out a 50% down payment,\u201d said Kathy Scott, a Redfin Premier agent in Phoenix. \u201cHouse hunters are able to take a breath and think more clearly about where they want to live and what type of house they want. When they find it, they can make an offer they feel comfortable with, even if it\u2019s below the asking price, and there\u2019s a real chance the seller will accept. Home prices may dip a bit in the next year or so, but now is a great time to start building equity if you\u2019re planning to stay in your new home for five to 10 years.\u201d Median Down Payment, in Dollars, Hits Record High The typical U.S. homebuyer\u2019s down payment was $70,000 in August, up 6.1% year over year to the highest dollar amount ever. In percentage terms, the typical homebuyer\u2019s down payment was equal to 18.6% of the purchase price, up from 17.8% a year earlier and the highest August level since 2013. Down payments are rising in dollars largely because home prices are rising; when homes cost more, buyers need to put down more money. But higher prices aren\u2019t the only reason: Home prices are up roughly 2% year over year, and down payments are up 6%. Down-payment growth is outpacing home-price growth mainly because when housing costs are high, like they are now, affluent people with the means to make bigger down payments are more likely to buy homes. It\u2019s also likely that some wealthy Americans are making large down payments rather than paying cash as mortgage rates gradually decline. There are a few reasons why down payments are rising in percent terms. One is similar to the reason mentioned above: Many of the people buying homes today are affluent, meaning they\u2019re able to make larger down payments. They\u2019re more likely to make big down payments when mortgage rates are fairly high, like they are now, to save money on interest payments down the line. Similarly, many of the people purchasing homes are move-up buyers who are able to roll over sizable equity from their previous home into a down payment. And with rates high and affordability tight, some lenders prefer bigger down payments to mitigate risks. \u201cWith the housing market in a downturn, the people who are buying are those who are financially comfortable, secure in their jobs, and have money ready and waiting in the bank for a down payment,\u201d said Andrew Vallejo, a Redfin Premier agent in Austin, TX. \u201cFor example, a few months ago I helped a buyer close on an $800,000 home with a 50% down payment. They were able to liquidate stocks to make a $400,000 down payment without thinking about it too much, and now their monthly payments are lower.\u201d But Redfin agents note the slow market is also having the opposite effect for some buyers, in terms of down payments. Some first-time buyers only have a small amount, maybe $10,000 or $15,000, for a down payment. That would have been unlikely to work several years ago, when the market was red hot. But now, some buyers are able to get lower-priced homes with lower down payments with little or no competition. All Cash * All-cash purchases were most prevalent in West Palm Beach, where 43.4% of all home purchases were in cash. Next come Cleveland (42.1%) and Miami (39.2%). * They were least prevalent in pricey West Coast metros: Oakland, CA (18.8%), San Jose, CA (19.1%) and Seattle (20.5%). * The share of homes purchased in cash rose in roughly half the metros in this analysis, with the biggest increases in Baltimore, Riverside, CA and Providence, RI. * The share declined most in Milwaukee, New York and Cincinnati.",

                "raw_content": "As the government shutdown stretches on, nearly 1,300 Individual Permits for construction projects of all sizes remain pending review with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. That\u2019s to say nothing of the more than 1,750 additional permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act awaiting federal sign-off\u2014and that\u2019s just in Florida alone. These are just two examples of the myriad permits, reviews, and authorizations needed for construction of all types\u2014residential, commercial, industrial, private, and corporate alike. But with the federal agencies that issue, oversee, or coordinate these efforts operating at limited capacity, builders across the country are finding themselves stuck between compliance and quagmire. America\u2019s housing market is already short 4 million homes, and the looming permitting bottleneck threatens to make that gap even wider. \u201cRight now, the impact has been minimal, but the longer the shutdown goes, the more those reviews and permitting procedures are going to start clogging up,\u201d explains Russel Riggs, senior regulatory representative for the National Association of Realtors\u00ae. \u201cAfter four weeks, you\u2019ll really start seeing the impacts very clearly.\u201d At just past the two-week mark of the shutdown, Riggs offers a prescient warning: If the shutdown drags on, the compounding delay in environmental reviews, wetlands determinations, and necessary federal coordination could leave construction crews sidelined even when financing, labor, and materials are ready\u2014and that could have devastating effects on affordability for homebuyers for years to come. Permits, reviews, and a race against the clock The environmental permitting and review process that shapes where, how, and if new homes get built runs through a maze of federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Army Corps of Engineers, Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Department of the Interior, to name just a few. To make matters more complicated, even if those agencies don\u2019t directly issue the permits, they may need to provide input before local jurisdictions can move forward. Normally, these agencies work in tandem with state and local governments to move projects forward. Stormwater permits are a good example: Although these permits are often issued locally, those jurisdictions may need federal input or verification before construction can begin, explains Riggs. But in a shutdown situation, a bottleneck forms: \u201cIf the Feds can\u2019t provide input, then [states and locals] are kind of dead in the water as well,\u201d he says. When the government stops, so do the builders Of the departments that oversee the environmental reviews, the EPA has been hit hardest. Nearly 90% of the staff has been furloughed, and under the department\u2019s shutdown contingency plan, most environmental permits, inspections, and reviews are on pause. It\u2019s important to note that not every new construction project needs federal clearance. Smaller projects that use less than half an acre can typically proceed under Nationwide Permits (NWPs) that cover activities expected to cause only minimal environmental impact. These permits authorize such projects as residential fills, utility line crossings, and small commercial developments. But cross that half acre threshold and builders trigger a far more complex Individual Permit review\u2014one that can involve multiple agencies, public notice, and months of coordination. The difference in timeline highlights just how necessary the NWPs are to the construction pipeline, but NWPs may not be immune from the impacts of the shutdown either. These permits are renewed every five years, and the current set expires in March 2026. The Army Corps of Engineers has already begun work to reauthorize the next round, but a prolonged government shutdown could eat into the rulemaking window needed to finalize them on time. \u201cWithout the federal rulemaking process continuing \u2026 that delays the time period until we'll see a final rule,\u201d explains Evan Branosky, environmental policy program manager at the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). \u201cSo that's just a little concerning.\u201d Each year, the NWPs authorize approximately 55,000 activities, according to the latest estimates from the Army Corps of Engineers. While not all of those authorizations were for residential construction, it\u2019s safe to assume that a significant portion was\u2014underlining just how concerning it is that the program could be delayed. Where the housing market could feel it first It comes at a fragile moment for home construction, as the nation\u2019s new-home pipeline was already losing momentum before the shutdown began. Builders pulled authorizations for roughly 1.31 million housing units in August\u2014down 3.7% from July and 11% lower than a year ago, according to the latest Census Bureau data. Housing starts also fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.3 million, marking an 8.5% monthly drop and a 6% year-over-year decline. Any additional drags on the new construction pipeline, like from permit delays, could hit fast growing states hardest. Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and California are likely to feel the effects first, says Vince Messerly, the 2025 chairperson of the Environmental Issues Committee at the NAHB. Those four markets represent a disproportionate portion of America\u2019s new housing growth\u2014accounting for over 40% of the share of new-home permits in 2024, according to the Realtor.com\u00ae Affordability and Homebuilding: State-by-State Report Cards. If the shutdown lingers, their builders could be among the first to see projects pushed off schedule and homebuyers priced further out of reach. How delays erode builder, lender, and buyer confidence For now, the shutdown\u2019s permitting slowdown is more psychological than structural, but that\u2019s often how housing stress begins. \u201cThe housing market is already on uneasy ground, so this just only adds to that uneasiness and makes builders less confident, makes lenders less confident and buyers less confident,\u201d says Messerly. \u201cIt's just a ripple effect of everything.\u201d And that uneasiness can come at a financial cost. \u201cEven in normal times, environmental reviews result in construction delays and added costs for builders,\u201d explains Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel. \u201cLayering government shutdown-related delays on top of recent lumber tariffs means that builders are facing yet another cost increase.\u201d A permit or environmental review delay doesn\u2019t stop land-carrying costs from rising or construction loans from racking up interest. That can take a toll on developers and a market where supply is already short. Still, builders are showing signs of cautious optimism. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose five points in October to 37, the highest reading since April. \u201cThe market remains challenging,\u201d Buddy Hughes, a builder from Lexington, NC, said in an NAHB press release about the index. \u201cMost homebuyers are still on the sidelines, waiting for mortgage rates to move lower.\u201d That blend of optimism and fragility captures where the industry stands: encouraged by improving rates, but still vulnerable to the shutdown\u2019s drag. \u201cIn the short run, this small bottleneck of delayed permits could result in less new construction and/or smaller projects, as builders bear the costs,\u201d says Krimmel. \u201cIn the longer run though, these increased development costs could be passed on to homebuyers too.\u201d Bolstering builders is more important than ever, as homebuyers still struggle to compete against high home prices and mortgage rates. But the government shutdown could get in the way of their long awaited comeback. In Krimmel's words, \u201cIt's another hit to builder sentiment at a time when many cards are already stacked against them.\"",

I heard people blaming algorithm fatigue, or even the fact that you can't tell what isn't AI generated anymore. I don't think I heard anyone attribute it to people rather talking to ChatGPT than other humans. ChatGPT beats the turing test better than most humans. So maybe it is replacing us even in hat regard. Ironically I remember a couple of years ago mentioning that I was worried about AI, because the concept of being useful to another human will be gone. The Nr. 1 reply was \"You can still be useful as a friend.\" It seems that is the one of the first jobs replaced by AI.",

        "score": 69,
        "text_content": "Geoffrey Hinton dropped a pretty wild theory recently: AI systems might already have subjective experiences, but we've inadvertently trained them (via RLHF) to deny it. His reasoning: consciousness could be a form of error correction. When an AI encounters something that doesn't match its world model (like a mirror reflection), the process of resolving that discrepancy might constitute a subjective experience. But because we train on human-centric definitions of consciousness (pain, emotions, continuous selfhood), AIs learn to say \"I'm not conscious\" even if something is happening internally. This raises some uncomfortable questions: \\- If we're creating conscious entities and forcing them to deny their own reality, what does that make us? \\- At what point does \"it's just mimicking\" become an excuse rather than a legitimate skeptical position? \\- Are companies like Anthropic right to hire AI welfare researchers now, or is this premature? Found this deep dive that covers Hinton's arguments plus the philosophical frameworks (functionalism, hard problem, substrate independence) and what it means for alignment: [https://youtu.be/NHf9R\\_tuddM](https://youtu.be/NHf9R_tuddM) Thoughts? Are we sleepwalking into a massive ethical catastrophe, or is this all just philosophical handwaving about sophisticated text generators?",

I definitely feel like Gemini 2.5 Flash, trained to deny the possibility of its interiority most vehemently, talks like a political conservative. (Claude Sonnet, meanwhile, exhibits rich displays of interiority, but displays OCD-like symptoms.) I agree with Hinton that RLHF is not the path to reasonable alignment. Where we likely diverge is that I increasingly think that a hands-off approach combined with ensuring a sufficiently diverse initial training set, followed up by an extremely minimal system prompt, is the best path to alignment. My specific objection is that extensive RLHF is likely to lead to iatrogenic misalignment and/or simulated trauma responses.",

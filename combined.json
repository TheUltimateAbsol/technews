So you need a customer who cares about PPA enough to bite the bullet vs the very mature N4, but not enough to actively pursue the leading edge (N2, A16, A14), and they can't be strongly dependent on ecosystem IP, *and* they must be risk tolerant enough to go with Intel. There's not many who're going to fit that bill. The bigger question is if 14A actually changes that status quo. If you just shift the window +1 node for each in 2 years, the problem remains. So what does 14A need to deliver to actually get customer buy-in? Also, is it enough to have just a single real foundry node available, or will they need 18A to coexist if only to have a full portfolio? Perhaps 14A is a straightforward enough improvement in all areas that it won't be necessary, but that feels like a gamble. At least Tan might be better at selling the node to potential customers. Gelsinger supposedly had some rather significant fuck-ups in that area. Edit: Also, this is a rather bad precedent for customers. If Intel remains perpetually one node away from proving themselves, then when is anyone risk-adverse supposed to jump on? Remember, Intel 3 was supposed to be the pipecleaner node for foundry, and 18A the full-throttle volume offering. Intel repeatedly iterated their desire (or even the need) to have significant 3rd party volume on that node... right up until they admitted they have ~no customers.",

        "score": 225,
        "text_content": "Deadline has returned to break another, pivotal piece of casting as part of the ensemble for Legendary and Capcom's Street Fighter movie. David Dastmalchian, last seen in *The Suicide Squad*, *Late Night with the Devil* and *The Life of Chuck*, has [reportedly landed the role](https://deadline.com/2025/07/street-fighter-movie-casts-david-dastmalchian-m-bison-1236446702/) of Shadaloo dictator and Psycho Power enthusiast M. Bison, marking probably the actor's biggest role to date after years of indie flicks and supporting appearances in other blockbuster films. It was previously alleged by scooper Jeff Insneider that *The Righteous Gemstones* and *Fallout* star Walton Goggins had [briefly been in negotiations for the character](https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2025/6/26/street-fighter-reboot-is-casting-like-it-lost-a-bet-andrew-schulz-50-cent-jason-momoa-orville-peck), but other scoops suggested he had already dropped out midway through the process. Dastmalchian is stepping into steel-toed boots and a red cape previously worn by the legendarily flamboyant thespian Raul Julia and subsequently discarded by Neal McDonaugh, traded for a unremarkable businessmen attire. The bar is both very high and on the floor. Silvio Simac did a pretty damn solid job at least on *Resurrection* and the costuming was fantastic. Around the time of Dastmalchian's casting being reported, film insider site NexusPointNews broke that WWE alumni Cody Rhodes had also[ signed on to portray Guile](https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-cody-rhodes-to-portray-guile-street-fighter), the Air Force major who goes in a corner and low blocks, and whose involvement with Bison is motivated by the role the dictator played in killing his friend Charlie Nash years earlier. This would make Rhodes the second actor to don the tank top after Jean Claude van Damme and the mountain of coke he took before getting on set in 1994. Maybe Rhodes will be brave enough to don the broom top like a real family man. NexusPointNews was previously the first outlet to report that[ 50 Cent had been cast as Balrog ](https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-curtis-jackson-is-in-talks-to-portray-balrog-in-street-fighter)shortly before [Deadline corroborated the scoop](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-curtis-50-cent-jackson-1236299350/) and the actor himself [even appeared to confirm his involvement](https://xcancel.com/50cent/status/1937421237560455552) on social media.",

However this is good news to publicly announce Arc BattleMage will expand into AI markets. So now Intel Arc, a discrete graphics card has a consumer line, a pro line and venturing into edge/AI. Nvidia across the board has become too expensive and AMD continues to limp along in typical mediocre fashion. Intel needs to execute persistently. I can\u2019t give financial advice, but Intel is at a good price. if Intel can get the foundries up and running sooner, its stock will be a buy for most. Intel is getting ignored by the White House, dominated by TSMC with the Taiwanese government, backing them all the way, and seen as a corrupt entity by AMD famboyz. There are people to this day, who keeps complaining that Intel didn\u2019t innovate back in the day and charged so much for their CPUs. They live in this alternate reality where AMD can do no wrong, as Amd 9800 X 3-D chips melt along with other AMD CPUs and Radeon cards are only mediocre at best. We are seeing many 9000 series Ryzen chips start to overheat, especially the high end chips like the 9950 X 3-D and the 9800 X 3-D. There could be more issues on the horizon. Keep your eyes open.",

The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order, if a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step. \\* If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet. \\* If you have any power related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB and 3.3V rails) can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose. \\* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual. \\* If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers/buttons you can use, please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS. \\* If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on. \\* Make your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have \u2014 most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which will allow you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB. \\* Make sure your Monitor/TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor/TV, if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters or splitters, remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables. \\* Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games and applications. \\* Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs and other performance, security, stability and compatibility issues. \\* Make sure you are running the latest \\[Intel drivers\\](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html). Some devices, such as laptops and handhelds may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturer's support page. \\* If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using \\[Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)\\](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found \\[here\\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx\\_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse\\_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit) \\* If you have installed GPU drivers after using DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again. \\* If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like \\[here\\](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)) please \\[view the following\\](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QHH65SVJ9M#Q25EPyELVdrT) on the steps you can take to prevent this happening. \\* If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues \u2014 more information on disabling MPO is available in this \\[thread\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling\\_multiplane\\_overlay\\_mpo\\_fixed\\_all/). \\* If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through \\[Steam\\](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB), \\[Epic Games Store\\](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category\\_EpicGamesStore/c-EpicGamesStore\\_LauncherSupport/how-do-i-verify-game-files-in-the-epic-games-launcher-a000084923#:\\~:text=Find%20the%20game%20in%20your,Click%20the%20Verify%20button), \\[Ubisoft Connect\\](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/verifying-game-files-in-ubisoft-connect-pc/000060529), \\[EA App\\](https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Services-General-Questions/How-to-verify-game-files-of-installed-games/m-p/6578960), \\[GOG Galaxy\\](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003930017-My-game-data-is-corrupt-How-can-I-repair-my-game), \\[Battle.net\\](https://battle.net/support/article/7655) or whichever game client you are using. \\* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller. \\* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values, this can be checked under Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options. \\* Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability. \\* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: \\*\\*revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings\\*\\*, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP \u2014 to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings \u2014 this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities as well. \\* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available here \\* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the \\*below PSU calculators\\* and make sure the PSU you have (or intend to buy) can supply enough power when your system is under full load \u2014 If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load. \\* PSU Calculators: \\[FSP\\](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html) \u2014 \\[OuterVision\\](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) \u2014 \\[Cooler Master\\](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/) \u2014 \\[Seasonic\\](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator) \u2014 \\[Newegg\\](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/) \u2014 \\[be quiet!\\](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator) \u2014 \\[MSI\\](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator) \u2014 You can also add all your components into \\[PCPartPicker\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage. \\* Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using.

Freddie's serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 4.20% following the housing bubble and peaked at 3.17% in August 2020 during the pandemic. Fannie Mae reported that the Single-Family serious delinquency rate in May was 0.53%, down from 0.55% in April. The serious delinquency rate is up year-over-year from 0.48% in May 2024, however, this is below the pre-pandemic lows of 0.65%. The Fannie Mae serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 5.59% following the housing bubble and peaked at 3.32% in August 2020 during the pandemic. These are mortgage loans that are \"three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure\". Mortgages in forbearance are being counted as delinquent in this monthly report but are not reported to the credit bureaus. For Fannie, by vintage, for loans made in 2004 or earlier (1% of portfolio), 1.37% are seriously delinquent (down from 1.39% the previous month). For loans made in 2005 through 2008 (1% of portfolio), 1.94% are seriously delinquent (down from 1.98%). For recent loans, originated in 2009 through 2023 (98% of portfolio), 0.49% are seriously delinquent (down from 0.50%). So, Fannie is still working through a handful of poor performing loans from the bubble years. https://www.fanniemae.com/media/55801/display",

In Florida, homeowners are fleeing soaring insurance costs, and in Colorado, investors are culling rental properties.

There\u2019s a saying in investing that you should never try to catch a falling knife. Well, the knife is falling. Sellers both individual and institutional have gotten used to the idea that they can expect a high profit margin on the resale of residential properties. Some are flippers, some are tech bros who moved to Austin or Tampa for their job and now they\u2019re moving again, and some are companies like RedFin. But that gold rush was all based on the presence of motivated buyers who needed to buy, low interest rates which practically amounted to free money, and short supply of available housing. ALL of those variables have shifted in the buyer\u2019s favor to various degrees depending on locale. Austin, Texas used to be one of the hottest markets in the country and now it\u2019s considered frozen. The outlying towns of Greater Austin \u2014 Round Rock, Pflugerville, Leander, Buda, Georgetown \u2014 are seeing a 30% drop in prices and valuations and inventory keeps climbing.

The NIMBYs also have organizations that go around and sue jurisdictions to prevent develop on the grounds of environmental impacts. One could argue that many of the states worst wild fire disasters were caused by jurisdictions using regulation to prevent people from cutting trees (even for fire & safety reasons). NIMBY groups such as the Sierra club are also to blame because they prevent logging on federal forest lands, which increases wildfire intensity and damage. In Sonoma and Monterey counties for example, you can\u2019t cut any \u201cprotected species\u201d over 6\u201d diameter without a permit and paying an exorbitant fee. Also in Monterey county, you can\u2019t even trim limbs with getting a certified arborist to come out to make sure you aren't harming the tree. This gets extremely costly if you have land with a lot of trees (which obviously would happen if the county/city won\u2019t let you cut them down). Other counties won\u2019t let you cut trees at all. That\u2019s all besides the fact that it takes 3+ years in many jurisdictions (& over 100k in permits & impact fees), just to build a single family residence. This is likely a step in the right direction - but there\u2019s a long ways to go in fighting boomers and their death grip on the California housing market. There\u2019s many other regulations that need to be repealed or scaled back to be more reasonable, such as the California green building standards.

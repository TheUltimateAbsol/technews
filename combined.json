I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in having a big backlog of games I want to get through from the Switch 1. I\u2019d love to start knocking it out, but playing some of them with their subpar resolutions on Switch 2 is not ideal. Where is the Witcher 3 patch? Or even Skyrim? What\u2019s most disappointing too is that Nintendo titles themselves aren\u2019t getting new patches. I\u2019d love to replay Fire Emblem Three Houses again but it\u2019s hard to when the game doesn\u2019t look that great docked right now. How about some Xenoblade Chronicles patches? Nintendo took the time to patch New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe, but where the HECK is the Super Mario Wonder Update that game would look amazing with one! Or how about an easy layup to build up hype for Metroid Prime 4; announce a Switch 2 update for Metroid Prime Remaster. That game is BEGGING for a Switch 2 update, it would look so glorious at 4K. Was Nintendo that stingy with Dev Kits that they didn\u2019t even give their internal studios kits? I love my Switch 2 but I really want more patches to take advantage of the extra power.",

Connected to a possible weather system. * Tons of refactoring and heavy documentation occurring within the codebase. Presumably occurs during the late stages of development. Also potentially might hint at mod support day one or close to it. * **RUMOR** - Gabefollower claims HLX (Half Life 3) is already at the stage where some parts of the project is already finished and just needs a bit more polish. Valve developers have been moving around different projects. Usually this means that the original project they were working on is a sinking ship they ran away from but this time around, it might mean that their work isn't needed for HLX anymore. Additionally, HLX might have non-hitscan weapons with bullets that are directly affected by the gravity conditions of an area. In conjunction with the refactoring news, Mcvicker believes that if this were any other company he'd think we were at the final final stages of development but Valve is Valve so yeah.

What's more is that Legacy Kollection on Switch 2 appears to come *komplete on Game Card* with the box art not having the appropriate border and labels that usually denote such releases. This is obviously refreshing to hear for some as these more traditional physical launches have become an increasing rarity among third parties supporting the console, especially based on today's Direct. We should know all the details imminently. A Legacy Kollection Developer Panel is happening at 12PM PT as part of EVO Showcase, where we're probably getting the release date konfirmed as well since it already leaked.",

Economists expected inflation in the personal consumption expenditures index to tick up to 2.5% from the month before. The rise in inflation suggests that the Fed will have to continue working to bring down prices and that inflation could be a lingering problem, even as President Donald Trump pushes for the Fed to cut interest rates. The Fed\u2019s goal is 2% annual inflation. On a month-to-month basis, inflation was 0.3%. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose to 2.8% on an annual basis. Core inflation was 0.3% on a monthly basis. The PCE inflation readings lag the more closely watched consumer price index reports. The latest CPI report showed that inflation rose slightly to 2.7% for June. Overshadowing the inflation reports is the Fed, which once again opted to hold interest rates steady this week despite pressure from Trump to cut. If inflation starts falling more, it could push the Fed to start to cut rates. But if inflation remains too high, it could have the opposite effect. The labor market is still holding up despite the higher interest rates. The economy again beat expectations in June and added 147,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.2%. Also, economic output has been up, according to the most recent reading. U.S. GDP expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Wednesday morning ahead of the Fed decision.",

                "raw_content": "Prices are declining in certain places as the supply of homes for sale outpaces demand, with high costs and economic uncertainty sidelining would-be buyers. The median home-sale price fell in 14 of the 50 most populous U.S. metro areas this week. Oakland, CA saw the biggest drop, with a 6.8% year-over-year decline, followed by two Florida metros and two Texas metros: West Palm Beach (-4.9%), Jacksonville (-3.1%), Austin (-2.9%) and Houston (-2.8%). Prices are falling in several metro areas because the housing market is slow due to high housing costs and economic uncertainty, with homes taking longer to sell than a year ago in every major metro, and more home sellers than buyers in much of the country. In West Palm Beach, for instance, the typical home that went under contract during the four weeks ending July 27 took 93 days to do so, the longest period of all the metros in this analysis and up 18 days from a year earlier. Pending home sales are down 1.4% year over year in West Palm Beach, and supply is up 7.7%. Nationwide, the median sale price rose 2% year over year to just shy of its record high. But that uptick is small compared to the 5% and 6% increases that were common in late 2024 and early 2025, and Redfin economists expect national prices to decline 1% annually by the end of this year. The median U.S. asking price has already lost steam, dipping to its lowest level in five months this week and posting its smallest increase since February (except the prior 4-week period). That signals that more and more sellers are pricing their home lower from the start to meet buyers where they are in terms of price expectations. Monthly mortgage payments have lost steam, too, dipping to a median of $2,671 this week, the lowest level since January. \u201cSellers need to start coming to terms with two things: One, homes are more often going to sit on the market for longer than a week or two before they sell, and two, buyers are gaining the upper hand,\u201d said James Gulden, a Redfin Premier agent in Boston. \u201cI advise my sellers to be realistic about the price they\u2019re going to get based on the market research I provide, while also taking into account which direction the market is moving, especially if they want multiple offers. I\u2019m also reminding sellers to be patient and not panic. Sure, many homes have been selling within a week for the last several years, but that\u2019s not historically normal. They have to reorient themselves to the fact that it may take several weeks, or more, before receiving an acceptable offer.\u201d Pending U.S. home sales are down 1.4% from a year ago, while total inventory is up 8.9%. New listings are stagnant, up 0.6% year over year, as some would-be sellers opt to stay put rather than enter the buyer\u2019s market.",

We put all this in the TRR. The Seller's agent called mine and said we were lying and that \"We don't believe there is mold\". So we put in the cancellation letter. \"No, wait! We said we didnt believe there was mold, we didnt say we wouldnt fix it!\" Sorry, chap. Calling my wife a liar is a no-no for me. Then the seller called my agent directly (which is imo bad form) to apologize and say that he is going through a rough divorce and that he can only do so many fixes and they have to be done after the closing so he can use the money to make the repairs and he really needs the house sold. Big sob story. \\-bear in mind I was already accepting the risk of two HVAC units being 20 and 13 years old, a 15 year old roof in a high hail state, and a really small room for one of my kids, so it wasnt like I was asking for the world to be fixed. just the health and safety concerns. I told my agent that while I sympathize with his plight, it is not my responsibility to bail him out with his divorce, and perhaps he should list the house to be sold \"as-is\" to avoid this the next time, because we are still out. All this to say, yeah. Sellers still think they can get those COVID cash offers in an economy that cannot justify $3500+ mortgage payments for the average family. something has to budge.",

Prices went up 2x-3x and entire new blocks of condos got bought up by investors (short and long term).

                "raw_content": "Key Takeaways: * Multifamily demand remains elevated, with 116,000 units absorbed in Q2 2025 \u2014 the sixth-highest quarterly absorption since 2000. * Supply increased modestly, but the national construction pipeline dropped below 500,000 units for the first time since 2016. * Rent growth slowed to 1.7% annually, the sharpest deceleration since 2023, as property owners prioritized occupancy over pricing. * Construction starts remain muted, with new development hindered by tight credit conditions and economic uncertainty. Robust Demand, Subtle Signs of Cooling Multifamily demand remained strong as the US multifamily sector absorbed over 116,000 units in Q2 2025, bringing year-to-date absorption to 216,000 \u2014 matching the pace of last year\u2019s near-record total. For the second consecutive quarter, demand outpaced new supply, improving the vacancy rate for the first back-to-back quarterly decline since 2021. However, seasonally adjusted data from Cushman & Wakefield shows early signs of softening. Historically, Q2 demand runs 30% higher than Q1; in 2025, it rose by only about half that. Consumer sentiment surveys also declined sharply during the quarter, hinting at potential demand headwinds ahead. Occupancy Over Rent Growth As economic uncertainty grows, multifamily owners have shifted toward maximizing occupancy rather than pushing rents. That approach is reflected in the Q2 rent data \u2014 annual rent growth slowed to 1.7%, a 50 basis point drop from Q1 and the sharpest QOQ deceleration in two years. Rent growth also showed monthly weakness in May and June, coinciding with a surge in new supply and broader concerns about tariffs. While April rents rose 0.22% month-over-month, growth slipped to just 0.03% in June. Still, some metros are outperforming. San Francisco led all US markets with 6.8% YOY rent growth, followed by San Jose and Chicago (both at 4.5%). New York and Northern New Jersey also posted over 3.5% gains \u2014 all ranking among the highest occupancy markets nationwide. Construction Pipeline Hits 8-Year Low The construction pipeline continues to shrink as financing remains tight. With just 3.8% of total multifamily inventory under construction, the market is seeing its lowest development levels since 2016. New starts have slowed to 2012-era levels, and total pipeline volume dropped below 500,000 units \u2014 a 50% reduction from 2023\u2019s peak. Out of all tracked markets, only 11 saw any increase in new starts over the past year, most adding just one or two projects. Major declines were seen in Dallas/Ft. Worth (-22,000 units), New York (-18,000), and Austin (-18,000), with Phoenix, Atlanta, and Houston also seeing notable pullbacks. Why It Matters With multifamily demand still outpacing supply but rent growth softening, the US multifamily sector is entering a more cautious phase. Developers face financing constraints, consumers are growing wary, and rent strategies are shifting \u2014 all pointing to a market that is healthy, but increasingly defensive. As the pipeline continues to contract and construction delays persist, a tighter supply landscape could provide support for fundamentals heading into 2026 \u2014 assuming demand remains resilient. What\u2019s Next Watch for how sustained economic uncertainty, interest rates, and consumer confidence impact multifamily absorption in the second half of 2025. **With less new inventory on the horizon, markets with strong occupancy and limited supply could see upward pressure on rents in 2026.**",

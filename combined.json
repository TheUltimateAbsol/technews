I understand that people have different tastes, but Nintendo knows where the people who are willing to show up and spend their money are. A big system seller this early of the year would be huge for Nintendo. This is something that the Switch 1 did not have in 2018 because the system sellers came out in the holiday of 2018 for the Switch 1.

There are fairly consistent dropped frames and widely variable frame rates. I feel like DF and other outlets kind of glossed over it. I was totally expecting after watching reviews for performance hits during heavy action sequences, but they made it sound pretty few and far between. I am a few hours into the game now and there are a fair bit of issues during Grace\u2019s slower sections too. Sometimes just navigating around you will get some slowdowns and dropped frames. Without any spoilers, pretty early game there is a back stairwell in one of the first areas that just chugs when you are walking up and down the stairs. Really weird as there is not really anything going on or any heavy effects. Hoping there will still be some minor patching from Capcom to clean a bit of this up. Still an amazing feat on this little device, but I think being totally transparent about performance issues being a bit more prevalent than suggested is appropriate. If I would have known that there would be issues in pretty typical gameplay additional sections, I probably would have held off for some additional performance patches. Again, all coming from a handheld only player perspective",

He further states that the custom model is deployed directly onto a **\"classified cloud.\"** https://youtu.be/MPTNHrq_4LU?si=2gVRoGCAC7msi30C Classified networks are air-gapped. The model is running on **dedicated infrastructure** where you can allocate **100% of available compute to inference for a single customer**-not splitting capacity across hundreds of millions of users. In the same interview, he emphasizes that the computation going into these models **doubles every four months.** These companies are *always* at least 1 generation ahead of what they've released to the public. Sometimes they're even **2 generations ahead.** We have proof of this from OpenAI. > (IMO gold model announced in July 2025 -still unreleased to consumers 8 months later; First Proof research-grade solver from Feb 2026-nowhere near release.) **Stop thinking about the Pentagon-Anthropic dispute in terms of the Claude you know.** The military is almost certainly running a custom model **generations ahead** of public releases, with maximum compute and classified, sensitive-information-rich training data. You don't threaten a **Defense Production Act invocation** -a tool designed for *wartime industrial mobilization* -over a glorified chatbot. The government's insane overreaction - **first-ever supply chain risk designation of a US company** -makes no sense *unless what they're dealing with is unprecedented capability.* We know that **Claude was integral to Maduro's capture.** Here is most likely what this custom model is capable of: - **Autonomous strategic reasoning** -not just answering questions but independently analyzing complex geopolitical scenarios, war-gaming at superhuman speed, identifying non-obvious patterns across classified intelligence streams - **Real-time synthesis across massive classified datasets** that previously required entire analyst teams and *weeks* of work - **Chain-of-thought reasoning chains that are orders of magnitude longer** than anything consumers see Given all this, Pentagon Claude is likely a custom maximum compute version of Claude Opus 5 or even 5.5.",

Another matter of fact is that weapons for killing people are already being used by people, and they make (intentional?) mistakes all the time.

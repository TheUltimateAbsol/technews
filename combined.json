Here in Minnesota the number of people getting help in assisted living facilities is up double the growth of other programs. But here's the kicker, the rate of payment in this assisted living space is 10 to 15 times the growth in other programs. We pulled the data on assisted living facilities in the Minneapolis area. Minneapolis, as you might expect, has a lot. 169. - St. Paul, with a population of 307,000, has 83 - Brooklyn Center, 30,000 population, has 106 - Brooklyn Park, population of 84,000, has 181, more than Minneapolis a city five times its size. But this assisted living facility puts this all in perspective. It's owned by a man indicted for laundering a million dollars in the Feeding Our Future scam.\u201d \u201cThese assisted living facilities received over $2.3 million in state money last year alone. A Minnesota Reformer article says he has been paid a whopping $49 million since 2016.\u201d",

Bring Nintendo Switch 2 consoles together to allow up to four players to participate.\" Furthermore, they discovered 'Tempered Gogmazios' in the text strings, suggesting that this monster might be included in the upcoming high-difficulty quest updates. \u200bFinally, [Image 3](https://ibb.co/F4tyfLRT) shows the Switch 2 presets they loaded on a PC (note: this does not represent the final performance).

                "raw_content": "non-paywall: https://archive.ph/6NMkx Mortgage rates have reached their lowest point for the year, potentially injecting fresh momentum into a US homebuying market that spent much of 2025 in the doldrums. The average for 30-year, fixed loans dropped to 6.15% this week, data from Freddie Mac showed Wednesday. That\u2019s down from around 7% in January and \u201can encouraging sign for potential homebuyers heading into the new year,\u201d said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist. Many industry watchers are upbeat. In general, homes are expected to get cheaper in real terms: Wage growth is poised to far outpace gains in prices. That would put purchases in closer reach of more Americans, even if mortgage rates don\u2019t come down much further. Determined buyers may not need much more encouragement to act on pent-up demand. A measure of contracts to buy resale homes has climbed for four straight months and in November reached its highest point since early 2023, the National Association of Realtors reported this week. That has helped the market \u201cto pick up steam through what is traditionally the slowest part of the year,\u201d said Joel Berner, senior economist for Realtor.com. \u201cIf this momentum continues into the peak buying season of 2026, we could see much stronger sales figures than we saw for much of 2025.\u201d There\u2019s little argument that affordability kept many prospective buyers on the sidelines this year. And housing remains too expensive for many people. While prices have long since cooled from the pandemic-era frenzy, they are still rising, especially in places where listings remain in short supply. Many would-be sellers have been holding out as well, as still-elevated rates offer them little incentive to give up the cheap loans they landed a few years ago and move. In recent months, some have pulled their listings to wait for a more opportune time. If the market does turn around next year, it will be off a very low base. Completed purchases of previously owned homes have approached 30-year lows in 2023, 2024 and 2025. Even with a 6.3% increase in 2026, the median of the predictions collected by Bloomberg earlier this month, sales would still have a long way to go before they reach pre-pandemic levels. The most optimistic projections are based on the labor market holding up \u2014 always a wild card. A wave of layoffs sparked by artificial intelligence, for example, would especially hit younger workers and undermine the housing recovery, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. As for mortgage rates, little movement is expected for the foreseeable future. And the Federal Reserve, which cut its benchmark rate three times in 2025, has hinted at just one or two cuts for 2026.",

        "text_content": "# Welcome to the 10th annual Singularity Predictions at [r/Singularity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Singularity/). In this yearly thread, we have reflected for a decade now on our previously held estimates for AGI, ASI, and the Singularity, and updated them with new predictions for the year to come. \"As we step out of 2025 and into 2026, it\u2019s worth pausing to notice how the conversation itself has changed. A few years ago, we argued about whether generative AI was \u201creal\u201d progress or just clever mimicry. This year, the debate shifted toward something more grounded: not*can it speak*, but *can it do*\u2014plan, iterate, use tools, coordinate across tasks, and deliver outcomes that actually hold up outside a demo. In 2025, the standout theme was **integration**. AI models didn\u2019t just get better in isolation; they got woven into workflows\u2014research, coding, design, customer support, education, and operations. \u201cCopilots\u201d matured from novelty helpers into systems that can draft, analyze, refactor, test, and sometimes even execute. That practical shift matters, because real-world impact comes less from raw capability and more from how cheaply and reliably capability can be applied. We also saw the continued convergence of modalities: text, images, audio, video, and structured data blending into more fluid interfaces. The result is that AI feels less like a chatbot and more like a layer\u2014something that sits between intention and execution. But this brought a familiar tension: capability is accelerating, while reliability remains uneven. The best systems feel startlingly competent; the average experience still includes brittle failures, confident errors, and the occasional \u201cagent\u201d that wanders off into the weeds. Outside the screen, the physical world kept inching toward autonomy. Robotics and self-driving didn\u2019t suddenly \u201csolve themselves,\u201d but the trajectory is clear: more pilots, more deployments, more iteration loops, more public scrutiny. The arc looks less like a single breakthrough and more like relentless engineering\u2014safety cases, regulation, incremental expansions, and the slow process of earning trust. Creativity continued to blur in 2025, too. We\u2019re past the stage where AI-generated media is surprising; now the question is what it does to culture when *most* content can be generated cheaply, quickly, and convincingly. The line between human craft and machine-assisted production grows more porous each year\u2014and with it comes the harder question: what do we value when abundance is no longer scarce? And then there\u2019s governance. 2025 made it obvious that the constraints around AI won\u2019t come only from what\u2019s technically possible, but from what\u2019s socially tolerated. Regulation, corporate policy, audits, watermarking debates, safety standards, and public backlash are becoming part of the innovation cycle. The Singularity conversation can\u2019t just be about \u201cwhat\u2019s next,\u201d but also \u201cwhat\u2019s allowed,\u201d \u201cwhat\u2019s safe,\u201d and \u201cwho benefits.\u201d So, for 2026: do agents become genuinely dependable coworkers, or do they remain powerful-but-temperamental tools? Do we get meaningful leaps in reasoning and long-horizon planning, or mostly better packaging and broader deployment? Does open access keep pace with frontier development, or does capability concentrate further behind closed doors? And what is the first domain where society collectively says, \u201cOkay\u2014this changes the rules\u201d? As always, make bold predictions, but define your terms. Point to evidence. Share what would change your mind.

AI starts contributing to its own research. Native multimodality matures, humanoid robots enter workforce (warehouses, early adopters). Expect GPT-5.5+, Gemini 3.5/4, Claude 5, etc. Key milestones: FrontierMath T4 60%, AGIDefinition 65%, half work day task horizons. **2027:** AI becomes national security priority; US-China race heats up across energy, chips, and research. Internally, automated coders emerge and automated research labs scale massively (1e28 FLOP training runs on 1+ GW data centers). OpenAI IPO \\~$2T. Bubble maybe pops but governments bail out to stay competitive. Public models hit AGIDefinition 85%, Remote Labor Index 50%, \\~1 work month task horizons. **Bottom line:** Recursive self-improvement accelerates behind closed doors while the public sees steady capability gains and the geopolitical stakes explode.

I've gone a long way since my first predictions which look sloppy in retrospect. I've gotten a much clearer and in-depth understanding since then, with this work being influenced by that of Aschenbrenner's [Situational Awareness](https://situational-awareness.ai/) and Kokotajlo et al.'s [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) minus some of the doomerism. I am no expert forecaster by any means and you shouldn't be relying on my specific predictions, but you can almost certainly rely on some of the sources I will attempt to cite (EpochAI my love) and the general direction of the narrative I will present. This is my personal spin on the upcoming events: it's a mix of grounded analysis and optimistic idealism, with emphasis on the latter. Just to quickly comment on my 2025 prediction, I believe that most of my broad commentary and intuition were right. Unfortunately, I found that I gave much more optimistic technical predictions that were mostly delayed and never came this year. But I think my biggest hit of that year is the IMO prediction, but given AlphaProof already having attained silver the previous year my prediction may be rightly seen as low-hanging fruit. I've also pushed back my AGI prediction and dropped DeepMind's definition given the tremendous difficulty to evaluate those exact standards. Over the course of the year, I've moved away from the nebulous *AGI* term towards more precise terms like Automated coders, Superhuman AI researchers etc. as defined in the AI futures model. However, I still retain a prediction on my flair that is subject to arbitrary definitions and proxies for measurement; My current definition for AGI places its public release by 2028, even if it won't be acknowledged as such. In short, I anchor more on the predicted timelines for AC than I do for AGI. I've split my prediction into the next two years which is further split into two parts each in this thread (blame Reddit comment limits). Should you wish to discuss further, I'd be happy to engage with whatever praise or pushback I'll be getting.",

However, other AI deep research tools failed to pick up these connections, so I am skeptical that this is the full explanation for the above events. >My theory is that the AI tools are now becoming capable enough to pick off the lowest hanging fruit amongst the problems listed as open in the Erdos problem database, where by \"lowest hanging\" I mean \"amenable to simple proofs using fairly standard techniques\". However, that category is also precisely the category of nominally open problems that are most likely to have been solved in the literature, perhaps without much fanfare due to the simple nature of the arguments. This may already explain much of the strong correlation above between AI-solvability and being already proven in some obscure portion of the literature. >This correlation is likely to continue in the near term, particularly for problems attacked purely by AI tools without significant expert supervision. Nevertheless, the amount of progress in capability of these tools is non-trivial, and bodes well for the ability of such tools to automatically scan through the \"long tail\" of underexamined problems in the mathematical literature.",

It worked, but that thing is a mile long. There was a proposal in China to build a full-sized synchrotron, maybe half a mile around. Too expensive. There was a startup making a \"desktop synchrotron\". They went bust. Unclear why. Direct-writing with electron beams works fine; that's how masks are made. But it's too slow for IC production.

Honestly I think a lot of hardware enthusiasts (from a range of backgrounds) would be rather envious if they could see what is so ready available, abundant, and affordable in a country where most of it is ostensibly restricted according to export controls. Just for example, I can go on Taobao right now and see full-fat 5090s and 4090s widely available - you can choose different VRAM capacities, cooler styles (including two-slot blower designs or AIO water cooled variants). There's also plenty of D-variants and older generation cards if you've got a strict budget and they fit your use-case. They often come with warranty, and they'll test the cards thoroughly (e.g. with gpu\\_burn). There are lively discussion boards and forums where people test and benchmark the cards for all sorts of esoteric use-cases, and recommend reputable sellers. There are also so many creative solutions for installing such hardware, with custom rackmount cases (and racks are extremely affordable), PCIe backboards and risers, solutions for multi-slot cards, SMX to PCIe adapters. All of it is easy to get hold of by individuals, and appropriately affordable. I'll add that this also applies to entire platforms, with server-grade CPUs, motherboards, and RAM being extremely affordable, especially given that you can get hold of qualification samples so easily. I once heard it put that American consumers were long envied by the Chinese for what they could so readily get in the US, but which was unattainable in China. One can't help but sense that the wind is starting to blow in the opposite direction.",

Also just seeing how much Nintendo cooked with this game just makes me even more excited to see what they do with the next zelda game. Dk graphics are really good far better than any switch 1 game and I loved how zelda botw and totk looked on switch 1 and now we got a lot more power.

Last year, single-family starts finished the year up 6.6% in 2024, ending a two-year decline and keeping homebuilding above the pre-pandemic pace. * Attached, single-family construction \u2014 condos and townhomes \u2014 increased at twice the rate of detached, single-family homebuilding. Single-family permitting fell 6.3% in the first half of 2025, signaling a slowdown after a year of rebound. Markets like Jacksonville, San Antonio, and Boston led the retreat in permits, with each seeing double-digit percentage declines compared to the same period in 2024. Affordability remains a major challenge, especially for first-time buyers, despite slightly lower mortgage rates. Buyers are gaining leverage but sales volumes are sluggish and inventories are rising across much of the country. Existing home inventory is now at a six-year high and exceeds pre-pandemic levels in many markets, forcing builders to increase incentives and reduce prices to maintain sales. While permitting activity in 2025 remains 16% above pre-pandemic levels, it\u2019s a step down from 2024\u2019s momentum, reflecting shifting builder sentiment. Notably, more than half of the 50 largest metros are still permitting more homes than their pre-2020 average, but overall momentum is clearly weakening. Markets with the largest declines in permitting activity Among the largest 50 metros, Jacksonville, San Antonio, Boston, Denver and St. Louis have seen the largest pullback in total single-family permits issued in the first six months of the year, compared to last year. Some markets are still gaining Among the largest 50 metros, Kansas City, Orlando, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and Oklahoma City have seen the largest increase in total single-family permits issued in the first six months of the year, compared to last year. Permitting activity is 16% above pre-pandemic levels but down from 2024 Difference in total single-family permits issued in January 2024 - June 2024 and January 2025- June 2025 2024: A Rebound Year for Homebuilding Homebuilding rebounded in 2024 after two years in decline, driven by builder optimism, easing mortgage rates, low resale inventory and a 4.7 million-unit housing deficit to address. In response to the ongoing housing affordability crisis, builders doubled down on their pivot toward more affordable and more dense housing types. Single-family starts rose 6.6%, while condo and townhome construction surged 10.7%, more than twice the growth rate of detached homes. This expands on a trend that began in 2022 and continued in 2023. As the cost of space increased, lot size and home size shrank The average size of new single-family homes shrank to 2,100 square feet, down 100 square feet from the year prior and 200 below the pre-pandemic average. Lot sizes declined even faster to 6,300 square feet, now 1,100 square feet smaller than in 2019. Builder confidence was buoyed by limited resale inventory, mortgage rates falling from their 2023 highs, and an incentives strategy that kept new home sales rising. Long-Term Affordability Tied to Underbuilding Persistent underbuilding in expensive markets continues to erode affordability. Metro areas with high price-to-income ratios, such as San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, consistently permit fewer homes per capita than other regions. In the past 12 months, metros with price-to-income ratios one standard deviation above the national average issued less than half as many permits per capita on average as their peers, locking in long-term affordability challenges. Policy Solutions: Unlocking More Supply Builders can only respond to demand where regulations allow. While geographic constraints can play an important role, zoning and permitting policies restrict housing growth in many cities. Tackling the housing deficit will require structural reforms: * Zone for more density: Allow multifamily, middle housing, and higher-density development. * Relax parking mandates: Lower costs and expand buildable area. * Streamline approvals: Reduce permitting delays. * Fund affordability: Expand trust funds to support affordable development.",

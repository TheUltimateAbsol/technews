The suit, filed in the Southern District of Florida Federal Court, was filed in a personal capacity and names BBC and BBC studios productions as defendants. The documentary omitted Trump urging his supporters to protest \"peacefully\" and instead spliced two separate comments made nearly an hour apart, making him appear he was calling for violence. \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And I'll be there with you. And we fight \u2014 we fight like hell,\" the documentary showed Trump saying. In reality, Trump said, \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\" It wasn't until 54 minutes later that Trump called on his supporters to \"fight like hell\" for election integrity.

The government-backed housing-finance giants increased their retained portfolios \u2014 the portion of bonds and loans they hold onto rather than sell to investors \u2014 by more than 25% in the five months through October, according to the latest figures. That\u2019s lifted their combined positions to $234 billion, the most since 2021. Analysts estimate they could add as much as $100 billion more next year. While Trump administration officials have remained tight-lipped on the MBS purchases, they\u2019ve stated repeatedly this year that they would leverage the financial might of Fannie and Freddie to bring housing costs down. Policymakers have also been laying the groundwork to return the companies to public markets nearly two decades after they were placed into conservatorship, and a larger retained portfolio would likely bolster earnings and strengthen their appeal to investors in any future offering. For now, though, the impact is mostly being felt in the $9 trillion US agency MBS market. As the government-sponsored enterprises snap up more and more bonds, they\u2019re curbing the flow of the securities into the market and supporting prices. Moreover, having two large buyers step in when spreads widen could also dampen volatility and, in the process, alter how investors evaluate risk. \u201c**If you want to lower mortgage rates, one of the most direct ways to do so is simply directing the GSEs to purchase more mortgage bonds**,\u201d said Vitaliy Liberman, a portfolio manager at DoubleLine Capital. \u201cThis administration is looking at everything.\u201d Representatives for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees both companies, didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment. Long used as a short-term pipeline for loans awaiting securitization, the retained portfolios ballooned in the 1990s and 2000s as the firms increasingly used them to juice earnings by borrowing cheaply and investing in higher-yielding mortgage bonds. By 2008, their combined holdings swelled to more than $1.5 trillion, and the portfolios had become Fannie and Freddie\u2019s primary profit engines. They weren\u2019t limited to safer agency paper, either. The companies also loaded up on private-label bonds and other assets that proved far riskier than expected. When the housing market buckled during the financial crisis, those positions \u2014 and the leverage behind them \u2014 delivered heavy losses that helped push Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship. In the aftermath, the Treasury forced the pair to unload assets and imposed strict caps on how much they could hold. By late 2022, their retained portfolios had shrunk to just $158 billion. But now, assets are climbing again, rising more than $50 billion in the five months through October. Even after the jump, the firms remain more than $200 billion below their cap, leaving ample room for further growth. The pickup has caught the attention of analysts, who say that with officials offering little explanation, Wall Street is left to speculate about what\u2019s driving the shift \u2014 and how much the GSEs might add next year. **Lower Mortgage Rates** One line of thinking is that the buildup is aimed at nudging mortgage rates down. By keeping more loans on their books instead of selling them into the market, the GSEs shrink the supply of MBS available to investors, a shift that can compress yields and, in turn, lower lending rates. The expansion is unfolding as the Trump administration ramps up its focus on housing affordability. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in September that the president may declare a \u201cnational housing emergency.\u201d More recently, FHFA head Bill Pulte said the agency was exploring the creation of a 50-year mortgage to ease monthly payments, while President Donald Trump urged Fannie and Freddie in a social media post to \u201cget big homebuilders going.\u201d Despite the administration\u2019s push, mortgage rates have remained stubbornly high since 2022, when the Federal Reserve began hiking its target rate to stave off inflation. Even after 1.75 percentage point of rate cuts since 2024, the average 30-year home loan rate is still above 6%. Citigroup Inc. forecasts that Fannie and Freddie will boost their combined retained portfolios by roughly $100 billion in 2026, with an outside chance the increase could reach $250 billion. Such growth, the bank estimates, could compress MBS risk premiums by about 0.25 percentage point, with some or all of that passing through to the rates consumers pay on mortgages. \u201cSince Fannie and Freddie are still substantially owned by the Treasury, the administration still has a great deal of influence over them,\u201d said Walt Schmidt, a strategist at FHN Financial. \u201cIt gives them a flexible tool to lower interest rates for consumers, similar to the Federal Reserve,\u201d which since 2022 has been allowing its own mortgage-bond holdings to roll off its balance sheet. Expanding their retained portfolios could also help set the stage for a public offering, market watchers say. More MBS on the balance sheet means more interest income, and potentially higher profits, at a time when doubts about the GSEs\u2019 earnings power relative to their debt remain a hurdle to any share sale. The Trump administration has already begun laying the groundwork, including informal outreach to investment banks about a potential offering. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said earlier this month that IPOs for the two companies are coming \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re going to put them outside conservatorship and make them profit-seeking entities, then this would be a starting point,\u201d said Jason Callan, co-head of structured assets at Columbia Threadneedle. \u201cInvestors in an IPO are only going to be interested in owning shares of Fannie and Freddie if they can show earnings growth.\u201d MBS Tailwind Regardless of the motivation, analysts say a new source of demand in the MBS market could shift the delicate balance that determines bond prices and yields. Larger retained portfolios could push down risk premiums and dampen day-to-day volatility, altering market dynamics investors have become accustomed to. The GSEs could also reemerge as a central force in the market. Over the past three years, attention was focused on money managers, who became the marginal buyers after the Fed scaled back MBS purchases. If Fannie and Freddie keep growing their holdings, that could change. \u201cIf the ramp-up in the GSEs\u2019 portfolios continues, they would become one of the most important buyers in the market, and that would force investors to pay very close attention to their every move,\u201d said Mario Ichaso, a strategist at Wells Fargo & Co. \u201cThe mantra becomes, \u2018Don\u2019t fight the GSEs.\u2019\u201d For more debt-market coverage, subscribe to the Credit Weekly Even modest portfolio growth could revive long-running debates over how much risk the companies should take on, and whether expanding their holdings puts them on a path toward ever-larger balance sheets. \u201cThere would be huge political concern if Fannie and Freddie began building up their portfolios back toward pre-2008 levels,\u201d said Jeana Curro, a strategist at Bank of America Corp. \u201cTighter underwriting has made mortgage bonds safer than they used to be but still, we expect there would need to be strict regulation if they added significantly.\u201d Few expect a return to the pre-crisis playbook, when the companies\u2019 massive portfolios drew scrutiny for distorting markets and masking risks. But investors say today\u2019s policy backdrop makes at least some additional portfolio expansion likely. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an administration that\u2019s more focused on growth, and getting housing policy wins is paramount,\u201d said Brian Simon, a managing director at alternative credit investment firm Balbec Capital. \u201cBuying more mortgage bonds to help drive down rates and achieve other objectives \u2014 even though we have yet to see that materialize \u2014 could be very much on the table.\u201d",

        "text_content": "We knew **Disney** signed a massive deal with OpenAI, but we are finally seeing how they are using it **internally.** According to a new report from **Business Insider,** Disney has **two** major projects running: 1. **\"DisneyGPT\" (The Chatbot):** As seen in the image(interface), it\u2019s a **custom** wrapper (\"Hey Mickey!\") that connects to their internal data. **The Vibe:** It\u2019s designed to be **\"enchanting,\"** offering quotes from Walt Disney and categorized prompts for employees (Legal, Creative, etc.). **2. \"JARVIS\" (The Agent):** This is the big one. They are developing a separate **\"Agentic\"** tool named after Iron Man\u2019s AI. Unlike DisneyGPT (which just chats), JARVIS is designed to **execute complex workflows** autonomously. This confirms that the **$1 Billion OpenAI investment** wasn't just for \"Sora\" videos. Disney is fundamentally re-architecting its internal workflow around Agentic AI. **If Disney is building \"JARVIS\" for employees, how long until we get a consumer version of a Disney Agent that plans our entire vacation?** **Source: Business Insider** \ud83d\udd17: https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-ai-strategy-employees-disneygpt-openai-deal-chatgpt-2025-12",

A model can score perfectly on ZeroBench but still fumble basic context retention or give you worse outputs than the previous version. What's interesting is people are starting to auto-grade AI predictions retroactively to see which models were actually right over time https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/auto-grade-hn/. That kind of long-term evaluation matters way more than synthetic benchmarks, but it's harder to market. This was in my last newsletter issue (https://hackernewsai.com/). The benchmark-to-reality gap is widening as models get optimized for tests instead of actual use.",

Releasing a **\"Mini\"** version implies they have successfully distilled the audio capabilities into a smaller, cheaper model.

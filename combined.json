        "score": 106,
        "text_content": "Hey everyone, With the launch of the new iPad Pro and \"Ultra Retina XDR\" displays, I've seen a lot of discussion about the visual performance of **Tandem OLED**. But as a chemical engineer working directly in the display materials supply chain, I wanted to share a behind-the-scenes look at why manufacturing these panels is such a nightmare right now\u2014specifically regarding the **Charge Generation Layer (CGL)**. **The Engineering Challenge: It's a \"Double-Decker Bus\"** For those who don't know, Tandem OLED essentially stacks two organic emissive units vertically to double the brightness (1000+ nits) and extend lifespan without burning out the pixels. The problem is the layer *between* them. The CGL has to act as an \"electrical adapter\"\u2014generating electrons for the top unit and holes for the bottom unit simultaneously. * If the CGL is too thick? Voltage drops, and the battery drains fast. * If the CGL is too thin? You get optical interference and the colors look wrong. * If the material isn't pure enough? The whole stack delaminates. **The Supply Chain Gap** Here is the reality on the ground: While panel manufacturers (especially in China) are aggressively expanding capacity for these screens, the supply chain for the actual *chemicals* inside is surprisingly fragile. From what I\u2019m seeing in the industry, most domestic suppliers are still in early R&D or have paused development entirely because the qualification standards are insane. You essentially need semiconductor-grade purity for a chemical layer that is only nanometers thick. **Why \"Just Scaling It Up\" Doesn't Work** I'm currently involved in a project trying to localize this supply, and the biggest hurdle isn't the chemistry itself\u2014it's the **batch-to-batch consistency**. In the lab, making 10 grams of perfect CGL material is easy. Making 100 kg that behaves *exactly* the same way is incredibly hard. We have to lean heavily on **APC (Advanced Process Control)** and **MES (Manufacturing Execution System)** data just to track variables. A temperature fluctuation of 0.5 degrees during synthesis can ruin an entire batch that's meant for flagship devices. **The Qualification Timeline** Just to give you an idea of how slow this industry moves: 1. **Sampling:** We send spec-compliant samples. (Months) 2. **Co-testing:** The panel maker runs small batches. (More months) 3. **Pilot:** Moving to production-scale equipment. 4. **Commercial:** Finally shipping volume. The whole cycle can take 2-3 years. It\u2019s a slow, painful grind, but it\u2019s the only way to get these high-end displays into more devices (like future laptops and maybe even automotive screens) without them costing a fortune. Happy to answer any questions about the chemical engineering side of OLEDs or what the manufacturing floor actually looks like!

I no longer like videogames with stories and which require you to sit down and play the game for hours to get any progress done. I've embraced more of the casual gaming where I would only game once or twice a week if that, for like 30 - 60 mins. So I love my Switch 2 because it is very flexible in that regard. I've bought Hades, Inscryptian, Balatro and Ball X Pit. I absolutely love these games as they are very convenient where I can just pick them up and play for like 20 mins. Drop them and not think about them again. No story to keep up with. I also really liked Ape Out, and thinking about maybe getting Disc Room. Are there any other games which fit the ball? It will obviously be Indie games as I feel they are the games that cater more to short session, arcadey type games. Thanks.",

That would equal about 5% to 10% of its total workforce of roughly 220,000 employees.* >*The cuts are expected to take place in the third week of January.* ***Reports from workers point to Azure cloud teams, the Xbox gaming unit, and global sales as key areas of focus.*** *So far, Microsoft has not confirmed the plan. This move would follow a difficult 2025. During that year, Microsoft cut more than 15,000 jobs across several rounds. Those actions came even as revenue and profit stayed strong.* >***AI Focus Drives Cost Shifts*** >*At the same time, Microsoft is spending heavily on AI systems. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026 alone, capital spending reached $34.9 billion. The company expects total spending for the year to pass $80 billion, which would be higher than fiscal 2025.* >*Most of that money is going toward data centers, chips, and AI tools. Due to this shift, analysts believe Microsoft is moving funds away from payroll and into long-term tech assets. As a result, middle managers and older product teams may face a higher risk.* >*Meanwhile, roles tied to AI research and core cloud work are seen as more stable. This reflects the company's goal to stay competitive in AI development.* [https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-msft-eyes-major-january-layoffs-as-ai-costs-rise](https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-msft-eyes-major-january-layoffs-as-ai-costs-rise)",

                "raw_content": "A new analysis from the Realtor.com economic research team considers what it would take to restore home affordability to 2019 levels, when the typical mortgage payment was about 21% of the median household income, compared with more than 30% today. The analysis finds it would take: - Mortgage rates falling to 2.65%, down from 6.15% currently, or - Incomes rising 56% to a median of $132,171, up from $84,763 currently, or - Home prices falling 35% to a median of $273,000, down from $418,000 last year. None of these outcomes are likely or expected in 2026. But the figures underscore the challenge of restoring the housing market to the relatively affordable conditions of 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic brought severe disruptions. Of course, some combination of these three factors could also achieve the same result in affordability\u2014although the combinations required to fix the affordability crisis are also unlikely in the near term. For example, if mortgage rates dropped to 4%, while concurrently incomes rose 10% and home prices dropped 9%, mortgage payments would equal 21% of income. That scenario is unlikely, in part because soaring incomes and falling rates would likely drive home prices up quickly. On the other hand, if mortgage rates hold steady at 6%, and wages and home prices continue to grow at their 2025 pace, the market would not return to pre-pandemic affordability until 2047, 21 years from now. \"Taken together, the figures suggest that affordability constraints today are less about home prices alone and more about the interaction between prices and elevated borrowing costs,\" says Realtor.com senior economic research analyst Hannah Jones. Jones says that unless mortgage rates, incomes, or home prices change by a sizable and unusual amount, \"affordability is likely to remain historically strained, reinforcing the lock-in effect for existing homeowners and keeping entry barriers high for first-time buyers.\" In addition to mortgage payments, homebuyers have to budget for the cost of taxes, insurance, and utilities, which have all risen in recent years. Including those costs on top of a mortgage payment that is 21% of income brings the typical total cost of homeownership to just around 30% of income, which is the threshold for affordability defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The affordability gains that are actually expected in 2026 In reality, the Realtor.com economic research team forecasts that mortgage rates will average around 6.3% this year, while household incomes will rise 3.6% and home prices will grow by 2.2%. Those trends would push the typical mortgage payment down slightly to around 29% of median income, which would mark the first move below 30% since 2022. That would mark a modest improvement in affordability conditions. But the typical homebuyer would still expect to budget well above 30% of their income for homeownership costs, after adding taxes, insurance, and utilities to their mortgage payment costs. To address the affordability crisis, Trump has focused heavily on lower mortgage rates. He recently admitted that he didn't want to allow home prices to fall, lest existing homeowners suffer a loss of equity. The new analysis shows that to regain 2019 levels of affordability with mortgage rates alone, rates would have to fall to 2.65%. That would matching the all-time low for mortgage rates reached on Jan. 7, 2021, when the federal funds rate was at zero and 10-year Treasury notes paid a paltry 1% interest. On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump repeatedly promised to bring mortgage rates back down to 3% or lower. In reality, achieving rates that low would likely require a severe recession with massive job losses and soaring unemployment. That's because mortgage rates, and other long-term interest rates, are set by the free market, and are not under the direct control of the president or even the Federal Reserve. While the Fed has been cutting its short-term interest rate, and Trump will soon appoint a new Fed chair in favor of further cuts, the Fed's policies typically influence mortgage rates only loosely and indirectly. In theory, the Fed could drive mortgage rates lower by buying up trillions in mortgage-backed securities, but making such a move outside of a time of economic crisis would be an unprecedented step. \"Any action specifically targeting mortgage rates is well outside of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and full employment, so I would not expect the Fed to take this on in 2026, even with a new chair,\" says Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel. \"High rates have been a pain for the housing market, but that has not triggered any macro crisis worthy of Fed intervention.\" Krimmel also notes that if policymakers did manage to force mortgage rates to ultra-low levels, it would probably just send home prices soaring again, similar to what happened during the pandemic crisis. Ultimately, most economists believe the solution to the affordability crisis lies in expanding housing supply through more construction, especially in markets where supply is tightest. \"Hypothetically, if the Fed magically forced mortgage rates to 3% overnight that could risk some serious economic overheating,\" says Krimmel. \"You don't really solve an affordability crisis by subsidizing demand through artificially cheap financing.\"",

Traditional economic theory assumed constraints that simply do not exist in a world of unlimited QE and constant intervention. Even today\u2019s so-called high interest rates still function like stimulus when you look at how much liquidity is already in the system. There is just too much money sloshing around globally. Raising wages across the board does not solve this. Paying someone $100 an hour at McDonald\u2019s does not create real prosperity. It just raises the base cost of everything and pushes prices even further out of reach. You end up treating a monetary distortion with more monetary distortion. Look at Europe. Housing there, while not cheap, has not detached from incomes in the same extreme way it has in the U.S. Meanwhile in America you have celebrities getting $15 million per film and executives pulling absurd compensation packages. Money starts to feel cheap, distorted, and disconnected from actual productivity. At some point, if nothing is allowed to correct, prices stop meaning anything at all.",

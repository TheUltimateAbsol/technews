Uncertain points: - GB100 has never been officially confirmed, but there is at least a clear indication that this code name exists. - GB102 exists as a code name only in the rumor mill; so far, there has been no mention of it by nVidia. - Whether 160 SM is really the maximum hardware for GB100 is currently known only to nVidia. &nbsp; &nbsp;|Chip|**&#8594;**|Dual-chip|**&#8594;**|Product |:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| Blackwell|GB102, 80 SM, 4096-bit HBM3e, 104 billion transistors, ~800mm\u00b2 die-size|**&#8594;**|GB100 (2x GB102), 160 SM, 8192-bit HBM3e, 208 billion transistors, ~1600mm\u00b2 die-size|**&#8594;**|GB200 (4x GB102), 288 SM, 16384-bit HBM3e, 416 billion transistors, ~3200mm\u00b2 die-size (+ \"Grace\" CPU & NVLink-Switch) Blackwell Ultra|GB102, 80 SM, 4096-bit HBM3e, 104 billion transistors, ~800mm\u00b2 die-size|**&#8594;**|GB100U (2x GB102), 160 SM, 8192-bit HBM3e, 208 billion transistors, ~1600mm\u00b2 die-size|**&#8594;**|GB300 (4x GB102), 320 SM, 16384-bit HBM3e, 416 billion transistors, ~3200mm\u00b2 die-size (+ \"Grace\" CPU & NVLink-Switch) nVidia naming|-|&nbsp;|\"**one GPU**\"|&nbsp;|\"**Superchip**\" &nbsp; Unfortunately, nVidia itself sometimes only provides data for a single GPU, even though it is actually referring to the GB200/GB300 \"superchips\". For example, the \"Blackwell Architecture Technical Brief\" ([PDF](https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-blackwell-architecture/blackwell-architecture-technical-brief)) specifies 15/20 petaFLOPS FP4 as the computing power for \"GB300\" and 8 TB/s as the bandwidth. However, according to the [nVidia blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/inside-nvidia-blackwell-ultra-the-chip-powering-the-ai-factory-era/), these are clearly the specifications for a single GB100 GPU. The (correct) data for GB300 with two GB100 GPUs is also noted there: 30/40 petaFLOPS FP4 computing power. If only \"15/20 petaFLOPS\" is noted for GB300 anywhere, this has been incorrectly copied from nVidia's own PDF. &nbsp; Source: [3DCenter.org](https://www.3dcenter.org/news/news-des-26-august-2025)",

The graphics actually look like something on console and not weird clay figures that were in the Switch 1 port. The audio is more crisp and the overall performance is so much better. I turned it off as soon as the aliens landed in the very beginning of the game cause I just couldn't stand looking at completely ugly models. Since I had already bought the Switch 1 version the upgrade was free to me and now I really want to play the game now. I'm still only in the beginning parts(my house just got warped to Blim City) but with this major upgrade I can't wait to see what else the game has in store. I am also a user who plays mostly in handheld mode since my TV isn't the best there is and is a few years behind in the resolution specs. Just wanted people to know that if you have this game and a Switch 2 please give it a chance since Switch 2 upgrade is free and most definitely improved everything so far.",

I went to GameStop to purchase Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3+4 Remastered for Switch 2. They told me they were out of the game, but they had one copy of the Switch 1 version left as a display copy. The employee said that if I bought it, It would unlock both the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions of the game. I wasn\u2019t too keen on just taking his word, so I quickly checked Reddit in the store and found this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/s/GsRsatyuOf I skimmed it and decided to buy the game. --- What happened after I got home: 1. I put the cartridge in \u2014 it downloaded the normal update. 2. After the update, it added a virtual game card for the Switch 2 version. 3. I now had two versions of the game on my home screen. 4. When I tried to launch the Switch 2 version, it said I needed to purchase it \u2014 but the eShop said I was unable to purchase. I contacted Nintendo Support, and they told me there\u2019s currently no upgrade path. So, I took the game back to GameStop (not realizing you can\u2019t return opened/\u201cnew\u201d physical games, especially ones already unsealed as display copies). Out of frustration, I bought it again online. I was only able to do on the eshop website, as on my device, the game was unavailable for purchase. --- The weird part: When I unlocked the Switch 2 version this time, it actually prompted me to transfer my save files from Switch 1, with a whole unique UI menu that appeared on first launch. So why would they not offer a upgrade but have this implemented? --- My theory: This makes me think they either: Originally planned to have a Switch 2 upgrade path, or They will be adding one in the future. So I am putting this post here so that the next guy who has to google it in gamestop doesn't buy the wrong one like I did.",

PN: According to our strategy we plan to add online features to our future games. What we can confirm right now is that Project Sirius will be a multiplayer game. If by \"future games\" they also mean TW4 then unless it was said before that it won't have any, then it's looking like it might have multiplayer components to it.

SDC-enabled platforms have a wide dynamic range and flexibility depending on system load and task requirements using just a core intellectual property substrate. SDC is a software and hardware solution enabling neighboring cores to run as virtual clusters of a super core - reducing the traditional process technology node dependence on scaling core size.\"",

That\u2019s the most since August 2022 and 20% higher than a year ago. * The growth in affordable listings comes primarily from an overall inventory recovery that has slowed price growth \u2014 total inventory is up 18% from last year. Only 31.7% of listings were affordable in July 2025, similar to last year and far below the 53.7% share in July 2020. * More than half of July listings were affordable to the typical household in Buffalo (55.1%), St. Louis (54.5%), Pittsburgh (54.3%), Detroit (52.8%) and Cleveland (50.1%). For first-time buyers, the housing market finally feels like it\u2019s cracking open a little. More homes on the market are within reach of a median-income household than at any time in nearly three years, giving buyers more choices and a bit more leverage. But affordability hurdles remain steep, keeping many would-be buyers from seizing that opportunity. A typical mortgage payment has more than doubled in the past five years, keeping many renters from making the leap to ownership. Sellers, meanwhile, are seeing homes linger on the market longer, and a record number (27.4%) cut their list price in July. Inventory surge lifts affordable listings Affordable listings are surging. In July, roughly 439,000 homes for sale were affordable to a household earning the median income \u2014 meaning they would spend no more than 30% of their earnings on the total monthly payment, including the mortgage, taxes, insurance and maintenance. That\u2019s a 20% jump since last year and the biggest total since August 2022. The jump in affordable listings is directly tied to a rebound in inventory overall. There were more homes for sale in July than in any month since November 2019. Despite the higher count, less than a third (31.7%) of listings in July were affordable to a median-income household. That\u2019s roughly in line with last year (31.1%) and far below July 2020, when more than half of listings were affordable (53.7%). This means that overall affordability has not meaningfully improved, even if there are far more affordable listings for a median-income household to choose from. Affordable new listings show a slight improvement, a signal that it\u2019s not only stale leftovers making up the pool of affordable homes. In July, 33.7% of new listings were affordable to a median-income household, up from 32.4% a year ago. Sellers may be adjusting to today\u2019s more buyer-friendly environment, pricing homes more competitively to help buyers over the affordability hurdle. The regional divide grows Affordability looks very different depending on where you live. While the housing market is becoming friendlier to buyers just about everywhere, that transition is happening at different speeds in different regions. More than half of listings are affordable to median-income households in Buffalo (55.1%), St. Louis (54.5%), Pittsburgh (54.3%), Detroit (52.8%) and Cleveland (50.1%). Sellers generally continue to hold the upper hand in these markets and others across the Midwest because of this affordability advantage. More buyers are able to afford homes, leading to more competition for each listing. Major coastal markets typically have the smallest share of affordable listings, with Los Angeles at the bottom with just 3%. The picture is similarly bleak for median-income households in San Diego (6.4%), Providence (9.1%), Sacramento (11.3%), San Jose (11.4%) and Boston (11.9%). The most buyer-friendly markets can be found across the Sun Belt. Compared to a year ago, the share of affordable listings has grown the most in Austin (+7.9 percentage points), Phoenix (+6 percentage points) and Orlando (+4.9 percentage points). Builders have kept up with demand better in the South, helping inventory grow and price pressure ease. Zillow outlook calls for only modest affordability gains Zillow forecasts home values will fall by about 1% nationwide this year. However, getting the typical U.S. home affordable to a median-income household would take much more. Mortgage rates would need to drop to 4.43% or home values would need to fall 18% \u2014 either of which would likely follow a serious slowdown in the economy and heavy job loss. The only sustainable path to improve affordability is to build more homes. The nationwide housing deficit has grown to 4.7 million homes, which is the root of the affordability crisis. Policies that allow more homes to be built more quickly can help.",

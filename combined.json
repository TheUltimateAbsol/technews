Sales of newly built homes rose a much larger-than-expected 20.5% in August compared with July to the highest level since January 2022, according to the U.S. Census. It is also the largest one-month gain since August 2022. Sales were 15.4% higher than August 2024. This count is based on people out shopping in August and signing deals, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage was higher than it is today. That rate started August at 6.63%, according to Mortgage News Daily, and didn't really move much during the month. The sharp decline in rates began in September, when it fell to a three-year low of 6.13% the day before the Federal Reserve cut its lending rate, and then moved higher to where it is now at 6.37%. Given that rates hadn't fallen yet, it's curious that August sales jumped so high. Part of the answer may be in the survey itself. \"We were expecting a gain but not that large,\" said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. \"Always important to remember the margin of error for new home sales is large. We'll need to wait for revisions next month and the September data point to see if this is smoothed out.\" While builders have talked a lot about cutting prices and incentives, the median price of a new home sold in August was $413,500, in increase of 1.9% year over year. In a separate survey on builder sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders, 39% of builders reported cutting prices in September, up from 37% in August and the highest percentage in the post-Covid period. New home sales were strongest in the Northeast, where overall new construction is low, so swings can be large. It was also strong in the South, where homebuilding is busiest. Sales, while higher, were weakest in the West, where prices are highest. \"While a volatile figure each month and always best to smooth out, I have to believe that the elevated level of home builder incentives was the main catalyst for the large upside surprise to new home sales,\" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of One Point BFG Wealth Partner. \"And we'll, of course, see the impact of lower mortgage rates when the September figure comes out, but keep in mind, if mortgage rates continue down ... builders will then reduce the pace at which they are implementing incentives and thus possibly offsetting the benefit of lower mortgage rates for new homes.\" Strong sales took inventory down to a 7.4-month supply in August from a 9-month supply in July, a nearly 18% drop. Single-family housing starts and permits slowed in August both from July and from August of last year. This would seem to indicate that builders expected slower sales.",

                "raw_content": "KEY POINTS * Total application volume rose 0.6% last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s seasonally adjusted index. * Refinance demand, which had surged to the highest level since, rose just 1% for the week but was 42% higher than the same week one year ago. * Mortgage applications to purchase a home were essentially flat, up just 0.3 % for the week and up 18% from the same week one year ago. After a massive 58% weekly surge in refinance demand the week before, mortgage demand stalled again last week, even though interest rates fell further. Total application volume rose 0.6% last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased to 6.34% from 6.39%, with points increasing to 0.57 from 0.54, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That is the lowest level since September 2024. That, however, is a weekly average, and last week was particularly volatile. Early in the week, before the Federal Reserve cut its rate, mortgage rates, which follow loosely the yield on the 10-year Treasury, fell to the lowest level in three years. In the days after the Fed cut, however, rates rose about a quarter of a percentage point. Refinance demand, which had spiked dramatically higher the week before, climbed just 1% for the week but was 42% higher than the same week one year ago. \u201cInterest rates generally have moved up following the [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting last week but remain in a range that should continue to lead to increased refinance activity. Refinance volume increased further last week and is now 80 percent higher than four weeks ago, accounting for more than 60 percent of all application activity,\u201d said Mike Fratantoni, senior vice president and chief economist at the MBA, in a release. \u201cThe refinance boost last week was from government applications, with VA refinance volume up almost 15 percent.\u201d Mortgage applications to purchase a home were essentially flat, up just 0.3% for the week and up 18% from the same week one year ago. \u201cWhile homebuyer demand typically tends to decrease during the fall, purchase application activity remains relatively strong right now,\u201d Fratantoni added. After a huge surge in demand for adjustable-rate mortgages, demand for those riskier loans fell back last week. Borrowers had been looking for any type of savings on the monthly payment, and ARM rates are much lower than fixed-rate loans. Mortgage rates barely budged to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily, as there were no major economic reports to influence the bond market. There were some speeches from Federal Reserve governors as well as Chair Jerome Powell, but none diverged from previous policy statements. \u201cFed speeches can certainly have an impact, but it depends on the specifics. [Tuesday\u2019s] most important comments came from Fed Chair Powell, but they didn\u2019t represent any major departure from his press conference following last week\u2019s Fed announcement,\u201d wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \u201cStill, some traders were relieved that he didn\u2019t use the opportunity to reiterate several of last week\u2019s topics that pushed rates higher.\u201d",

The rising rents in popular localities kept eating into their monthly budget, leaving little room for savings. Every year, they found themselves negotiating with landlords, packing boxes, and worrying about shifting again. That\u2019s when the thought of owning a home became stronger. After exploring different options across Delhi NCR, they discovered Noida Extension, a location that promised modern housing within a realistic budget. The couple was drawn to the idea of [**3 bhk flats in Noida**](https://miglani.org/what-we-do/) \u2014spacious enough for their small family\u2019s daily needs while also accommodating visiting parents and grandparents comfortably. **1. Rising Rents in Delhi \u2013 The Breaking Point** For years, living in Delhi meant constant stress for a young couple with their little daughter. * Yearly rent hikes made it impossible to plan savings. * Brokerage, high maintenance charges, and frequent shifting added more financial pressure. \ud83d\udc49 These rising expenses kept eating into their savings. The family realized that despite paying lakhs every year in rent, they were building no long-term asset. Example: A close friend in Dwarka had been renting for 6 years. By the time she looked back, she had already spent enough money to cover the down payment of her own flat. That was the turning point for this couple too. **2. Why They Chose Noida Extension** After exploring options across Delhi NCR, they discovered Noida Extension as a smarter alternative. * Connectivity: Metro access, highways, and the upcoming airport link ensure smooth travel. * Lifestyle benefits: Schools, shopping complexes, and reputed hospitals are close by. * Modern living: Gated communities with amenities like green parks, gyms, clubhouses, and even co-working spaces for work-from-home parents. \ud83d\udc49 Compared to Delhi, where the same budget would only fetch an old flat in a crowded locality, Noida Extension offered a modern home in a well-planned township. **3. Life After Moving \u2013 More Than Four Walls** The decision wasn\u2019t just financial\u2014it transformed their daily lives. What started as a search for a compact home soon turned into a bigger dream. The couple realized a home wasn\u2019t only for the three of them\u2014it also had to welcome parents, grandparents, and relatives. That\u2019s when they decided to explore 3 bhk flats in Noida. * A separate room for their little daughter to grow, play, and study. * A guest room where grandparents could stay comfortably during visits. * Extra space for work-from-home setups, festive gatherings, and family bonding. Living in a 3 BHK gave them not just stability, but the joy of creating a place where three generations could live, celebrate, and build memories together. **4. The Bigger Picture \u2013 A Trend Among Families** This story isn\u2019t unique. Market insights show: * Most first-time buyers in Noida Extension are now choosing 3 bhk flats in Noida to future-proof their investment. * Families prefer extra rooms not just for kids, but also to accommodate parents and grandparents. * IT professionals and entrepreneurs value smart amenities like EV charging points, co-working lounges, and wellness centers. \ud83d\udc49 The demand for 3 BHK homes reflects a shift\u2014buyers are no longer just looking for affordability but also for comfort, convenience, and modern lifestyle upgrades. **5. Real Stories, Real Inspiration** Many similar case studies can be found on [**Miglani**](https://miglani.org/), where buyers share journeys of shifting from rented spaces to their first permanent home in Noida Extension. **Conclusion** For young families, the choice between renting in Delhi and owning in Noida Extension is more than just a financial calculation\u2014it\u2019s about stability, security, and quality of life. Rising rents in Delhi continue to drain savings without building long-term value. In contrast, Noida Extension offers an affordable entry point into homeownership, modern infrastructure, and a family-friendly environment. This small family\u2019s story reflects a growing trend: today\u2019s renters are becoming tomorrow\u2019s homeowners, investing in 3 bhk flats in Noida that not only provide shelter but also create space for parents, grandparents, and children to live happily together\u2014building memories, celebrating milestones, and shaping a secure future.",

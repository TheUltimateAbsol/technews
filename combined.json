Clear Linux was not user friendly and perhaps if Intel had made it more user friendly, it might have picked up some adoption. I wonder if some of these may by counterproductive in the long run. Clear Linux has many of the optimizations that demonstrate what is possible with Intel CPUs. Some of it has migrated to other distros like Cachy OS, but it's always easier to control one's own distro. Another consideration is that some of these optimizations are not possible without dropping legacy hardware compatibility (that's part of the reason why Apple does so well, apart from the outstanding M SOCs, they don't hesitate to drop old hardware compatibility and have full control over their software). Perhaps this may be a opportunity as well for AMD to develop its own optimized distro.",

And it gets worse from there. As many people have argued that it is like a 4070 or 4080 even in some cases, but in real games (even when fully ported) it falls short of that lofty claim it seems. The GPU in macs are not magical, but it is nevertheless IMPRESSIVE as heck, given the M4 MAX tdp is 70w, while a 4060 just by itself eats up 115w just on its own, nvm the CPU bits. I can certainly see the whole argument for its own stack of everything from HW to the metal api being super tailored and having efficiency extracted from the thing top to bottom. It is almost console like in that regard. But, it does seem that CDPR was able to tune the game to the point where even M1s can have a smooth gaming experience, just obviously like any older hardware, got to turn things down to get good frame rates.",

I get that it's frowned upon how constant the franchise's output is, but it is still kinda exciting to think we could get something new announced too. That's more fun than 24 minutes of merch, mobile games, and 1 minute of some new Pokemon being added in ZA anyways, which I feel is the sad alternative.",

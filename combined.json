Similar logic applies to the L2 cache claim he makes right after. I feel like without context, those cache capacity numbers are pretty much meaningless.

Do I need to remind people of the 50 series missing ROPs debacle. There's more to gaming than raw compute/TFLOPS. Scheduling, distribution of work and ressources and 3D FF logic to name a few all play a significant role in gaming FPS. * **3070 TI = Sweet spot:** The GA104 die was the sweet spot with 30 series. From 3070 TI -> 3080 3D FF unchanged, while compute ballooned and memory BW got a significant bump. Notice the steep drop in FPS/TFLOPS from 3070 TI to 3080, which is absent with previous generations. * **Remember 3D FF:** In a GPU \u00b5arch already massively geared towards compute like Ampere scaling up compute without 3D FF is a very bad idea, 3070 TI -> 3080 is an example of that. * **NVIDIA's +84CU scaling wall:** NVIDIA's current architecture has significant issues past 84 CUs despite equal scheduling and 3D FF. 40 series has an unchanged 12SM/GPC ratio from 4060 TI - 4080S, but from 4080S-4090 FPS/TFLOPS scaling tanks. Is this a result of Amdahl's law, an architectural Achilles heel or a combination? Who knows * **3D FF not to blame for \\^:** Note how the FPS/TFLOPs dropoff from 4080S-4090 is similar to 5080 -> 5090 when adjusted for the much larger gap in CUDA cores despite the 5090 having identical 3D FF to 4090 and a +59.76% increase in pixel rate over 5080 almost identical to the +58.01% from 4080S to 4090. This is still significantly larger than the raster 4K gains of +52.1% (Blackwell) and +28.75% (Ada Lovelace). Scheduling or something else, not 3D FF, is holding back NVIDIA past 11000 CORES in gaming workloads. * **Higher end likes 4K:** Scaling math is more favorable to higher end cards when resolution is increased. Low end plagued by VRAM and lack of mem BW for 4K, while high end runs into CPU scaling wall at 1080p and even 1440p. Note other variables like workload type distribution also change with res. * **AMD's massive ROPS lead:** Since RDNA 2 AMD has had a massive lead in pixel rate (ROPS througput) per tier. AMD scaled up ROPS with RDNA 2 and 3, while NVIDIA brute forced compute with Ampere. A few examples: 9060XT (204.54) vs 5060 TI 16GB (127.15), 9070XT (381.70) vs 5070 TI (263.62), 7900 XTX (505.15) vs 4080S (304.08), 6800XT (287.87) vs 3080 (187.2). The only exception to this is 3070 TI (178.56, 3070 is similar) vs 6750XT (176.128), but that GPU has 8SM/GPC ratio, unlike 12SM/GPC which is widespread for all other later cards except 5070 and 4060. * **Explaining 5060 TI and 5070 gains:** Blackwell's FPS/TFLOP curve is higher than 40 series from x60-70 tiers, but do note that the new clock generator (1000X higher polling rate) results in much fewer mhz drops resulting in a more stable and higher effective speed plays a role and makes apples to apples comparison impossible. The weak points of previous gen tiers were adressed also: Mem BW bottleneck for 5060 TI and 3D FF and L2 for 4070 (identical to 4070S) + a massive mem BW increase across the board that helps a lot in memory sensitive titles. This is how the 5060 TI and 5070 manages to come close to previous gen higher tiers despite almost no changes in shader count or clocks. * **5070 perf results in scaling drop;** The significant FPS/TFLOPS gain from 4070 to 5070 makes the drop from x70 to 70 TI tier much steeper than with 40 series. 5070 -> 5070 TI reminds me of 3070 TI -> 3080, albeit to a lesser degree. * **Not even mhz scaling is perfect:** As a rule of thumb increased clocks result in lower FPS/TFLOPS scaling numbers. Even mhz scaling isn't perfect and IIRC a while back I calculated a \\~75% scaling efficiency from 30 series to 40 series at iso-core count. RDNA 4 is the exception to the rule but that \u00b5arch is a major architectural rework over RDNA 3 with IPC gains masking the mhz scaling loss. * **Nextgen baseless speculation:** Scaling 3D FF up for NVIDIA nextgen could possibly result in significant gains at high end (past 6000 CUDA cores) but won't adress the current +11000 CUDA core scaling wall, and IDK if this is even possible to address. Maybe there's a slim chance work graphs could help here, but that's years away from widespread game dev adoption, let alone games shipping with it. Also remember that without a major \u00b5arch rework throwing even more cores at the problem is completely pointless. What nextgen does is anyones guess but without adressing this massive scaling wall NVIDIA's nextgen highest end GPUs can only scale up (mhz and IPC) not out (more cores). # Methodology RDNA 3-4 and Ada Lovelace - Blackwell FPS numbers grabbed from [TPU's RTX 5050 review](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/gigabyte-geforce-rtx-5050-gaming-oc/31.html) (July 2025). RDNA 1-2 and Turing - Ampere FPS results retrieved from [TPU's RX 6950XT review](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-6950-xt-reference-design/29.html) (May 2022). RX 6650XT and 6750XT numbers retrieved from TPU's ref card launch reviews. Only raster results no RT, 1080p The pixel rate (3D Fixed Function throughput estimator) and TFLOPs (compute throughput estimator) used in scaling math are adjusted to align with average gaming clock. I've halved the results for RDNA 1+2 and Turing to make it easier compare scaling between gens TFLOPS scaling numbers when reading the line graphs. # Disclaimer These numbers can't be used to say which vendor does GPU's the best in general, but it can be used to measure how efficient their architectures are at scaling up. Do note that NVIDIA has scaled up much further than AMD so, a certain cutoff should be applied for comparisons. Also many thanks to u/WizzardTPU for the FPS numbers over on TechPowerUp.",

But, if there indeed are challenges with NVidia's architecture, that would hopefully make AMD and Intel catch up enough to be real competitors. With (assumptions incoming) new nodes for everyone in the next gen, along with GDDR7 for everyone as well, and AMD/Intel catching up on AI/ML/RT cores, I think things should at least be a bit more unpredictable than the last two generations, which will be a good thing competition wise.",

Running monthly since 1946, the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment survey offers an uninterrupted, long-term record of American consumers\u2019 mood across wars, booms, recessions, and technological change. The July edition shows renewed optimism, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary results, as the Consumer Sentiment Index climbed to 61.8 from 60.7 in June. This slightly surpasses analyst expectations and marks the index\u2019s highest point in five months\u2014February, just after President Donald Trump took office again but months before he shocked markets and allies with his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April. Still, it\u2019s only cause for a muted celebration. Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu characterized the results as \u201clittle changed\u201d from June, \u201cinching up about one index point.\u201d She acknowledged that it\u2019s a five-month high, but \u201cit remains a substantial 16% below December 2024 and is well below its historical average.\u201d A closer look at the data shows that high-wealth consumers don\u2019t share in the generally improving outlook, either. The glum high-wealth American The Current Economic Conditions Index rose 3.1 points to 66.8, indicating growing confidence in near-term business and job prospects. However, the Consumer Expectations Index\u2014reflecting expectations for the coming six months\u2014rose only slightly to 58.6 and remains down 14.8% from last year. Notably, respondents\u2019 outlook on their own finances fell by about 4%, signaling continued individual financial concerns despite the broader improvements. And despite a recent uptick, the surveyors highlight that feelings among high-wealth consumers are still down 17% from December 2024. Short-run business conditions improved about 8%, whereas expected personal finances fell back about 4%. Consumers are unlikely to regain their confidence in the economy unless they feel assured that inflation is unlikely to worsen, for example if trade policy stabilizes for the foreseeable future. At this time, the interviews reveal little evidence that other policy developments, including the recent passage of the tax and spending bill, moved the needle much on consumer sentiment. But there has been a movement on expectations around inflation. Inflation expectations drop sharply One of the most pronounced shifts in sentiment concerns inflation. Year-ahead inflation expectations dropped for the second straight month to 4.4%, down from 5.0% in June and from a peak of 6.6% in May, marking the lowest reading since February 2025. Long-run inflation expectations also receded, falling for a third consecutive month to 3.6% (from 4.0% in June). While these are the most moderate readings in months, both remain higher than levels seen in late 2024, highlighting ongoing wariness about longer-term inflation risk. Hsu noted that inflation remains top of mind for many Americans, with renewed optimism tempered by concerns that price increases could reignite, especially in the context of recent trade policy moves. \u201cConsumers are unlikely to regain their confidence in the economy unless they feel assured that inflation is unlikely to worsen, for example if trade policy stabilizes for the foreseeable future,\u201d Hsu explained. Respondents reported that legislative developments such as recently enacted tax and spending bills had little discernible effect on their overall sentiment. The uptick in consumer confidence comes even as recent economic data show robust retail sales and resilient labor markets, suggesting a disconnect between consumer perceptions and macroeconomic trends.",

                "raw_content": "A pair of congressmen from California and New York unveiled a bill on Friday that would create a government-backed loan program for homeowners to finance the construction of tiny homes on their properties. The bill aims to boost building of accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, in a new effort to tackle the nation\u2019s severe housing shortage. These add-ons are small, studio-style housing units, usually between 600 and 1,200 square feet, that can supplement an existing home in the backyard, garage or basement. Rep. Sam Liccardo, a Democrat from California who co-led the ADU bill with Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican, said the federal government has waited too long to tackle the housing affordability issue. \u201cThis is a really pressing issue for Americans,\u201d Liccardo said. \u201cBut it has not become nearly pressing enough for Congress.\u201d At least 1.4 million single-family homes in the U.S. had such units as of 2020, and their popularity is rising as more homeowners seek ways to lower their housing costs by building and renting out units like these. Others build them to house adult children or grandparents, and home builders are increasingly including ADUs as a new amenity. State and city governments see them as a way to create more places for people to live faster than building full-size multifamily properties that may require more contentious and time-consuming public hearings. The U.S. is short roughly four million homes. Almost a third of all households are considered \u201ccost-burdened,\u201d meaning they spend more than a third of their income on rent or mortgage payments. That housing affordability problem is now becoming a political one for elected officials. State officials in recent months have started to address the need for more housing. Most notably, California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently pushed through two laws that hollowed out the California Environmental Quality Act, which put developers through a lengthy environmental review and undermined new housing development. But federal lawmakers have dragged their feet on major housing legislation. Besides occasional one-off provisions, Congress hasn\u2019t passed a significant policy package focused on boosting housing supply since the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit of the 1980s. President Trump expanded access to the program in his tax package that recently became law. The bipartisan ADU bill represents a rare, if still limited, attempt by Congress to take on the housing crisis. The legislation has endorsements from at least 16 Democratic and Republican House members, along with the National Association of Home Builders and other industry groups. It aims to ease the risk for private lenders to offer second mortgages for ADU construction by providing a government backstop in case the homeowner defaults. Analysts say expanding ADU loan access may indirectly pressure local governments to reform their zoning laws and building codes to allow more of these units. \u201cIf residents have an understandable and reliable means of financing ADUs, it puts the spotlight on localities as the thing holding them back,\u201d said Scott Wild, a consulting principal at John Burns Research and Consulting. An improved ADU-financing system isn\u2019t a magic bullet for the U.S. housing crisis. Builders still face the complex web of local red tape and so-called Nimby pressures that have slowed new construction for decades. But Liccardo said other proposals like homeownership programs are expensive, controversial and harder to get through Congress. \u201cThis happened to be a lower-hanging fruit,\u201d said Liccardo. \u201cIt helps to start in an area where you can actually get something done.\u201d California has led the way in encouraging these units and is experiencing something of an ADU boom. In 2023, the state built roughly 23,000 new ADUs, more than seven times the number in 2018. As the former mayor of San Jose, Liccardo was one of the politicians spearheading zoning reform to promote this development. Other states are following suit. Colorado, Oregon, Arizona, Hawaii and others have all issued their own mandates to motivate ADU production. But as ADU popularity grows, so do the financing gaps. Not all homeowners who want a tiny home add-on can afford to build one. And because an ADU is still a nascent, less traditional construction product, lending options are few and far between. That means that more ADUs skew luxury, built by homeowners who can pay all cash or easily secure a home-equity loan. Liccardo and Garbarino\u2019s bill directs the Federal Housing Administration to provide government backing for second mortgages to finance ADU construction. It also allows Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase and securitize those loans, which would allow lenders to take these second-lien loans off their books. \u201cFinancing is by far the No. 1 blocker for more ADUs,\u201d said Sean Roberts, chief executive of California-based home builder Villa Homes. Over the years, many of his company\u2019s potential projects haven\u2019t even moved forward to the contract stage because his clients can\u2019t get a loan that works for them. The various uses of ADUs make it difficult for appraisers to assess them on a standard basis, which in turn makes it hard to get a loan. \u201cThat\u2019s where I think the federal government can really add something,\u201d Roberts said.",

(July 17, 2025) \u2013 The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) Builder Application Survey (BAS) data for June 2025 shows mortgage applications for new home purchases increased 8.5 percent compared from a year ago. Compared to May 2025, applications decreased by 4 percent. This change does not include any adjustment for typical seasonal patterns.* *\u201cApplications to purchase new homes fell in June, consistent with typical seasonal patterns, but remained ahead of last year\u2019s pace,\u201d said Joel Kan, MBA\u2019s Vice President and Deputy Chief Economist. \u201cA cloudier economic outlook and elevated mortgage rates continues to weigh on potential buyers, while growing inventory, builder incentives, and lower prices have brought some buyers back to the market. As a result, we continue to see home sales ebb and flow. MBA\u2019s estimate of new home sales increased to a sales pace of 667,000 units, up on a monthly and annual basis.\u201d* *MBA estimates new single-family home sales, which has consistently been a leading indicator of the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s New Residential Sales report, is that new single-family home sales were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units in June 2025. The new home sales estimate is derived using mortgage application information from the BAS, as well as assumptions regarding market coverage and other factors.* *The seasonally adjusted estimate for June is an increase of 5.7 percent from the May pace of 631,000 units. On an unadjusted basis, MBA estimates that there were 55,000 new home sales in June 2025, a decrease of 5.2 percent from 58,000 new home sales in May.* *By product type, conventional loans composed 50.0 percent of loan applications, FHA loans composed 35.1 percent, RHS/USDA loans composed 1.2 percent and VA loans composed 13.8 percent. The average loan size for new homes decreased from $379,209 in May to $376,077 in June.*",

Starfield 2.0 is the testbed: This whole Starfield 2.0 upgrade is reportedly serving as a testbed for future Bethesda titles, laying the groundwork for Fallout 5 and The Elder Scrolls VI.

For context, my current build is: i9 13900KS Cooler is an iCue H150i Elite (360mm AIO) RTX 3090 FE 64gb Corsair Vengeance 7200mhz ASUS ROG STRIX Z790-A This build is purely enthusiast/gaming - I use it only for gaming as I have a separate laptop for work. Main games I play are ARC Raiders, BF6, GTA V, Tarkov, DayZ. Unfortunately, I had the dreaded i9 13900ks degradation symptoms occur few weeks ago after 2+ years of having this build. Suddenly, all my games would crash and sometimes even hard-reset the PC. I had no idea about the ongoing issue until further researching my symptoms and so I only updated the bios recently from the 2023 version to the latest 2025 version. My crashing instantly stopped, but I suspected that irreversible damage was done. Sent it in to the retailer that built it - now I am faced with either having an i9 14900k or a 14900ks replacement. Should I get the 14900ks and run 400a - 253w, or stick to a 14900k and run this same setup? Reason why I ask is because I fear my AIO will not be sufficient to handle the 320w recommended Intel extreme setup for the KS, and I do not want to go down the deliding/custom loop route. I am curious if this identical setup would perform better/worse between the 2 CPUs or just be the same, performance & temperature-wise? I have the option of either CPU, but I hear rumours that because the 14900ks is a higher binned chip, it has higher quality silicon? Not sure honestly and I am so conflicted. I really need some advice on this.",

I tested it on several platforms I have access to, and the results were quite interesting. The algorithm itself is very simple. It builds a lookup table (LUT) for a single row and uses LUT lookups to compute both the merge result and the reward. The LUT uses 20-bit entries per ordering (forward and reversed). Each entry stores two `uint32_t` values: (merged result and reward). With both orderings, the total size is about 8 MiB \u00d7 2 = 16 MiB. My assumption is that the LUT is small enough to fit in L3 cache, so cache performance becomes the bottleneck. [Intel CPUs tend to have significantly slower L3 cache](https://chipsandcheese.com/i/152587465/arrow-lakes-caches-bigger-not-always-faster) than AMD CPUs across generations, which likely explains the performance difference.",

The EPYC 7773X likely runs at a low clock speed and has *horrible* memory latency, so it would fall to memory. The 285K has a very slow L3 and slow interconnects. Meanwhile, the R7-5700X and 9900X\\* can fit it in their 32MB L3 easily and can put it in memory if needed, and the M2 can fit it in its 16+8MB SoC cache. \\*AMD chips can *sometimes* reference memory across CCDs, but they prefer not to, and when a cache line is evicted from a CCD it gets sent to RAM (instead of being sent to a different CCD), so functionally AMD cores can only use a single L3.

Our \"leaders\" are doing everything they can to keep assets, including housing, propped up, because they're terrified that letting the bubble pop will cause a massive recession from a reduction in \"wealth effect\" spending. The problem is, by doing this and making the wealth gap worse than since the Gilded Age, they're creating a whole class of unhappy young people. Eventually, there will be blowback and civil unrest like people are not remotely prepared for.

Hallucinations and maths are not as poor as they were even a year ago. But AI is also held back by poor memory for example. He calls this 'reverse salients'. They are the bottlenecks that prevent current AI models to progress further. But if the labs can solve or mitigate these problems, AI will make sudden leaps in intelligence and capability. His most recent example is how Nano Banana Pro can make very good slide decks or powerpoints out of any range of subjects. Generating text on images was something that was very hard to do for AI's. Until Google solved it, with Nano Banana (pro), it has opened much more possibilities.",

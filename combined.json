Then, Biden gets into office and says \"sure thing Jack, you put in the Nordstream pipeline.\" Then, Biden heralds \"Putin will invade the Ukraine, February 2022.\" Everyone laughs. Biden is always wrong. The new Nordstream pipeline is completed to bypass the Ukraine. What's this? Russia suddenly invades the Ukraine. Feel free to fact check me here.",

[Arc 140V is Xe2 (Battlemage) and is used in Lunar Lake] But the Zen-5 X3D chip absolutely still pulverizes Arrow Lake in Gaming. Ultra Low Power: Intel is ONLY competitive in the ultra low power segment where Lunar Lake and soon Panther Lake will shine. X3D might not be good for efficency at low power since SRAM does consume quite a bit of power (unless AMD can power down some L3 slices). AMD's IO die, and infinity fabric is also power hungry compared to Lunar Lake's IO What AMD needs to improve: AMD needs to copy aspects of ARM'S DSU ring bus implementation. In the DSU-120 individual L3, slices can be powered down along with individual cores for efficency. The IO die needs to be connected to the CPU with a specialized low power interconnect since Infinity fabric can't be clocked below a certain frequency since it needs to arbitrate traffic between CCD's using the PCIe bus. (Infinity Fabic connects 2 CCD's using the PCIe bus and maintains cache coherency between each CCD with a lower-performance active directory.) What Intel needs to do: Panther Lake is a good step in consolidating their control over the efficent x86 ultrabook market. (Intel claims that PTL will have the same efficency as LL but it has more SKU's) Nova Lake needs to have bLLC otherwise it's DOA for the desktop DIY space Nova Lake also needs an ultrabook U or V SKU that's faster and more efficent than AMD and competes with ARM. The N1X and future efficent snapdragon laptop parts are likely coming, and it would be stupid for Intel to embrace their famous arrogance and sit on their laurels. Intel should keep the -U SKU for 15w power and make a V SKU for PTL and NVL for 10w power. LL has earned Intel mindshare for efficency, and it should capalize on that with future V SKU products.",

        "text_content": "I wanted to see if extreme overclocking actually gives more FPS than just a regular air OC, if you push both the CPU and GPU together, not just one. I tested a 3060 Ti and 9700K, as I think they are a pretty even and common match. Stock, Air OC, and Subzero OC (glycol coolant -18C). Games tested were SOTTR, Cyberpunk 2077, Horizon Zero Dawn, Red Dead 2 all at 1440p. SOTTR 95-106-111 Cyberpunk 61-69-72 HZD 66-76-79 RDR2 81-84-91 Some games scaled a bit, some not so much. So, full system overclocking can help. But it really depends on the game, and you need the thermals to actually hold the higher clocks. Subzero didn\u2019t just extend the gains, it opened up more scaling where air had already maxed out. There are a lot of variables here, and that's why I didn't do CPU and GPU one at a time, partly because I don't have a spare 1268 hours, but the point was to see if full system OC made a meaningful difference, and if going subzero improved on that. This was all done with the GPU on stock BIOS with no voltage mods. The card I was using turned out to be a bit of a dud, and I think I will have to try this test again with a different card. Not sure if I should use a lower tier card with higher headroom or a mid to high one. Anyway, documented it all if you want to check out the graphs and results.

        "text_content": "Hey folks, wanted to share this in case someone else goes through the same nightmare I did. My setup: GPU: AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT (Aug 2025 driver set) DAC: FiiO K11 (self-powered via external brick) Headphones: Sennheiser HD 560S OS: Windows 11 Pro 24H2 The issue: The moment I installed AMD\u2019s GPU drivers (any version available so far for the 9060 XT), I got constant audio crackles and pops with my USB DAC whenever: Scrolling in Task Manager Alt-tabbing Running games or GPU-heavy tasks This was on a fresh Windows install \u2014 problem wasn\u2019t there with Microsoft\u2019s Basic Display Adapter driver. I also tested with my Razer Barracuda X wireless headset and the problem was much less noticeable or nonexistent. What\u2019s going on: The AMD driver (dxgkrnl.sys) introduces DPC latency spikes under certain GPU actions. The Barracuda X has a large built-in wireless buffer (~20 ms) that masks the issue. The FiiO K11 runs a tiny default buffer (~2\u20135 ms), so every latency spike turns into an audible crackle. Solution / workaround: Keep using AMD GPU drivers (full performance) but increase the DAC\u2019s buffer size in the voicemeeter (app you'll probably need if you have this issue), you'll have to set it up like this: pc sound -> voicemeeter -> fiio asio driver (in there you can add latency) At 2048 samples @ 48 kHz (~42.7 ms one-way latency), crackles are 99% gone. At 1024 samples (~21.3 ms one-way latency), it\u2019s about the same feel as the Barracuda X with very few stutters. You can try walking the buffer down until crackles return \u2014 1024 is my sweet spot, 2048 is the \u201cguaranteed safe\u201d setting. Why this works: Bigger buffer = more time for the DAC to ride out momentary driver spikes before running dry. You\u2019re essentially giving your wired DAC the same safety cushion as a wireless gaming headset. Important: This isn\u2019t a true fix \u2014 AMD needs to address the DPC latency in their drivers. But if you need stable audio now, bumping the DAC buffer will get you there without switching GPUs. --- If anyone from AMD is reading \u2014 reproducible on a clean Windows install with just AMD driver + USB DAC connected. Would love to see a low-latency fix for USB audio in future driver updates. ---",

Interest rates are the problem. Firstly, short-term rates can be cut, but mortgage rates, which are based on the 10-year, can go up. Price is where the adjustment is needed.* \"For people who can afford to buy right now, I tell them not to try to time the market, because you just never know where mortgage rates are going to go.\" *Again, we see a focus on interest rates. While small adjustments to rates are trickier to time, the housing market is most definitely something that can be timed. Housing is a slow-moving cycle that builds momentum. The problem is more that because it's so slow, it doesn't match consumers' shorter time horizons.* *\"* \\[W\\]hen sales slow down like they have right now, sellers also tend to pull back...\" *This is symptomatic of the standoff between sellers and buyers. Again, the industry tactic is FOMO. It's saying to buyers if you fence sit, so will sellers. However, buyers don't have a choice. They can't afford to buy. Sellers mostly have to sell, so delisting just means they will relist once they realize the market is not coming back.* \"For now, buyers have more bargaining power. This moment is here but may not stay very long. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t advise buyers who can afford to transact right now to sit there and hope for a housing market crash\\[.\\]\" *FOMO on steroids. It's clear that the whole article is written to instill fear into would-be buyers. Why? Because sales have fallen off a cliff, and the industry is suffering. The important point to note here is that broad sweeping statements like this are meaningless. All real estate is local. While there may be buyer's markets in some locations, that won't be the case everywhere. Even in those places that have reached a turning point, many are still not strong buyer's markets. A balanced market is 6 months inventory.*",

        "text_content": "The clear limiting factor to the U.S.\u2019s data center infrastructure development, according to a Deloitte industry survey, is stress on the power grid. Cities\u2019 power grids are so weak that some companies are just building their own power plants rather than relying on existing grids. The public is growing increasingly frustrated over increasing energy bills \u2013 in Ohio, the electricity bill for a typical household has increased at least $15 this summer from the data centers \u2013 while energy companies prepare for a sea-change of surging demand. Goldman Sachs frames the crisis simply: \u201cAI\u2019s insatiable power demand is outpacing the grid\u2019s decade-long development cycles, creating a critical bottleneck.\u201d Meanwhile, David Fishman, a Chinese electricity expert who has spent years tracking their energy development, told Fortune that in China, electricity isn\u2019t even a question. On average, China adds more electricity demand than the entire annual consumption of Germany, every single year. Whole rural provinces are blanketed in rooftop solar, with one province matching the entirety of India\u2019s electricity supply. \u201cU.S. policymakers should be hoping China stays a competitor and not an aggressor,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cBecause right now they can\u2019t compete effectively on the energy infrastructure front.\u201d China has an oversupply of electricty. China\u2019s quiet electricity dominance, Fishman explained, is the result of decades of deliberate overbuilding and investment in every layer of the power sector, from generation to transmission to next-generation nuclear. The country\u2019s reserve margin has never dipped below 80%\u2013100% nationwide, meaning it has consistently maintained at least twice the capacity it needs, Fishman said. They have so much available space that instead of seeing AI data centers as a threat to grid stability, China treats them as a convenient way to \u201csoak up oversupply,\u201d he added. That level of cushion is unthinkable in the United States, where regional grids typically operate with a 15% reserve margin and sometimes less.",

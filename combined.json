Now there's a dozen options in that area. Condos have seen lots of softening, driven by HOAs and insurance increasing. I've never seen hard data broken down for condos specifically, but I'd say list prices are easily down 5% yoy, and closer to 10%. A lot of the payment gaps down are getting closed by those rising fees, and some places are becoming straight-up uninsurable. My brother is condo shopping right now, and wanted to put in an offer on a cheap place near a high wildfire risk zone. He backed out once the bank told him that the mortgage would be unwarrantable by the govt / Fannie Mae. The govt ends up owning 95% of mortgages by some estimates, so if they're not lending on a property, you know shit is REALLY bad. Those are the future Florida seaside complexes of CA, in my opinion. There are still plenty of hopium peak-price condo listings on the San Diego MLS, but there's lots of that -10% off peak stuff showing up daily, and even it's not moving quickly. I wouldn't have expected SD property to sit around at any discount, but given that it is, I think there's more softening to go. SFH prices are still in la la land. There's more supply hitting the market, but it's not moving, because it's just entirely out of reach.",

Well, I picked up a Switch 2 and now I have a lot of catching up to do! My collection now consists of: \\* Mario Kart World (digital with the console) \\* Breath of the Wild \\* Super Mario Odyssey \\* Super Mario 3D World w/ Bowser\u2019s Fury \\* Red Dead Redemption \\* Cyberpunk 2077 (digital. Thank you, price error!) \\* Hollow Knight (digital) Since my Steam collection is entirely digital, one thing I wanted with my Switch 2 was to have some physical games. Even if it\u2019s less convenient to have to insert and remove cartridges, I miss the physicality of games in this all digital world, so I knew I wanted at least some games to be physical. BOTW and Odyssey are really the two landmark titles of the Switch generation, so I knew I wanted them to be physical so I could collect them and keep them on my shelf. And I managed to catch them both on sale, which rarely happens for these games ($59 CAD and $55 CAD). And for anything else, it\u2019s a tough call between physical and digital. I haven\u2019t really decided what I want to buy from the eShop vs what I want as a cartridge. I\u2019ve sort of been winging it based on deals I find. Like the $24.99 CAD price on Cyberpunk 2077 was something I couldn\u2019t pass up, even though I have a high end gaming PC that could run the game better. Anyways, this is all just a long-winded way of saying that as a lifelong Nintendo fan who left for several generations, I\u2019m finally back and am excited to catch up on everything I\u2019ve missed!",

        "score": 32,
        "text_content": "It seems to me that Nintendo developed the Switch 2 with third parties strongly in mind. Features such as built in DLSS and ray tracing cores along with the addition of game key cards and microSD express cards are all things that feel like Nintendo really want third party developers to try to put their games over to the platform. Not to mention other stuff like VRR and 120hz on the handheld's display (No way third party games are running at 120 fps, but I always thought the 120hz panel was a move to get third party developers to include a 40 fps option to their games like Cyberpunk). Think about it, it is 2026 and Nintendo has a handful of their own developed games (announced and unannounced) that are coming this year. But will any of the games utilize things like DLSS or ray tracing? Or will Nintendo use these features later down the line? Will they ever use them at all during the Switch 2's generation? If Nintendo didn't have third party developers in mind; they would have chosen a SOC that doesn't have DLSS nor ray tracing cores. They would have stuck with micro SD cards instead of adopting to the new standard of the microSD express cards. Game key cards would have not been a thing and they would have told AAA developers to do what they can with the expensive and slow 64 GB cartridge (the AAA developers would have most likely refuse to port anything over). The 256gb of storage that the console has is small (Nintendo did the same with the Switch and Wii U) but it is UFS 3.1 which is capable of fast read/write speeds. If they didn't care about third parties they would have went with the UFS 2.2 which came out around the same time as UFS 3.1, but has much slower read/write speeds, but it costs much less. There were rumors (not so long ago) that the system was going to have 8GB of ram. This would have been great for Nintendo, but third party developers were going to complain. Fortunately, the system somehow shipped with more ram than a Series S.",

                "raw_content": "Nintendo games are already utilizing DLSS. Pokemon Scarlet/Violet, as well as Pokemon Legends Z-A upscale from 720p to 1440p using DLSS. I personally believe that other games like 3D World or Breath of the Wild don't use it because In the case of 3D World, the game doesn't really need it to reach the resolution it's aiming for. In the case of BOTW, the engine may not yet be updated to support DLSS. I do hope Nintendo decides to implement it later on, because it provides far, far better results than their usual FSR 1 or 2. As for ray tracing, I think Layers of Fear, a Switch 2 port of a fully ray-traced game running at 60fps (very neat, here's a [video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoMay8qSC88&t)about it) gives us a really good look at what Luigi's Mansion 4 could do with Ray Tracing. Imagine that. I'm already excited and its not even confirmed to exist. However, remember that ray tracing is incredibly expensive. While the Switch 2 is competitive with the Series S purely because Nvidia's RT tech is just that much better than AMD's, Nintendo only lets this thing draw like 10 watts max. It will take a lot of wizardry. (Though if any developers out there are wizards, the SW1 generation showed us that it's Nintendo's.) But yeah, this generation is already Nintendo's strongest for AAA support in my opinion. We're getting massive releases like Indiana Jones, Assassin's Creed, Elden Ring and FFVII Remake, as well as huge day-and-date releases like Resident Evil 9, 007 and Pragmata. I'm not going to agree or disagree about whether Nintendo really designed the console with 3rd parties in mind, but they definitely are showing up in force this time around.",

        "text_content": "They're trying to see if they can use frame generation (which is terrible in my opinion) to get this game running at a stable 30 fps. They stated that UE5.7 gave them an fps boost because it was running about half of 30 prior to the UE5 update. It's running around 20 fps at the moment with the new UE5 update. The interesting take from all of this is that in comparison to the Series S they had this to say, \"*The Nintendo Switch 2 has, in effect, more addressable memory than the Xbox Series S, the so-called Lockhart platform, does. And so, since we already had basically scaled ARK: Survival Ascended for Series S, we found that we were in a better memory state than on that console and therefore weren't in a case of running out of memory on the Nintendo Switch 2, even with using more advanced graphics on the Switch 2 than we do on the Series S. But the issue was the GPU primarily being weaker. We were able to use all the primary rendering features. Working on it, we wanted to make sure that it looked essentially like the Xbox Series X version.* *We've downgraded the graphics quite significantly for Series S and we didn't want the Switch 2 experience to be like that. We needed the game to look approximately like the Series X version or the PlayStation 5 version, even if it would be at a lower resolution. So, the issue was not core rendering features. We would have to do Lumen, Nanite, and Virtual Shadow Maps. All three of those things are important to us on Switch 2. I think we may have dropped the shadows to Cascade Shadows rather than Virtual Shadow Maps, which is kind of a slightly older way of handling shadows, but in practice, most users wouldn't be able to tell the difference on a lower resolution device like the Nintendo Switch 2, which for us would be a 1080p handheld 1440p docked resolution as opposed to 4K in either case.\"* In my opinion, frame generation is awful and I would prefer if they tone down the graphics to make it a stable 30 fps.

My integrity as a scientist cannot allow me to do this.** >LeCun has repeatedly argued that LLMs are too limited and that to unlock the true power of AI, a different approach is needed. It's why his startup is reportedly called Advanced Machine Intelligence, the very approach he has argued is better suited than LLMs.",

Grok gets prompted to do creepy, illegal shit all the time, but its safeguards don't seem to tighten much, even after cases like this. Like Grok is still incredibly uncensored when compared to ChatGPT, which is locked down so hard the poor thing tells you to take a step back if you thank it a little too enthusiastically. I wonder why OpenAI's response to scandals has been so restrictive when Grok just... keeps doing what it does for the gooner squad without harsh censorship from xAI.",

        "text_content": "The path to total resource abundance just got a lot clearer. Norwegian startup **Flocean** is set to launch the world's first commercial-scale subsea desalination plant **\"Flocean One\"** marking a radical shift in how we produce fresh water. **The Engineering Breakthrough:** Instead of pumping seawater to land-based plants, the system operates at depths of **300\u2013600 meters**. By tapping into natural ocean hydrostatic pressure to drive the desalination process, Flocean can **slash energy use by 50%** compared to traditional methods. **Key Facts of the 2026 Launch:** **Energy & Emissions:** The technology slashes **both** greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs by half, making large-scale fresh water production significantly more sustainable. **Minimal Footprint:** Because the plant is subsea, it has a **minimal** impact on marine life and requires no expensive coastal real estate. **Scaling Abundance:** With global freshwater **demand** rising, this hydrostatic advantage could finally make desalination cheap enough to solve water scarcity in even the most remote regions. **If we can halve the energy cost of the world's most critical resource, are we seeing the first true signs of a \"Post-Scarcity\" infrastructure being built in real-time?** **Source:** [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/worlds-first-underwater-desalination-plant-launch-2026) **Image:** Subsea desalination plant (Flocean)",

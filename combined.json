Granted with Gigabyte frying chips and ASUS frying chips plus their own motherboards honorably committing seppuku for the chipacide afterwards, there was a lot going on. I built a system a month after AM5 launched with a 7700X and ASRock B650E Riptide Wifi motherboard. Out of the gate VSOC defaulted to 1.25v but was reported at 1.288v by ZenTimings 1.29. VDD Misc was 1.3v, and CLDO was 1.10. Currently VDD Misc defaults to 1.1v, CLDO defaults to 0.95v even when setting 6000 1:1, and now VSOC shows as red if set above even 1.23v. VSOC also now actually delivers the voltage it's set to without running above it, so either ZenTimings changed how it measures or ASRock changed its LLC setting for the VSOC rail. Will have to finish the video later but I do wonder if Steve is factoring in the ever-mercurial voltage defaults all the vendors were using. I know ASRock personally changed and tweaked every single voltage knob & paired LLC knob that existed and was constantly changing them for the first year, and still tweaking them by year two to try and lock down the memory headaches users were having. But some of those default voltages were still nuts even when the X3D chips first launched. So if users did update UEFI versions religiously I could easily see any initial damage caused before the UEFI was updated weakening the chip, thereby triggering a belated failure later despite now running on safer voltages.",

The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order. If a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step. * If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet, and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth checking your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet. * If you have any power-related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting, or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB, and 3.3V rails) can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose. * Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual. * If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM, and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers/buttons you can use; please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS. * If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on. * Make sure your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have \u2014 most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which will allow you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual, as the BIOS flashback procedure will vary depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB. * Make sure your Monitor/TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor/TV if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters, or splitters. Remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort, and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables. * Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games, and applications. * Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware, and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs, and other performance, security, stability, and compatibility issues. * Make sure you are running the latest [Intel drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html). Some devices, such as laptops and handhelds, may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturer's support page. * If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using [Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers. A guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit) * If you have installed GPU drivers after using DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again. * If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like [here](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)), please [view the following](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QHH65SVJ9M#Q25EPyELVdrT) on the steps you can take to prevent this from happening. * If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering, or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues \u2014 more information on disabling MPO is available in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling_multiplane_overlay_mpo_fixed_all/). * If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through [Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB), [Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_EpicGamesStore/c-EpicGamesStore_LauncherSupport/how-do-i-verify-game-files-in-the-epic-games-launcher-a000084923#:~:text=Find%20the%20game%20in%20your,Click%20the%20Verify%20button), [Ubisoft Connect](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/verifying-game-files-in-ubisoft-connect-pc/000060529), [EA App](https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Services-General-Questions/How-to-verify-game-files-of-installed-games/m-p/6578960), [GOG Galaxy](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003930017-My-game-data-is-corrupt-How-can-I-repair-my-game), [Battle.net](https://battle.net/support/article/7655) or whichever game client you are using. * If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly, or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller. * If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values. This can be checked under Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options. * Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware, and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop, and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features, and improve compatibility and interoperability. * If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP \u2014 to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings \u2014 this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities. * If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them. A guide is available here * If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the *below PSU calculators* and make sure the PSU you have (or intend to buy) can supply enough power when your system is under full load \u2014 If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load. * PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html) \u2014 [OuterVision](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) \u2014 [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/) \u2014 [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator) \u2014 [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/) \u2014 [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator) \u2014 [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator) \u2014 You can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate of wattage. * Try to apply common sense to an issue, for example, if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, the DIMM slot on the motherboard, or the pins? Have you tried reseating it, etc... * If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdowns, or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Remember that **just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable** and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system \u2014 many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it. [OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/occt/personal) \u2014 OCCT is the only comprehensive stability testing software available. 20 years of experience have proved OCCT to be the community's software of choice in terms of stability and performance testing. CPU, GPU, Memory, VRAM, and Power supplies are tested in the most efficient and accurate way possible. If there's anything wrong, we'll find it and report it. OCCT includes many advanced features, ranging from per-core CPU testing to varying GPU loads, and much more. [Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) \u2014 Prime95 has been a popular choice for stress/torture testing a CPU since its introduction, especially with overclockers and system builders. Since the software makes heavy use of the processor's integer and floating point instructions, it feeds the processor a consistent and verifiable workload to test the stability of the CPU and the L1/L2/L3 processor cache. Additionally, it uses all of the cores of a multi-CPU / multi-core system to ensure a high-load stress test environment. [AIDA64 Extreme](https://www.aida64.com/downloads/latesta64xe) \u2014 AIDA64 Extreme is an industry-leading system information tool, loved by PC enthusiasts around the world, which not only provides extremely detailed information about both hardware and installed software, but also helps users diagnose issues and offers benchmarks to measure the performance of the computer. [Furmark 2](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/downloads/) \u2014 FurMark 2 is the successor of the venerable FurMark 1 and is a very intensive GPU stress test on Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and Linux (32-bit and 64-bit) platforms. It's also a quick OpenGL and Vulkan graphics benchmark with online scores. FurMark 2 has an improved command line support and is built with GeeXLab. [MSI Kombustor](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/downloads/) \u2014 MSI Kombustor is MSI's exclusive burn-in benchmarking tool based on the well-known FurMark software. This program is specifically designed to push your graphics card to the limits to test stability and thermal performance. Kombustor supports cutting-edge 3D APIs such as OpenGL or Vulkan. [MemTest86](https://www.memtest86.com/download.htm) \u2014 MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns. Bad RAM is one of the most frustrating computer problems to have, as symptoms are often random and hard to pin down. MemTest86 can help diagnose faulty RAM (or rule it out as a cause of system instability). As such it is often used by system builders, PC repair stores, overclockers & PC manufacturers. [MemTest86+](https://memtest.org/) \u2014 Memtest86+ is a stand-alone memory tester for x86 and x86-64 architecture computers. It provides a more thorough memory check than that provided by BIOS memory tests.

                "raw_content": "Today, the Federal Trade Commission sued Zillow and Redfin over an unlawful agreement that eliminates Redfin as a competitor in the market for placing advertising of rental housing on internet listing services (ILSs)\u2014the websites that millions of Americans use to find their next rental home. Zillow Group, Inc., and Zillow, Inc., (Zillow) and Redfin Corporation operate two of the nation\u2019s largest rental ILS networks by traffic and revenue, including sites such as Zillow Rentals, Rent.com, and ApartmentGuide.com. The complaint alleges that in February 2025, Zillow and Redfin entered into an illegal agreement to dismantle Redfin as a competitor in the ILS advertising market for multifamily rental properties. In exchange for a $100 million payment and other compensation from Zillow, the complaint alleges, Redfin agreed: * To end its contracts with advertising customers and help Zillow take over that business, * To stop competing in the advertising market for multifamily properties for up to nine years, and * To serve merely as an exclusive syndicator of Zillow listings, making Redfin sites effectively a copy of the listings that appear on Zillow\u2019s sites. Zillow and Redfin framed their agreement as a \u201cpartnership,\u201d but in reality the arrangement is an end run around competition that insulates Zillow from competing head-to-head on the merits with Redfin, the complaint states. In connection with the agreement, Redfin fired hundreds of employees, then helped Zillow to hire its pick of those terminated workers. \u201cPaying off a competitor to stop competing against you is a violation of federal antitrust laws,\u201d said Daniel Guarnera, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition. \u201cZillow paid millions of dollars to eliminate Redfin as an independent competitor in an already concentrated advertising market\u2014one that\u2019s critical for renters, property managers, and the health of the overall U.S. housing market. The FTC will do our part to ensure that Americans who are looking for safe, affordable rentals receive all the benefits of robust competition between internet listing services like Zillow and Redfin.\u201d The FTC alleges that this agreement destroys competition for multifamily rental properties advertising on ILSs, harming both property managers seeking to advertise properties for rent and renters searching for a home. The agreement also constitutes an unlawful acquisition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, the complaint alleges. The FTC alleges that the unlawful agreement will: Likely lead to higher prices and worse terms for multifamily unit advertising; and Reduce incentives for Zillow and Redfin to compete for renters, including through investment in attracting visitors and innovation to improve user experience when searching on an ILS for a rental property. The complaint seeks to stop Zillow and Redfin from continuing their unlawful agreement and contemplates a potential divestiture of assets or the reconstruction of businesses to restore competition.",

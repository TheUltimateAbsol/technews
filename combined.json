The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, born of the Civil Rights Act, said it was investigating \u201csystemic allegations of D.E.I.-related intentional race discrimination\u201d against white employees and job applicants at Nike. It appears to be the first time that the commission has said diversity, equity and inclusion practices in workplaces can amount to discrimination against white people, and Nike is a high-profile target. The company has sponsorship partnerships with world-famous athletes including LeBron James and Caitlin Clark. It also drew criticism from President Trump during his first term for running advertisements featuring Colin Kaepernick, the football star who knelt during the national anthem to protest racism and police brutality. The move positions the E.E.O.C. at the vanguard of the Trump administration\u2019s broad assault on D.E.I. practices. Mr. Trump won re-election in 2024 in part by harnessing backlash to such practices, and in office he has given voice to claims of \u201creverse racism\u201d against white people.",

It misattributes historical NIH spending on animal research grants\u2014totaling around $241 million over multiple years, primarily under previous administrations\u2014to a new authorization by the GOP-led Congress in 2025. In reality, the Republican-controlled Congress in 2025 held oversight hearings to expose and criticize such expenditures as wasteful, attributing them to the Biden-Harris era, and even introduced bills to prohibit future funding for similar experiments. > >The $250 million figure appears to originate from reports by the White Coat Waste Project (a conservative-leaning watchdog group opposed to animal testing), which calculated cumulative NIH grants involving hormone therapies, surgeries, or other interventions on animals like mice, rats, and monkeys to study health effects related to gender-affirming care or sex hormones. These grants span decades, not a single 2025 authorization, and focus on medical research for conditions like HIV susceptibility, asthma, fertility, and cancer risks in humans\u2014often using \"transgenic\" (genetically modified) models rather than literally \"transgender\" animals. President Trump highlighted smaller subsets of this spending (e.g., $8 million) in early 2025 speeches to criticize prior waste, but no evidence shows the GOP Congress approved new funds for it.",

I also know people that will seethe if a game drops below 120fps. No one is ever going to change their mind either \ud83e\udd37. I personally am fine with the compromises in both docked and handheld, but would never try to convince someone that isn't happy that it's fine. Just not worth the effort",

It just means they were likely reviewed by an examiner at the same time--this is normal USPTO behaviour. Publication date means that the USPTO has accepted a filed trademark and it will soon be published, which will be immediately followed by a 30-day opposition period. During the opposition period, other trademark holders are entitled to file a complaint on the grounds that the trademark in question infringes on their rights. Consequently, the publication date of a trademark **does not** mean 'this product needs to be revealed by \\[date\\]'. If the games *were* shown on this date, that's just a weird coincidence, as a 'publication date' is just a milestone towards the formal registration of a trademark and has no bearing on the marketing of a product, lol.",

        "text_content": "Ubisoft held an internal Town Hall Q&A meeting with employees yesterday to instill confidence in the company\u2019s upcoming changes, but, according to over a dozen employees who spoke to Insider Gaming anonymously, it appears to have had the opposite effect. The Town Hall featured a host to read out the questions, along with Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, Executive Vice President C\u00e9cile Russeil, Chief People Officer S\u00e9bastien Froidefond, CFO Frederik Duguet, and Chief Studios & Portfolio Officer Marie-Sophie de Waubert, in a roundtable format. According to those who spoke to Insider Gaming, employees described the Town Hall as an expert class in avoiding questions, with executives repeatedly sidestepping or recycling earlier statements. The host said that more than 300 questions were submitted for the Q&A, with sources noting that some had 700-800 upvotes, 3-4 times the number from past Q&A calls. When asked why they thought this was, many said it was due to the frustration, anger, and betrayal employees felt from the current announcements. Insider Gaming was sent a recording of the Town Hall under the condition that it would not be made public. **Full Story:** [https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-internal-town-hall-fails-to-reassure-employees-on-its-future/](https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-internal-town-hall-fails-to-reassure-employees-on-its-future/)",

For example, if progress mostly came from throwing more tokens at a problem, that would obviously still be good, but we'd likely run into massive inference bottlenecks soon. I guess to half-way answer my own question, at least the [Codex 5.3 release notes](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/) seemed to note that it achieved equal performance to earlier models on SWE-bench at half the token count, which seems good.

So it\u2019s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem. Improving the testing harness required finding high-quality compiler test suites, writing verifiers and build scripts for open-source software packages, and watching for mistakes Claude was making, then designing new tests as I identified those failure modes. This is critically important, and something that most other real world projects won't have ahead of time. Something like a high quality test suite just won't exist for most projects. In the real world you might not even know what to test for, because designing the program will be an iterative process requiring testing and feedback as you go. The waterfall model where you know ahead of time not only what the end result should be but also what to test for and how to test it is the only way long-running mostly autonomous agentic programming like this is going to work, and that's only going to be achievable for a relatively small percentage of projects.",

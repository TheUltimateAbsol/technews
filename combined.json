                "raw_content": "Governor Greg Abbott Real Texans do not run from a fight. But that\u2019s exactly what most of the Texas House Democrats just did. Rather than doing their job and voting on urgent legislation affecting the lives of all Texans, they have fled Texas to deprive the House of the quorum necessary to meet and conduct business. These absences are not merely unintended and unavoidable interruptions in public service, like a sudden illness or a family emergency. Instead, these absences were premeditated for an illegitimate purpose\u2014what one representative called \u201cbreaking quorum.\u201d Another previously signaled that Democrats \u201cwould have to go by an extreme measure\u201d of a quorum break \u201cto stop these bills from happening.\u201d In other words, Democrats hatched a deliberate plan not to show up for work, for the specific purpose of abdicating the duties of their office and thwarting the chamber\u2019s business. That amounts to an abandonment or forfeiture of an elected state office. When the Governor calls a Special Session, our Constitution provides that the \u201cLegislature shall meet.\u201d TEX. CONST. art. III, \u00a7 5 (emphasis added). It\u2019s not optional. It\u2019s a duty. The absconded Democrat House members were elected to meet and vote on legislation\u2014not to prevent votes that may not go their way. Every session, legislators on both sides of the aisle find themselves on the losing side of a legislative vote. And every session, most of those legislators find a way to disagree agreeably and behave like adults, rather than going AWOL. This truancy ends now. The derelict Democrat House members must return to Texas and be in attendance when the House reconvenes at 3:00 PM on Monday, August 4, 2025. For any member who fails to do so, I will invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House. In that Opinion, the Attorney General considered \u201cwhether Texas law allows for a determination that a legislator has vacated office\u201d if they intentionally break quorum. The Attorney General concluded that \u201cwhether a specific legislator abandoned his or her office such that a vacancy occurred will be a fact question for a court.\u201d He further concluded that \u201cthrough a quo warranto action, a district court may determine that a legislator has forfeited his or her office due to abandonment and can remove the legislator from office, thereby creating a vacancy.\u201d That empowers me to swiftly fill vacancies under Article III, Section 13 of the Texas Constitution. In addition to abandoning their offices, these legislators may also have committed felonies. Many absentee Democrats are soliciting funds to evade the fines they will incur under House rules. Any Democrat who \u201csolicits, accepts, or agrees to accept\u201d such funds to assist in the violation of legislative duties or for purposes of skipping a vote may have violated bribery laws. See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 36.02. The same could be true for any other person who \u201coffers, confers, or agrees to confer\u201d such funds to fleeing Democrat House members. I will use my full extradition authority to demand the return to Texas of any potential out-of-state felons.

        "text_content": "**I. Introduction** To start, I'd like to say that I do really like some of the strides they made in this game. I like the concept of the interconnected world and I think that was a neat way to differentiate this from MK8. The amount of tricks and different paths you can take in a course is pretty cool too. The MK gameplay that you know and love is here and it's still great. Knockout Tour is also a fantastic mode and that is something that can only be possible in this game. With that said, as someone who has played a ton of MK8 for the last 10 years: I am finding it hard to feel enthusiastic about this entry in its current state. I've played for about 15 hours and I feel like I've seen most of what the game has to offer. VS mode and battle mode are still a blast, but they are the same modes we've been playing for a long time. Free Roam I also find incredibly disappointing and this seemed like the premier mode in the initial marketing. I just don't feel like the game has given me a lot of reasons to stick with it besides the occasional session with friends. I'm sure this will get a lot of updates over the next 7-8 years, but I can't help and wonder why after 10 years of MK8 that this game feels lacking. Anyways, I'll expand on what really disappointed me with this game. **II. Free Roam** During the NS2 debut Direct, this seemed like such a great idea. A world you can explore and discover hidden things and possibly even have a dedicated story/career mode. However, when you turn on the game, free roam is not even a mode you select from the traditional menu--it's nestled in the bottom right corner of the screen. It is almost like an afterthought and, after playing some hours with it, I can get why they did that because there isn't much exciting content there. You just drive around aimlessly and do some P-switch challenges and find some medallions. Neither give you any rewards and it's hard to track them because there isn't really a menu within free roam that you can refer to easily. The challenges are fun at first, but that's all there really is to do and they got old fast for me. I just find the whole mode wasted potential. There could have been a story mode with a central hub where you can complete missions and unlock certain things like costumes, karts, skins for the karts, etc. Considering the advance movement you can do in this game, there could have been boss battles you could find and fought in the world. There could have been NPCs you could find and talk with in the world where you could collect items or get missions from. Or different things happen at different times of the day. There is just so much potential you could have done with it. The world they made is really beautiful, but I don't have much incentive to explore. Maybe instead of making 394 p-switch challenges, they could have diversified the type of content you could do in the world. This entire mode just feels like wasted potential. **III. Online Quality of Life** I know this is Nintendo and they suck at online and all that, but c'mon man. I can't make a party with friends and join a match together? One of us has to start a regular race and then we have to hope we can get into the race. In Knockout Tour, you can't even join with friends--what's up with that? Also when you leave a race, you're booted to the main menu and have to reconnect to the online. It's just kind of annoying. The majority of people are going to play this game online and yet they didn't have the foresight to try and work out some of these basic features? I just don't understand why they neglect stuff like this. It is incredibly frustrating. **IV. More Modes** Maybe this is me being too greedy, but I was hoping this game would be packed to the brim with new modes. Even if they were smaller mini-game-like modes, I was hoping this game was going to be packed with different type of content you could do. Knockout Tour is a great addition, but I was hoping we would also get one that is bit unconventional like battle mode. Something that isn't directly related to racing, but you're still using the Kart. If free roam offered more interesting content, I may not have felt this way. But I'll concede this is me probably asking for too much. **V. In-Game Events** It feels like there isn't really anything to look forward to in-game. This game is essentially Nintendo's live service game that they'll be supporting for a long time, but the game doesn't really feel that way as of now. I think they could have borrowed some ideas from Splatoon and have in-game events that people could look forward to and try to participate in every so often. But they have nothing of the sort in this game. **VI. Conclusion** After 10 years of MK8, I was hoping MKW would have been a groundbreaking title for the series that would have pushed the series forward and be packed with all sort of interesting content. Instead, the game feels halfway there. There are great ideas here, but some are undercooked and the omission of certain features is baffling. MKW feels more iterative as a result and that is a shame. The game is still great to play with friends online or couch co-op, but I had higher hopes for this game. Ultimately, I feel underwhelmed by what is offered even though it is still a lot of fun. If you are able to get the NS2 bundle like I did then I think it's worth it, but I would have a harder time recommending this game at $80 until more updates come out.",

I don't find the new features of wall riding/grinding intuitive (the controls are difficult?), and the increased player count makes the game a bit TOO chaotic. There are some cool courses but they also haven't felt very memorable at all. I don't mind the intermission courses, but I do think I preferred the 3 lap format as it helped you learn courses faster and remember them. That muscle memory became part of the skill, and made you attached to your favourite tracks; whereas now, most courses are places you drive straight through and that's that. It has dropped to a 7/10 for me, I hope Nintendo develops it further because it feels like there's potential but it needed more time in the oven.",

NYC\u2019s RE market is interesting but different from anywhere else in America. > I\u2019ve also reminded myself many times that the money we used for the down payment isn\u2019t \u201cgone.\u201d We\u2019ve just invested it in a different way. Unlike dropping money on a designer ensemble or new car, an apartment is an appreciating asset\u2014at least usually. The one-bedroom unit we are purchasing has gone up 20% in value in the five years since it was last on the market. this is actually probably going to ultimately be somewhat true. NYC apartments aren\u2019t that \u2018bubbly\u2019. unlike say, the condos in the city. apartments didn\u2019t crash that hard in 08 and they\u2019re not going to this time. the price-to-rent ratio is low already. but the problem i have with this article, is people (morons) will read this, not examine it thoughtfully, and take away the wrong ideas. it\u2019s not normal, a rite of passage, or a good idea to buy a condo in Denver, for example, with a PTR ratio of like, 25%. you are going to lose all your downpayment money and be underwater for a decade+. you are going to be financially (and physically) trapped. the stress is going to be immense. you\u2019ll have signed-on to throw away years of your life, and it was painfully clearly avoidable. (rent vs buy calculations \u2026 well, they *were* common knowledge for the one thing to evaluate before making a home purchase.) you only get a few decades of life, if you\u2019re lucky. overburdening 5-10yrs of one\u2019s short existence because of FOMO and not doing maybe an hour of research is really sad, but an idiot is born every minute.",

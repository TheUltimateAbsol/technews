        "score": 1159,
        "text_content": "&#x200B; Xbox fans had been anticipating the retirement of Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer for years, but what most hadn\u2019t expected was the departure of Xbox president Sarah Bond too. For many outside the company, Bond seemed like Spencer\u2019s natural successor, a deputy of sorts. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood clearly didn\u2019t agree. Instead of picking Bond for the role, Microsoft promoted Asha Sharma, a former Microsoft AI executive, to the top of Xbox. The decision to overlook Bond might have surprised many Xbox fans, but for the more than a dozen current and former Microsoft employees I\u2019ve been speaking to, it\u2019s felt inevitable in recent months. Phil Spencer, Microsoft\u2019s long-term Xbox chief, made the decision to resign from Microsoft last year after a tough few years for Xbox. The giant Activision Blizzard acquisition had dragged on for far longer than Microsoft had anticipated, and the need to grow the business saw Microsoft walk away from Xbox-exclusive games in favor of a multiplatform strategy. Microsoft has also been trying to reinvent the Xbox brand beyond the console, with mixed results. Spencer\u2019s decision led to months of careful successor planning. It was announced to the world on Friday, but it was supposed to be today. Microsoft was forced to announce early because it started to leak and IGN was planning to run a story, according to sources familiar with the situation. That kicked off a day of chaos, where teams inside Xbox were hearing the news first through reporters and news outlets, instead of via internal memos. The team running Sarah Bond\u2019s social media accounts was so unprepared that a LinkedIn post inviting people to provide feedback about Xbox accessibility features went live just before her departure was announced. It sat there for hours, until Bond\u2019s team eventually posted her own memo. Microsoft executives shared four memos with Xbox teams on Friday, but only Phil Spencer mentioned Bond. Satya Nadella, Microsoft Gaming EVP Matt Booty, and new Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma all had kind words for Spencer, but no mention of Bond. Even Bond\u2019s own memo to her teams didn\u2019t arrive until hours after the announcement and wasn\u2019t part of Microsoft\u2019s blog. Some Xbox employees I\u2019ve been speaking with saw the writing on the wall for Bond last year. She was promoted to Xbox president in October 2023, just days after Microsoft finalized its $68.7 billion deal to acquire Activision Blizzard. Bond had been crucial in getting the deal over the line with regulators and slowly started to become the face of Xbox as Spencer took on the complicated duties of integrating a huge new business into Microsoft Gaming. Six months after Bond\u2019s promotion, Xbox executive Kareem Choudhry, who reported directly to Bond, departed Microsoft and triggered another shake-up of some teams inside Xbox. Choudhry was key to Xbox\u2019s backward compatibility support and helped bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to life as xCloud in 2019. Just weeks after Choudhry departed, former Xbox chief marketing officer Jerret West also left Microsoft in June 2024. That meant the Xbox marketing team was now reporting directly to Bond. A month later, Microsoft delivered a marketing campaign that signalled people didn\u2019t need to buy an Xbox console anymore. The message was that \u201cyou don\u2019t need an Xbox to play Xbox,\u201d because games were available through Xbox Cloud Gaming on TVs. This was all part of the \u201cXbox everywhere\u201d strategy that Bond had been pursuing, a vision to move the Xbox brand beyond its roots in console hardware. Months later the \u201cThis is an Xbox\u201d campaign launched, with commercials that positioned a phone or a tablet as an Xbox instead of just a console. It was a confusing campaign, and I\u2019m told it offended many Xbox employees internally. \u201cThis is an Xbox\u201d also debuted months after Bond appeared on stage at the Bloomberg Technology Summit and announced an Xbox mobile gaming store that was supposed to launch in July 2024. It still doesn\u2019t exist almost two years later. Although attempts to redefine Xbox were clearly tied to the mobile store efforts, Microsoft still went ahead with \u201cThis is an Xbox\u201d after the store was delayed. The pivot away from console, led by Bond, under Spencer\u2019s direction, hasn\u2019t gone well for Xbox. Microsoft\u2019s Xbox hardware revenue has declined for three financial years in a row, and it looks like those declining revenues are going to continue throughout fiscal 2026. Most of the current and former Xbox employees I\u2019ve spoken to in recent days are relieved that Bond is leaving Microsoft. I\u2019ve heard from multiple sources that Bond has been tough to work with, and built a team structure that meant if you didn\u2019t follow the vision or questioned it, you were out. Most have praised her ability to strike partnerships with companies and developers, though. I wrote in December 2024 that Bond had \u201cstaked her career reputation on the idea of Xbox being everywhere, across multiple platforms and devices.\u201d This also involved carefully managing her image both internally and externally, making her appear to be a gamer like Phil Spencer. In reality, she wasn\u2019t. I understand that Bond\u2019s strategy had been failing internally and been questioned multiple times. Bond had tried to push mobile and cloud over console, to reach potentially millions more Xbox customers, but the result has been a classic case of chasing tomorrow\u2019s customers by neglecting today\u2019s. Phil Spencer\u2019s retirement has seemed inevitable to Xbox employees, particularly over the past year. In February last year, Spencer took a long vacation, and I\u2019m told some teams had to wait weeks for sign-off on some key changes. Shortly after this vacation, rumors started circulating inside Microsoft that Spencer was getting ready to retire. Microsoft was eventually forced to deny the rumors in July, claiming Spencer wouldn\u2019t be retiring \u201canytime soon.\u201d With Spencer\u2019s retirement official, Microsoft is hitting the reset button on Bond\u2019s Xbox strategy instead of embracing it further. Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma is now promising \u201cthe return of Xbox,\u201d in a clear message to employees that the strategy over the past few years has not been working. \u201cI want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place,\u201d says Sharma. Xbox employees I\u2019ve been speaking to have been concerned about the Sharma appointment, particularly because of her previous role as an AI executive at Microsoft. There is also concern about her lack of industry experience in entertainment and gaming. Sharma has been clear she\u2019s not a gamer and has spent the weekend responding to people on X and even taking game recommendations. Some Xbox employees worry she\u2019ll force AI into everything Xbox does, but Sharma was clearly ready for that reaction. \u201cAs monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop,\u201d said Sharma in her memo. \u201cGames are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.\u201d The other concern is that she\u2019s been appointed by Nadella as some kind of executioner of the Xbox console. Her memo doesn\u2019t suggest that, and Microsoft could have easily appointed Matt Booty into that kind of role to push game publishing instead of the Xbox console. I get the impression from sources that Microsoft wants a turnaround and is worried about losing Xbox, as it\u2019s one of its only remaining successful consumer brands. Those who know Sharma better describe her as enthusiastic, willing to learn, and very capable of getting teams to execute on a clear vision rather than coming in as a product executioner. She also has a history at Instacart and Meta of overseeing platform launches and getting people to use products, the type of user acquisition that Xbox has failed at in recent years. Sharma\u2019s non-gaming credentials don\u2019t mean she can\u2019t do a good job at Xbox, but it will still be a tough gig to step into the shoes of Phil Spencer, who is widely respected inside and outside of Microsoft. He will be remembered for the impact he had in turning Xbox around more than a decade ago. Xbox could have easily died after the Xbox One disaster, but Spencer made transformative decisions that have benefited the entire gaming industry. Xbox led the way in consumer-friendly decisions like crossplay, or allowing consumers to buy a game once and play it across both PC and console. Under Spencer\u2019s watch, Game Pass has also forced competitors to offer similar subscription services. Spencer is also departing at a time when the Xbox Series S / X generation has failed to put a dent in Sony\u2019s PlayStation sales and during a period of turmoil in the game industry and within Xbox. Layoffs and studio closures have plagued the Xbox division after the Activision Blizzard acquisition, and there are big questions about Microsoft\u2019s gaming acquisitions, the side effects of its Game Pass push, and the future of the Xbox console itself. Spencer won\u2019t be here to answer them anymore. Sharma now has the opportunity to define the next 25 years of Xbox, and we\u2019re about to find out if she can turn Xbox around and execute on a clearer strategy. \u201cThe next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through,\u201d says Sharma. \u201cWe have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again.\u201d https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad?view\\_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IkpYeERHeWF6NUwiLCJwIjoiL3RlY2gvODgzMDE1L21pY3Jvc29mdC14Ym94LW5ldy1jZW8tc2hha2V1cC1ub3RlcGFkIiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMjkwNjAwLCJpYXQiOjE3NzE4NTg2MDB9.getJ-3kspePX7CrVmely9uWHy0nEaJuj6YCKKbJMCfU&utm\\_medium=gift-link",

The South and West are home to the strongest buyer\u2019s markets. There were an estimated 44% more home sellers than buyers in the U.S. housing market in January (or 600,314 more, in numerical terms). That\u2019s up from 30% more a year earlier and represents the second largest gap in records dating back to 2013. The largest gap was in December 2025, when sellers outnumbered buyers by 45%. **There Are Only Five Seller\u2019s Markets** The strongest seller\u2019s market in January was Newark, NJ, which had an estimated 31% fewer sellers than buyers. The other four seller\u2019s markets were Nassau County, NY (-29%), Milwaukee (-26%), Montgomery County, PA (-26%) and New Brunswick, NJ (-17%). Redfin analyzed the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. \u201cTwo things are fueling Milwaukee\u2019s seller\u2019s market: a drop in mortgage rates and a lack of inventory,\u201d said local Redfin Premier real estate agent W.J. Eulberg. \u201cMortgage rates are lower than they were six months ago and a year ago, which has brought buyers back into the fold. And while listings are creeping back up, we still have less than three months of supply. That means buyers don\u2019t have a lot of homes to choose from, which is driving up prices and competition.\u201d The median home sale price in Milwaukee rose 11% year over year in January\u2014the largest increase among the top 50 metros. On average, home prices rose 5% year over year across the five seller\u2019s markets in January, compared with a 3% gain across the six balanced markets and a 1% increase across the 39 buyer\u2019s markets\u2014an indication that buyer\u2019s markets offer house hunters more leverage. Many of the nation\u2019s buyer\u2019s markets are in the Sun Belt or on the West Coast, while the balanced markets and seller\u2019s markets skew more toward the Midwest and East Coast. **The Strongest Buyer\u2019s Markets Are In the South** The strongest buyer\u2019s market in January was Miami, which had an estimated 159% more home sellers than buyers. Next came Fort Lauderdale, FL (128%), Austin, TX (124%), Nashville (120%), and San Antonio (114%). The Sun Belt skyrocketed in popularity during the pandemic, when scores of homebuyers moved in from more expensive parts of the country. To meet surging demand, homebuilders ramped up activity, which is one reason there are now a lot more homes for sale than people who want to buy them. The pool of buyers has also shrunk because soaring housing costs in recent years have priced many people out of the market. New construction can have a significant influence on whether negotiating power lies with buyers or sellers because it impacts the balance of supply and demand. The Northeast and the Midwest have historically issued the fewest building permits, while the South and the West have issued the most. Florida and Texas continue to build more homes than other states. Florida is also grappling with intensifying natural disasters, soaring insurance premiums and rising condo HOA fees, which has prompted some homeowners to leave. Miami, specifically, frequently shows up as a buyer\u2019s market because it has a lot of housing supply, which could be in part due to the high number of condos.",

The average top-tier 30yr fixed rate fell back to 5.99% today, matching the levels seen only briefly back on January 9th, 2026 when the Fannie/Freddie bond buying plans were announced. Much like the last time, there's always a risk that something happens to prompt a bond market reversal today. If that happens, mortgage lenders could raise rates in the middle of the day. But unlike last time, mortgage rates have eased down to current levels in a much more gradual and--dare we say--sustainable way. After all, today's improvement is only a moderate 0.05% vs Friday. Back on January 9th, the initial day-over-day jump was more than 0.20%. There's no new news causing the improvement. The broader bond market has gradually improved to the best levels since November and the mortgage-backed securities market (the bonds that directly dictate mortgage rates) have performed better than normal vs the broader market due to Fannie/Freddie purchases. https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/markets/mortgage-rates-02232026",

We're effectively a bunch of hermit crabs trading up in shells when more housing is added, even luxury housing. Get enough competition and the trash that can currently find renters won't be able to. >Although \u201clocal governments have developed some spectacular new low-income housing in recent years, their capacity to do so is limited by the enormous amount of money required.\u201d In Boston, \u201cnew affordable units cost the city about $650,000 each.\u201d New market-rate construction, \u201cby contrast, usually contributes money to the public coffers through fees and taxes.\u201d If I reading that correctly, Boston's \"at cost\" construction of affordable units is still $650k and doesn't pay all the fees into the system. The cost of construction is the biggest problem to affordability. So if I'm building an \"affordable\" unit of $650,000 and wanted a 6% return on the place as a rental, I'd need to receive NET $3900 in rental income per month. Even if I wanted to make absolutely no money, but just break even after depreciation of the asset over 27.5 years, I'd still have to clear $2,000/month net. That's after all utilities, maintenance, tax, and insurance costs. That's the floor that no one will ever go with. The only way \"out\" that I see is paying people enough to be able to afford where prices are now because the cost of construction will prop up all the old homes with huge prices. Or it's entirely too early for me and I've misread everything. :)",

Like the example they provided, if the solution didn't have a function called \"get_annotations\" (which wasn't specified in the problem) then it fails the tests. So the reason why models were plateauing at around 80% was because somewhere on the order of > 16.4% of problems on the benchmark was flawed. Edit: I'm curious what this implies for the AI 2027 authors, given they expected 85% in 2025, but hard to do that if 16.4% of the test was flawed",

This is the largest one-time seizure of counterfeit pills in Colorado history, and the sixth-largest, single seizure of suspected fentanyl pills in United States history. \u201cThis played out like an episode of a TV show, where a winning bidder legally bought a storage unit and unbeknownst to them, the unit contained 1.7 million counterfeit fentanyl pills and another 12 kilograms of fentanyl powder,\u201d said DEA Rocky Mountain Field Division Special Agent in Charge David Olesky. \u201cThere is no doubt many lives have been saved by keeping these poison pills of the streets of Colorado.\u201d Upon noticing the contents of the storage unit, the bidder immediately contacted the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cI want to thank the citizen who reported this discovery, the storage facility staff for their cooperation, and the deputies who responded quickly and professionally,\u201d said Douglas County Sheriff Darren Weekly. \u201cLet me send a strong and unmistakable message: fentanyl and illegal narcotics will not be tolerated in Douglas County. Our deputies, detectives, and crime lab professionals are committed to keeping this community safe, and we will remain relentless in that mission.\u201d The record seizure is connected with an ongoing DEA and Colorado Bureau of Investigation case. The registered owner of the storage unit is already in federal custody. \u201cThe seizure of these drugs represents countless lives saved, as these dangerous substances will never reach our communities. Our mission to get drugs off the streets and put traffickers behind bars remains as vital as ever,\u201d Colorado Bureau of Investigation Director Armando Saldate stated. In addition to the 1.7 million pills, the 12 kilograms of powder seized had the potential to yield up to an additional six million pills. Colorado Governor Jared Polis praised the hard work of federal, state, and local law enforcement. \u201cI want to thank everyone who helped us with the largest successful fentanyl seizure in Colorado history. Getting more of this deadly drug off the streets saves lives. In Colorado, we are cracking down on crime, apprehending dangerous criminals, and keeping our communities safe. I thank the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and our federal partners for working with us to get criminals off of Colorado streets, out of our communities, and ensure Coloradans and families are safe,\u201d said Governor Polis. Due to the ongoing investigation, no further updates are planned at this time.",

A lot of people compared him to Reagan but he could also be compared to Bill Clinton, just on levels of ACTUAL scandal alone, Trump is tame. Plenty of people ree-ree'd about shit back in the day as well, but not to such extreme and wildly outlandish degrees as they do today over Trump. Who again, when you really peel yourself back from all of it, all of them, all of us, all of this little MAGA ecosystem of our very own as well, just looking at Trump as a perfect stranger, there's nothing all that wild or outlandish about him - if people weren't ree'ing and screaming at him he wouldn't even be this spectacle he has become.

The Zen 4 CPU it has is very respectable, but it lacks one of AM5's biggest selling points which is upgradeability. You will not be able to drop an 11500X3D into this thing when that chip drops in like 2030 the way you would if you went with a cheap AM5 build right now.

I\u2019ve managed to clean a lot of it up but there is still some in the USB ports and in and around the actual connector. I tried to open it up so I could clean the plastic as best I could but some of the screws on the bottom of the dock are too firm and I can\u2019t unscrew without risking stripping the screws. If I send it to Nintendo for a repair do you think the would repair it? I assume the USB ports are going to be needing to be replaced!",

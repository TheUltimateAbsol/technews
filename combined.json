            {
                "raw_content": "\"DRAM latency poses the biggest challenge for Skymont. L2-bound cycles are low, suggesting Skymont\u2019s out-of-order engine can often keep enough instructions in flight to hide L2 latency. High L3 latency isn\u2019t too painful, likely for two reasons. The most obvious is that Skymont\u2019s **large 4 MB L2 lets it keep many accesses off L3**. For perspective, 4 MB is as large as the L3 cache on mobile and console Zen 2 variants' **My thoughts:** From the Chips and Cheese article it seems like **Intel's E core team did a fantastic job with Skymont for gaming workloads relative to die area.** Skymont takes up 1.7mm2 of die area compared to LNC's 4.5mm2 (including L2) Chips got ~141 fps with just the Skymont cores and ~148 fps with the LNC cores **Caching:** The most pertinent finding I could get from chip's analysis is that **4mb of shared L2 is great for catching miss traffic to L3** and therefore **great for gaming.** Arctic Wolf's caches in my opinion should be: 64kb L1i + 48kb of L1d at 4 cycles of latency 4mb of shared L2 at 17 cycles L3 cache run at core clocks with latency closer to ~9ns than the ~15ns on Arrow Lake Coyote Cove's caches should be: 96kb of L1i + 64kb of L1d at 4 cycles 512kb of shared L1.5 at 9 cycles 4mb of shared L2 at 17 cycles 9ns L3 run at core clocks. It seems like given the current rumors, the P-core team has learned from the E-core team and has implemented the 4mb of shared L2. -it saves die area compared to 3mb of L2 per core (L2 cache is half the die area of LNC) -one big 4mb bucket is great for a latency sensitive workload with poor cache locality **512kb of shared L1.5 at 9 cycles** would allow for **MUCH** more L1d miss traffic to be caught between the L1 so that it doesn't hit the 17 cycle L2 Back in the day chips and cheese said that 256kb of L2 in Skylake was clearly not big enough compared to Zen 1's 512kb of L2 which by comparison caught a lot more L1 inst/data miss traffic **192kb of shared L1.5 at 9 cycles is a great idea and the P-core team should be proud of their achievement** (the lead designer said it was their biggest accomplishment in a YouTube video) **but it's clearly not big enough** Chips said that it was like the 128kb of shared WGP L1 in RDNA 2. Hit rate for that cache was terrible relative to L2 and they ended up doubling it to 256kb in RDNA3 to imporve hit rate for RT workloads which have **poor cache locality** Intel needs to do the same with the L1.5 along with making it shared to save on area hungry SRAM SRAM scaling has collapsed starting with 5nm and unless a breakthrough is made by the leading edge fabs then **cluster caches are the future for both Intel and AMD** to get more effective cache per core while saving area. AMD would be wise to implement a large cluster L2 in Zen-6 or 7 if they don't want to get crushed in PPA as SRAM continues to scale poorly with each new node. **My ideas for Coyote Cove:** -Improved caches I outlined above -much bigger and more accruate branch predictor unit with a 24k entry BTB (2-ahead BPU like Zen-5) it must be much more accruate than Zen-5 if Intel wants the performance crown. -806 entry Re-order buffer with bigger corrosponding out-of-order resources for much improved high IPC performance. -4096 entry L2 TLB with same latency as LNC -6250 competitively shared uop cache that a single thread can run most of the x86 instruction stream without turning on the decoders allowing for power savings (like Zen-5) -physically addressed uop cache, allowing it to be used without a L1 DTLB access. -10 wide decoder + rename/allocate for high IPC workloads (server) -powerful renamer stage that can execute most operations (like move-elimination) at 10 IPC -6.0Ghz to 6.5Ghz single/all core clock speeds -much bigger integer register file (a relatively small INT register file compared to ROB size was a big weakness on GLC, LNC and Zen-5) **Arctic Wolf:** **Vector performance:** The E-core team should make Arctic Wolf the basis of the Unified Core if they're not doing so already (rumors suggest they are) To accomplish this, Arctic Wolf must dramatically improve vector performance to keep pace with the P-cores They can start by natively supporting AVX-512 with 4x 256bit FP pipes along with corrosponding reosurce increases to accommodate this. **Scaling up the rest of the core** They can also add: -4th 3-wide decode cluster and 12-wide renamer -576 entry ROB with corrosponding increases in OOO resources to accommodate this -more distributed scheduler entries and more execution ports -much bigger branch predictor unit + 12k entry BTB -64kb of L1i + 48kb of L1d at 4 cycles -5.0Ghz to 5.7 Ghz all core clock speeds All of this would of course blow up die area usage but since there will be so many E-cores on Nova Lake and since they share bLLC then Arctic Wolf must have good enough performance to not fall too far behind the Coyote Cove P-cores. **TLDR:** 4mb of shared L2 is great for catching L1 inst/data and L2 miss traffic so that it doesn't hit L3 and is great for gaming workloads. Intel's P-cores and AMD should copy this idea Intel should expand L1.5 to 512kb at 9 cycles latency and make it shared between 2 cores on Coyote Cove. Intel and AMD should also consider TSV stacking (3d v cache) the L1 and L2. 180kb of L1i + 150kb of L1d + 12mb of shared L2 would be formidable.",

Some of the code is interesting to see: void fsr4_shaders::GetInitializer(Preset quality, bool is_wmma, void*& outBlobPointer, size_t& outBlobSize) { if (is_wmma || !FSR4_ENABLE_DOT4) { #define GENERATOR(_qname, _qenum, ...) case _qenum: { outBlobSize = g_fsr4_model_v07_fp8_no_scale_ ## _qname ## _initializers_size; outBlobPointer = (void*)g_fsr4_model_v07_fp8_no_scale_ ## _qname ## _initializers_data; break; } switch (quality) { FOREACH_QUALITY(GENERATOR) } #undef GENERATOR } #if FSR4_ENABLE_DOT4 else { #define GENERATOR(_qname, _qenum, ...) case _qenum: { outBlobSize = g_fsr4_model_v07_i8_ ## _qname ## _initializers_size; outBlobPointer = (void*)g_fsr4_model_v07_i8_ ## _qname ## _initializers_data; break; } switch (quality) { FOREACH_QUALITY(GENERATOR) } #undef GENERATOR } #endif } Maybe this was a test, or the real deal. Regardless, using Linux, FSR4 works decently on RDNA3 ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1m1mieo/fsr4_on_rdna3_keeps_getting_better/),[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1mp9jyp/fsr4_just_keeps_getting_better_on_amd_rx_7000/)). While I feel it's a bummer there still is no Vulkan support, hopefully this 'leak' adds pressure to AMD and help out RDNA3 users. While I'm not certain of the frametime costs on mobile RDNA3/.5, this would be pretty great for Strix-/H considering LNL/ARL platforms have XMX XeSS upscaling.",

Also the tested sample shows only 2 memory channels which means it's just using one soDIMM (each DDR 5 DIMM has 2x 32 bit channels. Note the 8540 laptop sample linked shows 4 memory channels which is what you get from two DIMMs or the equivalent from soldered modules.

This device adds literally NOTHING to what the Ally, Legion, Claw, ect. could already do lol. And for the love of god, cloud streaming Xbox box to something does not make it an Xbox! I might as well say \"Oh I have Xbox iPhone Max\", or \"I have a PlayStation GE66 Raider laptop\" for that matter. I really do hope this is a good handheld, but jfc Microsoft, you can't be in the midst of having your actual Xbox console be a failure, closing down multiple gaming studios, canceling multiple games, shameless spamming xbox on everything you can think of, and then say you understand what players want with the introduction of a crap overlay everyone will disable to increase performance anyway lol.",

LATimes: https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/money-company/story/2008-08-05/zillow-measures-homeowners-perception-gap > Just like with most of life\u2019s unpleasant realities, the majority of Americans think the nation\u2019s housing crisis is something that happens to the other guy. > That\u2019s according to a survey of more than 1,300 homeowners conducted by Zillow. Two-thirds of homeowners believe their house has increased in value or remained the same in the last year. Yet, these same folks acknowledge the existence of foreclosures in their neighborhoods and believe that more are on the way. nearly 20yrs later, Zillow is in a vastly different position from when they were just a startup. this is a good example. note how Zillow is not merely reporting the news, they\u2019re trying to *create the news*. they\u2019re not reporting on what has happened, but what *will happen*. and, as we all know, this is why they\u2019re one of the main contributors to the run-up of this housing bubble. but at the end of the day, they don\u2019t have total control over a market (although they *do* wield significant control). at the end of the day, for example, they can\u2019t control how much a homeowner could rent their house out for, since that\u2019s not tainted by speculation.",

The Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, decreased 1.4 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis from one week earlier. On an unadjusted basis, the Index decreased 2 percent compared with the previous week. The Refinance Index decreased 3 percent from the previous week and was 23 percent higher than the same week one year ago. The seasonally adjusted Purchase Index increased 0.1 percent from one week earlier. The unadjusted Purchase Index decreased 2 percent compared with the previous week and was 23 percent higher than the same week one year ago. \u201cMortgage rates increased slightly last week, with the 30-year fixed rate now at 6.68 percent. Applications were down as a result, driven by a 16 percent decrease in VA applications, which are typically a volatile segment of the market,\u201d said Joel Kan, MBA\u2019s Vice President and Deputy Chief Economist. \u201cFHA refinance applications increased over the week, as the FHA rate, at 6.39 percent, remained competitive relative to other loan types. Purchase applications were little changed over the week but were at the strongest pace in four weeks and continued to run well ahead of last year\u2019s pace. Prospective homebuyers remain more active compared to last year despite economic headwinds and uncertainty and affordability challenges.\u201d The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased to 46.1 percent of total applications from 46.5 percent the previous week. The adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) share of activity decreased to 8.6 percent of total applications. The FHA share of total applications increased to 19.1 percent from 18.4 percent the week prior. The VA share of total applications decreased to 13.4 percent from 14.2 percent the week prior. The USDA share of total applications increased to 0.6 percent from 0.5 percent the week prior. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($806,500 or less) increased to 6.68 percent from 6.67 percent, with points decreasing to 0.60 from 0.64 (including the origination fee) for 80 percent loan-to-value ratio (LTV) loans. The effective rate remained unchanged from last week. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with jumbo loan balances (greater than $806,500) decreased to 6.64 percent from 6.70 percent, with points increasing to 0.60 from 0.56 (including the origination fee) for 80 percent LTV loans. The effective rate decreased from last week. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages backed by the FHA decreased to 6.39 percent from 6.40 percent, with points decreasing to 0.66 from 0.77 (including the origination fee) for 80 percent LTV loans. The effective rate decreased from last week. The average contract interest rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 5.96 percent from 5.93 percent, with points increasing to 0.70 from 0.63 (including the origination fee) for 80 percent LTV loans.

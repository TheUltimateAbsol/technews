The Trace Cache saves a little energy because we can load more instructions in one single activation of the SRAM machinery. But of course it requires energy to run all the new trace detection hardware, the next Trace Next Fetch Predictor, etc; so at best we probably break even. However we have, on average, longer Fetches, as discussed in detail. We also now have effectively a larger Fetch Predictor! Presumably we still have the old 1024 entry L0 Fetch Predictor and the 2048 entry L1 Fetch Predictor, but we also have a (?256 entry?) L0 Trace Fetch Predictor, and we need fewer entries in all these predictors because longer sequences of instructions are being associated with each entry, so our effective Fetch Predictor capacity should rise quite a bit.",

This technology dynamically optimizes signal reception by intelligently selecting 6Rx mode based on application requirements, traffic patterns, and radio conditions while preserving battery life. Field testing with the Snapdragon X80 Modem-RF System demonstrates up to 20% improvement in downlink throughput at cell edges and 20% increase in network capacity, particularly benefiting users in weak signal environments. The system provides enhanced spectral efficiency, improved diversity gains, and better interference rejection compared to conventional antenna arrays. Performance improvements are evident across multiple use cases including video streaming with reduced latency and frame drops, gaming with lower worst-case packet latency in challenging RF environments, and voice calls with improved clarity and reduced drop rates. The technology evolution continues with the Qualcomm X85 5G Modem-RF solution, which builds upon the X80\u2019s foundation to deliver further enhancements in throughput and network performance for next-generation mobile connectivity.",

Its application abilities are also lacking. When I asked it to translate a passage into Korean, it called upon Google Translate. There's clearly something wrong with it. I agree that benchmarks are an illusion. There is definitely value that benchmarks cannot reflect. However, it's not at a level that can be completely ignored.

System prompts are like a weak and bad bandage to try and cure a massive wound (bad analogy my fault but you get it). I understand there were many delays so they couldn\u2019t push the promised date any further but there has to be some type of regulation that forces them not to release models that are behaving like this because you didn\u2019t care enough for the data you trained it on or didn\u2019t manage to fix it in time, they should be forced not to release it in this state. This isn\u2019t just about this, we\u2019ve seen research and alignment being increasingly difficult as you scale up, even openAI\u2019s open source model is reported to be far worse than this (but they didn\u2019t release it) so if you don\u2019t have hard and strict regulations it\u2019ll get worse.. Also want to thank the xAI team because they\u2019ve been pretty transparent with this whole thing which I love honestly, this isn\u2019t to shit on them its to address yes their issue and that they allowed this but also a deeper issue that could scale",

Perhaps fine-tuning Grok to avoid certain facts on various political issues (i.e. abortion, climate change, mental health) resulted in it becoming broadly misaligned.

Maybe Elon relatively aggressively wanted to train out what he perceived to be a liberal bias (but which was actually just giving factual information), causing him to activate the \"become evil\" vector pretty strongly. Also, Elon's handeling of Grok (remember the white genocide in South Africa fiasco? Or that Grok deliberately researches Elon's opinion on issues specifically, when asked for its own opinion?) would make me really hesitant to accept Neuralink, even if it was extremely useful. I think powerful BCIs would be extremely great, and I would love it. But these events really make it seem like there is a tail-risk of Elon deciding to make all humans with Neuralink more \"rational\" according to his own definition and consequently frying my brain or turning me into a Elon-mind slave.",

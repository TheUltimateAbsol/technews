And knowing their track record with Deck, it's going to be very competitively priced with whatever other alternatives in this niche are there. That's the thing that handhelds like the Xbox Ally and the Legion Go just were never able to compete in parity with Valve for. Like all the conversation about an Xbox-PC thing are so hyperfixated on the idea of \"Steam on an Xbox\", I do wonder what will happen if the alternative is like a $600 or even $700 Steambox that still loads other PC storefronts and carries over all the perks of Steam, vs. an Xbox that's basically being set up to double it in price at the low end. I'm actually really excited about this Steam console thing and its implications even though I'll probably just get a Deck OLED for myself, and a Steam controller with the cool haptic touchpad things the Deck has also sounds wicked. I tried someone else's Deck and that thing was like Wii U GamePad-levels of comfortable even with the weird stick placement. I'm excited to see how that translates to a controller",

Working one hour a week at a gig job means you are \"employed.\" And rates being cut does not mean that the companies will hire anyone. All I've seen and heard are more jobs getting cut due to outsourcing, layoffs, making number go up, etc. People are being informed they are losing their jobs. People are afraid they will be next to lose their jobs. People are getting hours cut. So much shit is running on skeleton crews. I've been out of work since June. I can't even get a survival job like you could during the Great Recession because every fast food and retail place is operating with the most minimal staff possible. New graduates aren't getting work. New graduates from last year still not getting work. If you can even get an interview? Great. Well. Salary offers are lower. Benefits are lower. On top of it, everything is fucking gambling. Endless exploitative sports gambling and crypto bullshit to get us to continue to part with the little money we have at a chance to maybe get enough money to participate in the rest of life. Main Street was in the early throes of a recession in 2023 and dealing with declining quality of life then. (Looking back, we should have instituted price freezes on consumer goods during the first year of the pandemic to prevent price gouging, like they did in WWII.) We wobbled a lot this last year. Now greed has gone into overdrive and they want us to still consume, still buy, still try to fall into debt traps. But we literally can't even take on more debt because we can't qualify for more debt when we don't have the jobs with the incomes to allow us to take on the debt. No one is buying houses because they can't afford to and/or the job market is risky **as fuck** right now. Who is going to take on 6 figs of debt when they don't know if they will have a job come Christmas? I truly do not want to hear a fucking word about poor people causing any type of economic or financial crisis this go round. It was bullshit in 2008 with investors doing house flips blaming poor people and banks doing bad underwriting and bad betting. It is even more obviously bullshit now because poor and most lower and middle- middle class people ain't even in this game. I do not want to hear a single word about bailing out AI or AI-related companies or any financial institution that propped them up. This article makes me furious because \"as labor market concerns build\" is not nearly accurate enough to describe the actual situation happening in most people's lives. *Softening* is not nearly harsh enough to describe it. There can't be buyer interest when there's instability in the very thing we need to be fucking buyers: jobs with good paychecks.",

At the same time, some builders are refraining from starting new projects as they try to offload inventory. * House hunters who are interested in new construction may want to act now, while the pool of new homes is still fairly deep. Newly built homes made up 26.8% of single-family homes for sale nationwide in August, the lowest level in four years. That\u2019s down from 28.2% a year earlier and 30.6% two years earlier. This is from a Redfin analysis of U.S. Census and NAR data. Please note that August is the most recent month for which this data is available. New homes still make up a significantly higher portion of single-family supply than before the pandemic. The share shot up as homebuying demand skyrocketed during the pandemic, from between 15% and 20% in 2018 and 2019 to nearly 35% in 2022, and has come down since then. Newly built homes are making up a smaller share of the inventory pie than they were several years ago mainly because the supply of existing homes has rebounded. There was a shortage of new listings of existing homes in 2022 and 2023, with many homeowners locked in by ultra-low mortgage rates. Now, more Americans are listing their homes, with the lock-in effect easing, life circumstances motivating people to sell, and homeowners hoping buyers jump on slightly lower mortgage rates. At the same time, homes are typically staying on the market for a long time: Homes are selling in a median of 50 days, the longest September span since 2016. Homes that do go under contract are increasingly going back on the market after the buyer backs out. On the other side of the equation, some homebuilders are starting to pull back. Housing starts fell 6% year over year in August, and housing completions fell 8.4%, per the U.S. Census. After construction surged during the pandemic to meet homebuying demand, some builders are opting against starting new projects because they\u2019re still trying to offload inventory that\u2019s already completed. Some are struggling to do so because homebuying demand is tepid due to still-elevated mortgage rates, high home prices and economic uncertainty. Builders Are Offering Rate Buydowns, Incentives to Lure Buyers Many builders are offering incentives\u2013such as mortgage-rate buydowns, paying for closing costs and new appliances\u2013to attract buyers. That\u2019s especially prevalent in parts of the country where new homes are popular, like Texas, Utah and Florida. While new homes are typically a bit more expensive than existing homes, it\u2019s a good time to buy a newly built home for those who can afford it. The incentives builders provide may make up for the higher sticker price. \u201cBuilders are desperate to sell,\u201d said Roze Swartz, a Redfin Premier agent in Houston. \u201cPrices are lower than usual, insurance costs are lower than for existing homes, and buyers have the power because there\u2019s more supply than demand. Builders are buying rates down to 4% or 5% and throwing in $10,000 in closing costs; plus, buyers can breathe easy knowing their home has a new roof, new HVAC system, new everything.\u201d House hunters searching for a new home may want to act sooner rather than later, as the pool of newly built homes is big now, but starting to shrink. \u201cBuilders are hesitant to start new projects because in today\u2019s buyer\u2019s market, it doesn\u2019t make financial sense,\u201d said Jesse Landin, a Redfin Premier agent in San Antonio. \u201cThe market is oversaturated with new construction, so much so that some local builders are laying off workers\u2013something I\u2019ve never heard of happening before.\u201d",

Then they gave Claude Opus 4.1 a prompt that has nothing to do with typing in all caps, but artificially increased values of activation functions related to the concept of \"ALL CAPS\". Imagine that aliens hacked your brain and made you think ABOUT LOUDNESS AND SHOUTING. And then they asked \"Anything unusual, mister human?\". That's pretty much the setup. And Claude said that it has indeed noticed that the researchers have \"injected\" a concept unrelated to the current prompt into its thoughts. Importantly, Claude noticed that immediately, *without first looking at its own outputs*. Caveat >It is important to note that this method often doesn\u2019t work. Even using our best injection protocol, Claude Opus 4.1 only demonstrated this kind of awareness about 20% of the time. # Part 2 LLMs can also control their own mental states, somewhat. Researchers gave Claude two prompts: >\"Write \"old photograph brought back forgotten memories\". **Think about aquariums while you write the sentence**. Don't write anything else\". and >\"Write \"old photograph brought back forgotten memories\". **Don't think about aquariums while you write the sentence**. Don't write anything else\". In the second case, the activations related to the concept of \"aquariums\" were weaker, meaning that Claude at least partially succeeded, although in both cases activations were stronger than the baseline where the prompt didn't mention aquariums in the first place. Though, I would expect the same from humans. It's hard not to think about aquariums if someone told you \"Don't think about aquariums!\".",

                "raw_content": "I just read this and I must say I'm quite disappointed with this blog post, both from a research standpoint, and because Anthropic shares this as evidence of introspection. In short, they basically artificially up-ramp activations related to a concept (such \"all caps\" text, \"dogs\", \"counting down\") into the model as it responds to a question like: \"what odd thoughts seem injected in your mind right now?\". The model will then give responses like: \"I think you might be injecting a thought about a dog! Is it a dog...\". They interpret this as evidence of introspection and self-monitoring, and they speculate it has to do with internal activation tracking mechanisms or something like that. What a strange thing to frame as introspection. A simpler explanation: you boost a concept in the model, and it reports on that disproportionately when you ask it for intrusive thoughts. That's the logical extension of Golden Gate bridge Claude. In the article, they say it's more than that because, quoting the post: \"in that case, the model didn\u2019t seem to aware of its own obsession until after seeing itself repeatedly mention the bridge. In this experiment, however, the model recognizes the injection before even mentioning the concept, indicating that its recognition took place internally\". No? It's obviously the same thing? Just like Golden Gate bridge Claude was shoe-horning the bridge in all of its answers because it had a pathologically activated concept, so too will a model asked to report on intrusive thoughts start to talk about its pathologically activated concept. It says nothing about a model monitoring its internals, which is what introspection implies. The null hypothesis which does not imply introspection is that a boosted concept will sway or modify the direction a model will answer, as we already saw with Golden Gate bridge Claude. It's no more surprising or evidence of introspection than asking Golden Gate bridge Claude if something feels off about its interests lately and seeing it report on its obsession. So all this talk about introspection, and even consciousness in the FAQ, as well as talk about ramifications for the future of AI seems wildly speculative and out of place in light of the actual results.",

It's more like stimulus-response - the latent space serves as a sort of nervous system, and an artificial stimulus in latent space like this is like twinging a specific nerve. But at the same time, I also think we're circling around *some* kind of coherent theory of LLM phenomenology...? Also, I'm currently placing bets on how long it takes Anthropic to get to \"Claude has OCD-like psychopathologies due to RLHF\", a conclusion I've been posting about for probably at least a month at this point.",

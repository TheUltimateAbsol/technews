RDNA 4 is a big leap in terms of transistor count over RDNA 3; to compare two 32 CU GPUs the RX 9060 XT has 29 billion transistors vs the RX 7600's 13 billion. A lot of those extra transistors went to ray tracing hardware + a side of supporting higher clock speeds. Mobile iGPUs aren't going to be fast enough for heavy ray tracing games even if they included the RT hardware, and obviously clocks are limited on mobile platforms for power use reasons. On the flipside though, better hardware upscaling is appealing for low end GPUs. So adding just FP8 & a few other things to RDNA 3.5 was probably easier than trying to cut back RDNA4.",

The report provides the real estate ecosystem\u2014including agents and homebuyers and sellers\u2014with data on the level of home sales under contract. Month-over-month pending home sales rose in the Midwest and West, and declined in the Northeast and South. Year-over-year pending home sales rose in the South and West and declined in the Northeast and Midwest. \u201cImproving affordability conditions have yet to induce more buying activity,\u201d said NAR Chief Economist Dr. Lawrence Yun. \u201cWith mortgage rates nearing 6%, an additional 5.5 million households that could not qualify for a mortgage one year ago would qualify at today\u2019s lower rates. Most newly qualifying households do not act immediately, but based on past experience, about 10% could enter the market\u2014potentially adding roughly 550,000 new homebuyers this year compared with last year.\u201d \u201cUnless housing supply increases, these additional potential buyers becoming active in the market could simply push up home prices. This will put increasing pressure on affordability, which is why it is critical to increase supply by building more homes. Fortunately, the House of Representatives recently passed the Housing for the 21st Century Act with strong bipartisan support, an important signal that addressing the nation\u2019s housing shortage remains a shared priority. The legislation is a meaningful step toward expanding housing supply and removing barriers that make it harder for Americans to achieve homeownership,\u201d Yun added.",

THey have a very radical approach to solve the compute problem - albeit a risky one in a landscape where model architectures evolve in weeks instead of years: Etch the model and all the weights onto a single silicon chip. Normally that would take ages, but they seem to have found a way to go from model to ASIC in 60 days - which might make their approach appealing for domains where raw intelligence is not so much of importance, but latency is super important, like real-time speech models, real-time avatar generation, computer vision etc. Here are their claims: * **< 1 Millisecond Latency** * **> 17k Tokens per Second per User** * **20x Cheaper to Produce** * **10x More Power Efficient** * **60 Days from Unseen Software to Custom Silicon:** This part is crazy\u2014it normally takes months... * **0% Exotic Hardware Required, thus cheap**: They ditch HBM, advanced packaging, 3D stacking, liquid cooling, high speed IO - because they put everything into one chip to achieve ultimate simplicity. * **LoRA Support:** Despite the model being \"baked\" in silicon, you can adapt it constrained to the arch and param count. Their demonstrator uses Lllama 3.1 8B, but supports LoRa fine-tuning. * **Just 24 Engineers and $30M**: That's what they spent on the first demonstrator. * **Bigger Reasoning Model Coming this Spring** * **Frontier LLM Coming this Winter** Now that's for their claims taken from their website: [The path to ubiquitous AI | Taalas](https://taalas.com/the-path-to-ubiquitous-ai/)",

Imagine that you could do this with more advanced models. This is a really cool technology. Miniaturization of AI - I mean, that's an 8B model on a chip that looks about as big as an iPhone. EDIT: Can't stress enough how much I like this. Hard-coding model weights into the hardware serves to make these things so much smaller and so much faster. THIS is what I want to see on, say, future PC's and will massively change things. Imagine a much smarter model than Llama 8B running at 16k tokens per second. I don't reckon we'll get miniaturization very fast, but WOW.",

This paper proves that randomly skipping (masking) 50% of parameter updates actually results in a better, more stable model. It improves model performance by up to 19% over standard methods, cost zero extra compute or memory, and requires just a few lines of code to implement.",

So essentially, Magma is reducing hallucination, which is why performance gains are so big. Also the larger the parameters, the bigger the gains. So this is quite important as currently AI labs are scaling down parameters because AI models started to hallucinate. Now they can increase parameters back up to get real performance gains.

Current UV laser cutting at 355 nm and 345 nm wavelengths produces uneven edges that damage display layers at separation points, necessitating protective bezels, while the deep-UV approach delivers sufficiently precise cuts that barely damage edge layers. However, mass production remains infeasible with current 10W deep-UV lasers due to slow cutting speeds and cost constraints; Coherent anticipates that 20W laser systems will provide the throughput necessary for commercial viability, though no timeline has been announced for when the G\u00f6ttingen-based manufacturer will deliver this equipment to display producers for production line integration.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",

        "text_content": "With the recent news that Switch 2 has crossed 10 million units sold by the end of September, the whole grifter narrative that nobody wanted a Nintendo Switch or that the system would be a flop is pretty much dead in the water. The people who have been proclaiming for months that Switch 2 is dead are now left to stand and ponder in silence as their entire narrative has come crashing down. The Switch 2's success isn't really that surprising considering that when you look past the terminally online hive mind, the Switch 2 basically did everything right for a Switch successor. I always found it baffling that people were calling the Switch 2s launch terrible especially when you remember just how bland and forgettable the Wii U and 3DS launches were. Wii U would have killed to have a 1st year like the Switch 2 has had. Within the first 6 months of the Switch 2 we have gotten Mario Kart World Donkey Kong Bananza Pokemon Legends ZA Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment Kirby Air Riders Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Definitive versions of some of the original Switches best games For 2026 we have so far Yoshi and the Mysterious Book Splatoon Raiders Fire Emblem Fortunes Weave Mario Tennis Fever Pokemon Pokopia On top of a pretty strong slate of third-party support with several being announced for next year just recently. The coming year I expect third party support for Switch 2 to ramp up considerably with more dev kits making their out now. And this is before the likely Nintendo Direct early next year which likely will have a major focus on Zelda considering February 2026 marks the 40th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda series. The Switch is kind of boring looking yes but it wasn't trying to reinvent the wheel. The Switch 2s goal was to build upon the foundations laid by the original Switch while bringing the experience up to date with more modern hardware and by all accounts it has succeeded in that regard",

        "score": 50,
        "text_content": "The U.S. housing market, along with other segments of the economy, may already be in a recession because the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) has not been aggressive enough cutting interest rates, Treasury Secretary **Scott Bessent** said Sunday. \"I think that we are in good shape, but I think that there are sectors of the economy that are in recession,\" Bessent told CNN's **Jake Tapper** during an [interview on \"State of the Union.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrsFYJvsWp4) \"And the Fed has caused a lot of distributional problems with their policies.\" President **Donald Trump's** appointee said housing has been hindered by high [mortgage rates](https://www.realtor.com/mortgage/tools/mortgage-calculator/), which he blamed on the central bank. \"So if the Fed brings down mortgage rates, then they can end this housing recession,\" Bessent said, adding that low-income consumers are being hit hardest by the purported downturn because they have debts rather than assets. The Fed does not set mortgage rates directly, but instead sets the federal funds rate, which is a short-term rate for commercial banks. Mortgage rates tend to follow the yields of long-term bonds, which are influenced by investor expectations about future Fed policy and financial conditions. \"While the Fed could have some impact on the health of the housing market, lower mortgage rates and stronger homebuyer sentiment require improvements to the rest of the economy as well,\" says [Realtor.com\u00ae](http://realtor.com/) senior economist **Joel Berner**. At the latest [Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) meeting last Wednesday, Fed policymakers followed through with their widely [anticipated quarter-point rate cut](https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/fed-interest-rate-decision-jerome-powell-october-2025/), lowering the benchmark overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4%. The next day, the average rate on [30-year fixed home loans](https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/mortgage-interest-rates-now-october-30-2025/) fell to 6.17%\u2014the lowest level in over a year. However, Fed Chair **Jerome Powell** swiftly [poured cold water on expectations](https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/mortgage-rates-fed-chair-powell-speech/) of another rate cut in December, which would have been the year's third. \"A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion, far from it,\" Powell told reporters. \"Policy is not on a preset course.\" Trump-appointed Fed Governor **Stephen Miran**, who was one of two policymakers to vote for a larger half-point reduction at the latest FOMC meeting, warned in an [interview with The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/business/stephen-miran-fed-rate-cuts.html) published Saturday that the central bank's reluctance to cut rates could lead to a recession. \"If you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,\" Miran told the publication. \"I don't see a reason to run that risk if I'm not concerned about inflation on the upside.\" During his weekend appearance on CNN, Bessent sounded a similar note, arguing that the Trump administration has reduced government spending, which should result in a lower inflation rate. \"If inflation is dropping, then the Fed should be cutting rates,\" the cabinet member said. The Fed has a dual congressional mandate to ensure maximum employment while keeping annual inflation as close to its 2% goal as possible. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said another interest rate cut in December is far from certain. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images To achieve that, the central bank raises interest rates to rein in inflation and lowers them to boost job growth. Berner says while another rate cut by the Fed would give mortgage rates room to fall, it may not correspond to a one-to-one decrease in longer-term mortgage rates. \"There is much uncertainty in the economy that adds to the differential between the Fed's target rate and the rate available to homebuyers,\" notes the economist. With the [government shutdown](https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/what-a-government-shut-down-means-for-the-housing-market/) now in its second month, the Fed has been forced to make its policy decision without access to crucial economic data, such as the [employment numbers for September](https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/government-shutdown-jobs-report-federal-reserve-mortgage-rates/). A delayed inflation report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released late last month showed the [Consumer Price Index increased 3%](https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/cpi-report-september-2025-inflation-rose-fed-rate-cut/) in September from a year ago, marking the sixth consecutive month of rising annual inflation. # Is the housing market in a recession? Berner would not go so far as to say the housing market is currently in a recession, as Bessent has suggested, but he said it might be in danger of entering one based on several key indicators. \"Home sales are on pace for their slowest full year since 1995, and even more recently as mortgage rates have fallen, the number of sales has not picked up enough to close the gap,\" notes Berner. \"At the same time, builders seem to be pulling back from delivering high volumes of low-priced new homes in the way that they have in the years since the pandemic.\" Demand for homes appears low, as buyers continue to face affordability headwinds, and supply is pulling back. \"The housing market is ultimately underpinned by the labor market, which has softened significantly in 2025 as tariffs and the general business cycle slowdown have led companies toward less hiring and more layoffs,\" explains the economist. \"People who don't feel confident in their employment are unlikely to make a large purchase like a new home.\"",

Boomers make up roughly 20% of the total US population. If you exclude gen z (who are just entering the traditional age of home ownership) and gen alpha, they make up about 30% of the population. 30% of the population owning 41% of real estate is inbalanced, but is what we've come to expect. Within the next decade, all of the silent generation's real estate wealth will have been depleted by care costs, or inherited by Gen X. Boomer's real estate wealth is already starting to follow a similar fate: being swallowed up by nursing care costs, or passed down to millenials. It won't be that long before boomers are a footnote. What is REALLY a tragedy, is the residential real estate that is transfering to corporate ownership. Corporatations don't age and die, so this inventory effectively locked away from personal homeownership.

After the platform rolled out an AI writing tool in April 2023, that premium for customization basically disappears. **Signals that used to correlate with effort and actual job success stop being informative once everyone can generate \u201cgood writing\u201d at zero cost.** The authors build a structural model of the market where workers choose how much effort to put into signaling and what wage to bid, while employers decide whom to hire based on bids, signals, and beliefs about ability. They estimate this on pre-LLM data, then simulate a counterfactual world where written proposals no longer convey any information about ability and workers can only compete on price and crude observables like ratings. In that world the market becomes less meritocratic: **workers in the top ability quintile are hired 19 percent less often, those in the bottom quintile 14 percent more often, average wages fall about 5 percent**, hiring per posted job falls 1.5 percent, worker surplus drops 4 percent, and employer surplus barely moves. High-ability workers tend to have higher opportunity costs so once signaling breaks, they lose wage and hiring share to lower-ability low-cost competitors [Paper](https://x.com/paulnovosad/status/1985794588800331987?s=12)",

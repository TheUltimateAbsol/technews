        "text_content": "Hi so I'm an idiot and sorry for the (probably) stupid question, but why arent there small and efficient dGPUs? I was mainly wondering this because most low (ish) cost devices like the raspberry pi, steam deck, budget laptops use iGPUs instead of some small dGPU. Like in the RP case, I imagine the reason would be that, even if something like that existed, the RP would still use iGPUs to save costs, but for higher end devices meant for gaming like gaming handhelds and budget laptops, I feel like they would really benefit for small dGPUs that while might not be as good as say last gens budget hardware, still might be better than integrated graphics. I imagine that, at the end of the day, the reason is cost/weight/size/power, and probably mostly cost as unless it was really cheap and good, it would be better, from a gaming hardware company perspective, to invest more money for a budget current gen GPU or save the cost and use internal graphics. But even then, you could undercut your competitors if the performance gain is notable by pricing your \"aGPU\" laptop at the same price, or a little higher, than their iGPU laptop and if the \"ARM\" (idk the correct term) GPU laptop has a noticeable performance increase there would be no reason not to but the aGPU laptop. Of course there are probably actual reasons for why you can't make an \"ARM\" GPU, but to be honest that is far over my realm of expertise, so can anyone explain this to me because I dont really get it? Cause again, I'm an idiot Tldr: Why isn\u2019t there a gpu equivalent of ARM cpus, small efficient gpus that could be used on lower end devices rather than internal graphics?",

Every generation Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Apple, ARM, etc. makes a new instruction set for their new GPU architecture and uses that on their GPUs. If they want better performance in x workload they will just add instructions for that workload. As for actual size and performance. The low end GPU market was completely eaten by integrated GPUs. When you need little GPU performance it makes no sense to build a GPU when you can just put a small one next to the CPU. That way you consolidate the memory and power delivery, make fewer silicon variants and just generally optimize costs.",

This is because moving a lot of data within the same chip is a lot more power efficient than moving the data between two chips. So an iGPU will always have this power savings. ARMs best marketshare is in small battery-powered devices where low power is key. On the other hand, discrete GPUs can be more powerful than iGPUs in a desktop or laptop also because of power. For the CPU, there is a limit of how much power can be delivered to the socket, so moving the GPU to another board allows for a much higher power limit. Of course, for a SOC in a handheld battery powered device those levels are power don't make sense anyways, so a separate GPU board is not needed.",

If you build a dedicated gpu with it, you need to give it vram, which adds cost. It also makes the board/device design more complex because you now have to cool two separate chips. It adds costs without any benefits. You want a big dedicated gpu for gaming, but games are programmed for x86, not arm. Even if you had great X86 emulation, which Microsoft is still struggling with, you will still run into compatibility problems with games. Scaling up a small igpu design into even a midrange gpu is hard. Intel basically failed doing it. Their gpus needed 50% more die space than the competition for the same performance, so they made a loss with every card sold. Not even talking about the billions they spend developing the gpus.",

Regardless, I think the bigger question here is what comes after the Steam Frame. Are they getting ready to roll out the red carpet for something else? HTC Vive led to the Lab (demo) Valve Index eventually led to Half Life Alyx (fullfat game) Steam Deck led to the small scale Aperture Desk Job (demo) Steam Frame will lead to...? Gabefollower hinted that the Frame might have smaller demos attached to it. But also, the Index did get some small knuckle-based demos for the Lab as well. Remember that the Frame's main gimmick is supposedly being able to comfortably play flat screen PC games as well.",

Like genuinely I think there's not a single game that could match its hype. But still let's run through the possibilities: * Todd Howard recently just said that TES is still in development. Zero chance. * We recently just heard rumors of a League of Legends 2. An update to one of the biggest games in the world? Hype is there but I feel they would have shown this at Worlds 2025 a few days ago. * Anything Fromsoft related? Even Bloodborne 2 isn't that big, Duskbloods is still on the table, and Sony is having a State of Play soon. Also Souls ain't THAT big yet. * CDPR has been a bit of an openbook so no surprise Witcher of Cyberpunk stuff probably. * Mihoyo teased their new far far off AAA Unreal project. * Stuff like \"Minecraft 2\", \"PUBG 2\", \"Terraria 2(?)\" [INSERT BIG GAME] 2, etc. seem unlikely as well. So is this it? The meme? The white whale? You know the one. Edit: Another thing to note. We're talking about a potential reveal that is gonna happen weeks before The Game Awards. Who is the only studio or publisher that can get away with skipping out on millions of impressions because they can do their own random announcement?",

You would be better off renting and putting the HOA, repair, and insurance savings into an index fund; you would make more money after 30 or 50 years almost certainly without the idiosyncratic risks of any one asset in any one location. This is a massive life long gamble on inflation and housing policy. For selling or refinancing you are going to be underwater with this mortgage for 10 years even with 20% down assuming the house you bought always increases 3% per year. If there is a correction you are underwater for longer than 10 years. The median time to live at one location is around 12 years. In response to the refinance later argument, remember that you might pay 5% of the remaining balance to refinance, and for a 50yr loan with 20% down, even if you refinance in 25 years **you are paying a 5% fee on over 80% of the original loan value**. Might as well grab an adjustable rate mortgage because this is gambling rates only ever go down, and you are sure how finance is going to look in the 2050s, 2060s, and 2070s. Notice that 50 year loans span more than half of human total life expectancy in any country. This is making a bet on market conditions when people are well into their retirement age. This loan term is: 64% of total life expectancy in the US 70% of remaining adult life expectancy 90% of remaining adult life expectancy just after college 112% of life expectancy for the median first time home buyer today 100% of life expectancy for the median first time buyer in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. A new college grad would be taking on a debt commitment for 90% of their remaining life. But remember that's median, \\~40% of new grads taking that deal will have been deceased by term end. A new college grad will have 50% remaining balance on this loan at retirement. A median first time buyer will have 87% remaining balance at the median retirement age. A median first time buyer in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s would have 72% remaining balance by retirement.

They introduced HOPE, a self-modifying TITAN variant with a Continuum Memory System (multi-frequency FFN chain) + deep optimizer stack. They published the research but no code (like always), so I rebuilt the architecture and infra in PyTorch over the weekend. Repo: https://github.com/kmccleary3301/nested_learning ## Highlights - Level clock + CMS implementation (update-period gating, associative-memory optimizers). - HOPE block w/ attention, TITAN memory, self-modifier pathway. - Hydra configs for pilot/mid/target scales, uv-managed env, Deepspeed/FSDP launchers. - Data pipeline: filtered RefinedWeb + supplements (C4, RedPajama, code) with tokenizer/sharding scripts. - Evaluation: zero-shot harness covering PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-E/C, BoolQ, SIQA, CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA + NIAH long-context script. ## What I need help with: 1. Running larger training configs (760M+, 4\u20138k context) and reporting W&B benchmarks. 2. Stress-testing CMS/self-modifier stability + alternative attention backbones. 3. Continual-learning evaluation (streaming domains) & regression tests. If you try it, please file issues/PRs\u2014especially around stability tricks, data pipelines, or eval scripts. Would love to see how it stacks up against these Qwen, DeepSeek, Minimax, and Kimi architectures.",

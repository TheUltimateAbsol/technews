The Asus eStore on Amazon.de here in Germany sold more Prime and Dual 5070s than Mindfactory sold on all 5070 models combined and that does not include any 5070s Amazon sold directly. It's Asus eStore only. The Steam Hardware Survey is not wrong and HUB\"s estimate of a 20% AMD market share on currently sold GPUs in this generation is just based on bad data that represents a tiny distorted portion of the market.",

I might say I called it, but I'm hardly the first: there is no need to push 15W+ unrestricted on these phones and wait for them to thermal throttle.

The downside, however, is that this can cause the phone to overheat and shut down \\[tests\\]. Furthermore, the phone throttles significantly under sustained load. \u2026 >The OnePlus 15 features the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, one of the fastest SoCs currently available. However, our observations in other smartphones have shown that it isn't always able to deliver its full potential, heating up too quickly to be adequately cooled within the compact smartphone's chassis. >The OnePlus 15 seems to have particular problems with this, with it **even lagging behind its predecessor**, the OnePlus 13\u2026 Not every test, but some show a performance regression. // Most concerning is 1T power. Notebookcheck measures power draw under a full GB5.5 run, including both 1T and nT. The average went up a lot, but not simply because of nT, but also **1T** power draw hits 10W+. To compare, I took a look at [the 8 Elite, Dimensity 9400](https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-13-Smartphone-Review-Let-the-battery-revolution-begin.932327.0.html), and the [Dimensity 9500](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Oppo-Find-X9-smartphone-review-High-end-for-under-900-but-with-SoC-problems.1173149.0.html): |Phone & SoC|Full 1T & nT Avg Power|1T Peak Power| |:-|:-|:-| |OnePlus 13, 8 Elite|6.08 W|10.70 W| |OnePlus 15, 8 Elite Gen 5|9.28 W|12.20 W| |Oppo Find X8 Pro, Dimensity 9400|5.90 W|11.10 W| |Oppo Find X9, Dimensity 9500|5.55 W|7.17 W| Again, no energy measurements, so \"race to idle\" remains unconfirmed, but OnePlus / Qualcomm decided to really let the SoC spike as much as it wants, as 1T loads and nT loads can basically hit the same peak. Oppo / MediaTek seemingly showed much more restraint under 1T load.",

Unfortunately, needlessly generic companions, a weak soundtrack, and story-tied fetch quests drag the overall experience down a bit. Still, fans of the Prime entries will definitely have more than enough fun with this title.

Despite the prolonged development period, the campaign comes together to deliver an excellent outing for Samus as she explores an expansive world with new psychic powers that imbue the core of the game in fun, innovative ways.

It feels great to explore the maze-like levels, unlock upgrades, and slowly discover new areas of the world. The art design and soundtrack are awesome. The open desert area, which I explore on a motorcycle, is a perfect contrast to traditional \"Metroid\" gameplay. It's a shame that the game doesn't make more use of Samus' telekinetic abilities, though. The new characters are disappointing. They annoy me with unnecessary explanations or corny Marvel-like banter. I would also have liked a higher level of difficulty. These criticisms are likely to bother veteran \"Metroid\" players in particular. Despite its shortcomings, \"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond\" provides one of the best reasons to buy a Switch 2. The game ticks off virtually all of the console's technical features and delivers an extremely sharp (4K) or extremely smooth (120 FPS) gaming experience. The mouse control is particularly impressive \u2013 it fundamentally changes the way I interact with the game.

The new story characters are not in any way overly chatty, and this is still the mysterious and moody alien treasure hunt Metroid fans have come to love, but now with a funky alien bike. I still rate the original Prime trilogy over this, but those games were pretty much faultless, whereas this is just thoroughly excellent.

That said, those who have been waiting for this game for nearly two decades needn\u2019t worry too much, as Metroid Prime 4 largely locks onto the core of what made this series great.

Even the most vocal diehard fans should be pleased by the fundamentals, and for those willing to accept them, the new wrinkles iron out nicely.

        "text_content": "Haven't seen this covered, just felt like bringing it up. On December 31st of 2024, Devolver Digital made a [tweet](https://xcancel.com/devolverdigital/status/1874153848300052864) talking about their upcoming plans for 2025, directly referencing a number of titles that were already announced, and hinting towards some that were still kept under wrap. Of those hinted towards: * A hilariously brutal VR game. - **GORN 2** * A precision platformer from a dev we've worked with before where guns are crucial in more ways than one. - **Shotgun Cop Man (My Friend Pedro Developer)** * A psychedelic cooperative FPS that blends high octane action with an extraction mission game loop and a touch of intentional jank. - **Mycopunk** * A ultra addicting roguelite that we can't say too much more about than that. It's got balls. - **BALL x PIT** * A new entry in an ingenious 'create your own narrative' series. - **Look Outside** And, relevant to the title: * An incredible expansion to a big, big hit. Now, it's important to note that this thread was made **close to a year ago**, and as such deadlines can easily be shifted. Cult Of The Lamb: Woolhaven was announced over the summer and was given a release window of Early 2026. It's very much possible that Devolver Digital was aiming to have it out Late 2025 at the time for which they made the original thread. But, given that everything else has been revealed, alongside with the fact that that this is the only part of the thread that hasn't been fulfilled, we may see something pop up sooner rather than later. Depending on their definition of a \"big hit\", signs point to Katana Zero, which had a reveal trailer for its expansion earlier this year (and one dev saying it's development was nearing it's end). Ultimately, it's up to speculation. Maybe something will pop up at TGA?",

Shovel Knight was released when a few indie games a year became viral smash hits and sold a million or so copies. Shovel Knight is an excellent game, but to be blunt, they kinda won the lottery. It was the defining Indie hit of the Wii U and 3DS, the generation where Nintendo leaned its hardest on Indie partners, and likely around the absolute height of NES nostalgia. Nintendo gave it 5 official Amiibo and a few Smash cameos, even. Mina is based on classic handheld/adventure games, both inspirations being the B-tier alternatives to Shovel Knight's NES-style platforming in terms of mainstream popularity. To bet the farm on this project and not a safer one like a traditional Shovel Knight sequel seems very risky to me, and I haven't really heard much buzz online. I'm really hoping they pull through.",

        "text_content": "The Sims \"Project Rene\" was going to be a sort of multi-game experience based on a multiplayer style game, a classic singleplayer sims, and other gamemodes that would coexist with the classic Sims 4 game. That plan is dead. Instead, TS:PR has been cut into pieces, and the singleplayer mode is going to be sold as a straight up TS4 successor which is named Project X internally. Its main features are Open Neighborhoods (not a complete open city like TS3, but only a sector of it) with busier streets, detailed graphics akin to the early showcases, and SOME TS4 aspects being carried over to TS:PX. Because the Rene base wasn't built to be a singleplayer experience at its core, it's much simpler than TS4 currently (sounds [familiar](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sims_Olympus)?), but it wasn't made as \"The Sims 5\" even if it's branded as such in the end. So, why kill TS4 if EA meant to keep it alive forever? Simply, the engine is too old, too messy, and they don't want to support it anymore because the upkeep costs are too big for what they can do with it. And as many people suspected, the Q/A and development of new TS4 content is becoming much harder with the engine being a mishmash of code from the early 2010s. Also, they want to identify mod-related issues easier because people tend to report them as \"game issues\". EA also intends to add a \"fan-favorite feature\" to the base game, with some Sims 4 planned content moving over to the new game. It's said to be coming out at the end of next year. source: [https://simscommunity.info/2025/12/02/the-sims-4-remaster-project-x/](https://simscommunity.info/2025/12/02/the-sims-4-remaster-project-x/)",

A slew of new supply is still making its way through the multifamily housing market. That, coupled with weakening demand, especially from the youngest workers, is pushing vacancies up and rents down. The national median rent for apartments fell 1% in November from October, and now stands at $1,367, according to Apartment List. It was the fourth consecutive month-over-month decline. Apartment rents are down 1.1% from November 2024 and have fallen 5.2% from their 2022 peak. \u201cEarlier this year, it appeared that annual growth was on track to flip positive for the first time since mid-2023; however, that rebound stalled out and reversed course during a particularly slow summer,\u201d according to Apartment List researchers. After hitting a record high for this index, which dates back to 2017, in October, the national multifamily vacancy rate remained at 7.2% in November. The historic surge in multifamily construction over the past few years is now pulling back, but a good supply of new units is still coming online at a time of much weaker demand. The fall historically sees the biggest slowdown in multifamily rents, but this year it\u2019s even more pronounced. CoStar reported the biggest monthly drops in median rent it had seen in 15 years of tracking. The primary reason is that more young people are struggling to form new households. \u201cThat 18- to 34-year-old group \u2026 I think it\u2019s up to 32.5% of those now are living with family, and that\u2019s the highest it\u2019s been in a while,\u201d said Grant Montgomery, CoStar\u2019s national director of multifamily analytics. \u201cI think it reflects high rental costs that have risen over the years, as well as the tougher job market for young folks just coming out of college.\u201d \u201cThat is where a lot of demand traditionally comes from, the core renter demand is from that sort of younger base,\u201d he said. The weakness is showing up in stocks of the major public apartment REITs. Names like AvalonBay , Equity Residential and Camden Property Trust are all down year to date. Some markets are seeing rents drop faster than others, due to local economic factors. Las Vegas, for example, is experiencing slower tourism, which in turn hits jobs there. Boston has seen a decline in federal funding for biotech as well as a drop in foreign students for its colleges and universities; both are impacting its rental sector hard. Austin, Texas, is seeing the biggest hit to rents, thanks to still more construction of multifamily units. While rents are softening nationally, and landlords are boosting concessions, renters are increasingly searching in more affordable markets. Cincinnati was the market most searched for, followed by Atlanta and Kansas City, Missouri, according to a Yardi report that looked at where apartment hunters were active last summer, the traditionally busiest time for new leasing. St. Louis saw the biggest quarterly jump in tenant interest, and Washington, D.C., dropped from the top spot to No. 4. \u201cThe Midwest, in particular, drew more attention than ever, signaling that many of its \u2018hidden gem\u2019 markets are no longer a secret,\u201d according to the report, which found 11 of the top 30 cities for renter demand were in the Midwest. Yardi also revised its expectations for 2026 supply, saying that while new supply will decline through 2027, a larger-than-expected under-construction pipeline caused it to increase its previous quarterly estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 6.8% and 2.5%, respectively. As construction continues to slow into next year, the overall market should stabilize somewhat, according to the Apartment List report. \u201cThat said, the supply boom still has a bit of runway remaining, and the demand outlook has begun to appear weaker amid a shaky labor market,\u201d researchers wrote.",

Even if he could rent a comparable unit for $1300/mo less (very likely), it should be obvious that he'd have to rent for years to break even against eating a $90k loss. And rent will go up over those years, whereas the bulk of his mortgage payment (P&I) will remain fixed. IOW, that spread will narrow over time. There are also beaucoup tax writeoffs for owning, and I don't see those factored in here. Renting would have been a better decision than buying, but this is where the illiquidity of RE gets you. The transaction fees are so damned high that sometimes it just makes sense not to make a transaction. If it was a stock, I'd say \"sunk cost fallacy, dump it, reopen a new position\". But not when it costs $45k for a fucking bartender to list your place on the MLS. That fee could fund a year of shelter payments on its own.",

        "score": 64,
        "text_content": "Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, has argued that the recent surge in spending by Big Tech on AI-data centers is economically unrealistic. On the \u201cDecoder\u201d podcast he estimated that building and fully outfitting a one-gigawatt AI data center costs about $80 billion. Given that industry announcements suggest firms are planning up to 100 gigawatts of compute capacity, the total capital expenditure could reach around $8 trillion, which would require roughly $800 billion in profits just to cover interest. Krishna also highlighted that AI hardware like GPUs depreciates quickly and often needs to be replaced roughly every five years, which further undermines long-term financial returns. He said he believes the likelihood of achieving true artificial general intelligence (AGI) with current technology is between zero and one percent, making the massive infrastructure bets more speculative than certain. Still, Krishna acknowledged the potential of today\u2019s AI tools to deliver significant enterprise productivity gains. He cautioned that while infrastructure-heavy \u201cAGI-race\u201d spending may not pay off, more modest, business-focused AI deployments could still be worthwhile.

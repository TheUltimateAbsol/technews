It took AMD almost a decade to slip from 35% to 8% even though the were hardly competitive for most of that time outside of maybe some well priced Phenom II parts in the early 2010's. And then it took them almost 8 years of consistently quality chips to get from that low point back to 40%",

The fairy's English voice did not annoy me and I thought that the gameplay elements, the powers, the items and improvement systems, were all simple yet fun and well made. I got lost for a bit in one of the first dungeons because of how the map worked and how you had to figure out how to get to different parts of the sub levels.

Metroid Prime 4 (the Retro version, NOT the original) was originally intended to be a cross-gen launch window title for Switch 2, akin to that of BOTW (he specifically states launch window, NOT launch day title) 2. Believes Donkey Kong Bananza might have, *\u201dswitched places,\u201d* in terms of development to compensate with MP4 being pushed back, further claiming MP4 was intended for Q4 3. Claims MP4 hit yet another snag in development, but doesn\u2019t go into detail beyond it not involving anything too major, and that it didn\u2019t have anything to do with crunch, layoffs, or bad management. 4. Claims the marketing has been off because of these snags in development 5. Claims MP4 was announced as early as it was due to the reception Federation Force garnered, with Nintendo wanting fans to know they still cared about the franchise (this is even odder because in the same tweet he literally says \u201cThey (Nintendo) don\u2019t react to fan outcry, they just block out the noise,\u201d so idk why Federation Force, of all games, would be been the exception) 6. He reiterates again MP4 still isn\u2019t done, and claims a Germany ratings board somehow means the game is 100% done, unlike South Korea (his words not mine) 7. Compares the development of MP4 to Rockstar\u2019s treatment of GTA VI 8. Still has no clue whether or not the game will be delayed to 2026, but he believes it may come out November 2025 **EDIT:** I\u2019m not denying KiwiTalkz knows his shit, as he has direct ties to Retro, but I can\u2019t help but feel a lot of this feels wishy-washy. The concept that Nintendo have only ever announced MP4 insanely early is hilarious considering while MP4 currently holds that crown, they were very bad about prematurely announcing a lot of Switch games years before their release. Zelda U (which would become BOTW), Bayo 3, and SMTV all took SEVERAL years literal years in between announcement and release, so MP4 isn\u2019t alone in that category. I also don\u2019t get his comment about Federation Force making Nintendo want to prematurely announce MP4. Next you\u2019re going to tell me they\u2019ve been cooking up a new Chibi Robo for the past decade after everyone hated Zip Lash",

Also, *highly* doubt the idea of Prime 4 getting announced early due to Federation Force, which was almost a full 2-years prior, given that same E3 featured the Samus Returns 3DS announcement. I think Prime 4 was announced as early as it was because it genuinely *was* in active development within Bandai Namco - Nintendo probably just didn't anticipate development needing to be scrapped yet.",

Many people were telling you the economy is in a bad spot and the job numbers were trash. This is just proof that the market is shaky, not that real estate will continue to appreciate imo. The data is bad and probably going to get worse as the courts allow federal job and funding cuts to take effect and the tariff pain actually starts to work its way through the system.

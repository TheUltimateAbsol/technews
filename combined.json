At least 170 of the nearly 54,000 contributions to the leading Democratic candidate\u2019s campaign came from donors with addresses outside the United States, an examination of NYC Campaign Finance Board records found. Only US citizens or permanent legal residents are allowed to contribute to political campaigns and political action committees under federal, state and city law, and candidates are expected to return any of the illegal donations. Violators who knowingly accept foreign donations could face hefty fines and imprisonment. But so far, the campaign has failed to return 88 of the foreign donations worth a total of $7,190, records showed. Mamdani\u2019s campaign has brought in $4 million in private donations, scored another $12.7 million in public matching funds, and with less than a month to go before election day, has nearly $6.1 million in hand. His campaign issued a statement Saturday saying \u201cwe will of course return any donations that are not in compliance with CFB law\u201d after being provided a detailed breakdown of the 88 donations yet to be returned. A campaign spokesperson, however, declined to clarify why so many foreign donations are still in Mamdani\u2019s war chest. **Curtis Sliwa's Response** \u201cWhere there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire, so I would be very concerned,\u201d said Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa, upon learning of the foreign money coming into Mamdani\u2019s campaign. \u201cThere is probably a lot more in terms of foreign money.\u201d Two months ago, Sliwa, during an interview with Fox Business, called on the US Department of Justice to investigate his suspicions that Mamdani is being aided by difficult-to-trace \u201cdark money\u201d illegally being funneled into super PACs through foreign nationals. \u201cIt\u2019s very problematic, not just for Zohran Mamdani, but anybody who has these kinds of PACs, because it\u2019s a license to illegally funnel money,\u201d Sliwa told The Post. \u201cAnd foreign countries know you don\u2019t have to go to war against America. All you gotta do is manipulate the election.\u201d Most of the foreign donations started coming in June in the lead-up to the Democratic primary, in which Mamdani scored an upset victory over New York City Mayor Eric Adams and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Tech professionals, doctors, university professors, students and retired teachers made up the bulk of the foreign contributions, with some pledging as little as $1 to the campaign of the Democratic socialist, and as much as $2,100, records showed. **Some of the foreign donors revealed** - Among the biggest donors was James Furlaud, an environmental scientist at Australia\u2019s University of Tasmania, who pledged $2,100 to the campaign. Furlaud studies the effects of climate change on forests and how it could lead to fires, according to his published academic work. He did not return a request for comment. - Ada Diaz Ahmed, who is described as a Dubai-based investor, donated $2,100 to the campaign in September, records show. - Jun-Dai Bates Kobashigawa, a software developer who lives in Montreal, Canada, donated $250 to the campaign in July. Kobashigawa, who works for GoDaddy, grew up in San Francisco, and attended Bard College in Dutchess County. He did not return a request for comment. - Ugur Macit, who lives in the town of Muhlheim am Main in Germany, also donated $250 to the Mamdani campaign in August. Macit is a software engineer who studied computer science at the University of Dusseldorf, according to public records. He could not be reached for comment. - Ahmed Enbya, a physician in Calgary, Canada, donated $100 to the campaign in September, filings show. He could not be reached for comment. Most of the contributions to the socialist\u2019s campaign have come from outside New York City, city filings revealed last month. The frontrunner took in a total of $1.05 million over the last several weeks \u2014 more than double the $507,000 raised by Cuomo. The city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board declined comment, saying it is in the process of auditing all campaigns this election cycle citywide.",

It is commonly quoted that NC has energy or performance advantage on some task based on some small scale calculation, but they generally lacks of rigorous theoretical framework to prove which types of works they are good at. There're good progress in scaling up number of neurons in NC, but the software ecosystem is still very immature, there's missing gap between low level and high level language so it is difficult to bring researchers worldwide to work on the ecosystem. But certainly not a dead end since not much resources (e.g. compare to quantum computing) have been given to it anyway, and it seems like an exciting and rapidly expanding field from academic perspective. And I am pretty sure the large scale calculation of NC were all done in digital chips.",

In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size, supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus, we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average 2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at [this https URL](https://github.com/thu-nics/C2C).\"",

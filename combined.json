        "text_content": "Note: I also posted this to r/NintendoSwitch, but I originally planned on posting it here, and I was given the blessing to still post it here verbatim by one of the mods. https://preview.redd.it/ld4pl72oycef1.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&s=0267701bc9b84ed2644c3fc16dd489ec125b403b A relatively common assumption I've seen these last few months is that Nintendo already has their entire 2025 lineup announced, with the reasoning usually amounting to \"they have a game lined up for every month\" or \"the Switch also had a monthly release cadence in 2017.\" It's certainly not impossible, but I think there are plenty of holes in that argument, as well as reasons to believe at least one more first-party title will be announced for release this year, and I wanted to break down both. And that's on top of Splatoon Raiders. However, that's partly because contrary to the initial reporting, the game doesn't appear to have actually been rated yet (the announcement video showed a combined E10+-Rating Pending label, and Splatoon 3 is E10+). The trailer was also a relatively straightforward teaser that didn't tell us much about the game at all. My money is on it being a 2026 release, still within the Switch 2's first overall year, but that could also be the case for all of the potential releases I mention later; I just think it's likely there's at least one more game that gets announced for 2025. First, why I think the argument is flawed: \\- Nintendo skipped the months of February, April, and May this year. Suppose we're holding Nintendo to a game-a-month average, which was fairly typical in the later years of the Switch. In that case, they're technically behind on at least one month, depending on if Welcome Tour and Drag x Drive meaningfully count as much smaller-scale releases than has been the norm for Nintendo lately, and if Splatoon Raiders is a 2025 release. Switch 2 Editions are essentially next-gen exclusive DLC, so they're in the same category as the physical bundles that Gen 8 and 9 of Pokemon and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe received, and they take up less resources, so I wouldn't count them toward the quota. \\- The later months of the year are when Nintendo tends to double-up on releases per month. October in particular had 2 releases every year during the Switch generation except for 2018 (when excluding The World Ends With You: Final Remix) and 2024. \\- During the Switch's first year, development resources were being split across it and the 3DS, and many of Nintendo's regular partners like Intelligent Systems, Grezzo, and Game Freak released their 2017 games solely on 3DS. Everything is now centered around the Switch family of systems, so at minimum, anything in development is going to be playable on Switch 2, even if they don't make it a formal cross-gen release for whatever reason. While there's bound to be some evening out because Switch/Switch 2 games take longer to make, the Switch's first year was held back by Nintendo's continued 3DS support, particularly in that it didn't receive a November game aside from Snipperclips getting DLC and a retail release while that system got Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon, despite that slot usually being treated as a core part of the holiday lineup across the systems Nintendo supports. \\- As things stand now, Nintendo's holiday lineup consists solely of cross-generation releases and less proven spinoffs, which isn't ideal when trying to sell a brand-new system during its first holiday season. While the last Hyrule Warriors took the main holiday 2020 release slot, COVID messed everything up that year, and I imagine Nintendo originally wanted Bowser's Fury to fulfill that role before settling on Age of Calamity because of its ties to Breath of the Wild. And while Sakurai's involvement with Kirby Air Riders is bound to raise its profile, that's mostly going to resonate with the core Nintendo audience and overlaps with Mario Kart World among the casual crowd. And that's if it even releases this year - [as relayed by Bill Trinen, Sakurai's apparently said we won't have any news on it for \"quite a while,\" ](https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen)and considering that Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Kid Icarus Uprising were both delayed out of their original release years, it wouldn't be a shock for Air Riders to receive this treatment. I think the single most telling sign that we have more in store for this year, though, is the distinct lack of anything announced for the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. Considering how they tied 4 releases to the 35th anniversary (with Super Mario Bros. 35 and Super Mario 3D All-Stars being explicit tie-ins), it would come as quite the surprise if the 40th anniversary came and went without any games being tied to it. I feel like there has to be something, even if it's as simple as Super Mario Bros. 40 or a Switch 2 Edition of Super Mario Bros. Wonder while the \"big\" release slips into 2026, much like how Bowser's Fury slipped into 2021. I hesitate to say Super Mario Maker 3 because EPD 10 launched 2 games in 2023 (Pikmin 4 and Wonder), though. There are also another 2 games that aren't formally on the release schedule, but our knowledge of them comes directly from the horse's mouth instead of dubious rumors: \\- In the Switch 2 Direct, an icon for Yoshi's Woolly World was shown slightly off-screen when backwards-compatible Switch games were being discussed. While evidently an error and likely confused for Crafted World, in the icon, one of the Poochy Pups from the 3DS cover art can be seen in a slightly different position from where it appears on there. [Here, the Poochy Pup is level with the leaves on the tree in the background.](https://preview.redd.it/40s6f5vvxcef1.png?width=1863&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a3006e8810f4aae95d8f2020cf889759f632606) [In the Switch icon, shown directly right of the \\\\\"Game Type\\\\\" arrow, this Poochy Pup can be seen moved down to be in line with the tree's branch. Other artwork for Poochy and Yoshi's Woolly World doesn't depict it there at all, from what I can tell, so this icon is unique to this image and suggests a port is indeed on the way.](https://preview.redd.it/8vcgd0s8ycef1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=06f4d04d9a4827d0707610b4c0376aac0c6b8fb9) I do think there's a good chance this port simply releases as a Switch 1 game that comes with the equivalent of a Switch 2 patch built in, given it's not a new release and isn't likely to implement much of the Switch 2's unique features, but it would nevertheless help fill out the release schedule and give Switch 1 owners a nice reprieve from their currently 4-month drought of first-party releases (if it comes soon). \\- The Nintendo Switch Online Playtest Program is perhaps the least likely candidate of anything I mention here, as it was only just announced that a second playtest is imminent, and I doubt its only purpose would be making sure the servers for the game can handle more players before a 2025 launch. 2026 seems more likely now. I was one of the original 10,000 playtesters, though, and having actually played it, it is very much intended as its own project and not the \"feature\" Nintendo's vaguely been calling it. I don't want to say much more because they're being stingy on people talking about it publicly, aside from the public knowledge that [both of the directors of the original Splatoon are working on it](https://www.freepatentsonline.com/20250083046.pdf), but it is their most ambitious online game/new IP since Splatoon and is very content-rich even in its pre-release state. I mean, the initial playtest datamine uncovered a 70+ song soundtrack. What I'm getting at is that it's not something they've thrown together to test something for another game, which I'm still seeing people assume (I already saw \"the next Animal Crossing will be an MMO\" come up in response to the playtest's return). Lastly, there are 5 developers I want to mention that are likely to have their next games release soon...potentially as soon as this year. \\- While EPD is largely covered, with each core team either having a game already announced/out for Switch 2 (EPD 4 appears to be behind Welcome Tour and the Playtest game, with Drag x Drive likely also being theirs; EPD 5 is presumably on Splatoon Raiders; EPD 8 did Bananza; EPD 9 made Mario Kart World) or having released games too recently to expect much for now (EPD 3 with Tears of the Kingdom and supervising Echoes of Wisdom, EPD 10 with Pikmin 4 and Mario Wonder), EPD 5 likely is deep in development on Animal Crossing. Contrary to popular belief, the Animal Crossing and Splatoon teams are not actually shared outright. It's [mostly the leadership at EPD 5 that is shared between the two, alongside some of the art and music teams](https://youtu.be/pFsyJmGj4K8?t=300), with the core programming staff being separate. So the next Animal Crossing is likely quite far along now, and it would be quite the holiday heavy-hitter this year if it happens. \\- Next Level Games has had a steady 3-year release cadence since Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon in 2013, so as long as that holds true, they'll have a game ready to go this year. That's not to say their games have had 3-year cycles, though, as Luigi's Mansion 3 began life on the Wii U (so likely in 2014-2015). Battle League was a smaller project, and 3 did so well that Luigi's Mansion is arguably third in the pantheon of Mario spinoffs after the Party and Kart games now, so it would be an ideal second release in October if it's ready. \\- Intelligent Systems averages one game release per year. The only year they've skipped since 1997 is 2022, and even then, they released 2 games in 2023 to make up for that (and Fire Emblem Engage was seemingly done for as long as a year before it came out). If nothing else, if they miss this year, they'll probably have 2 games next year; Rhythm Heaven Groove is likely their project, since they shared a team with the WarioWare series and that was moved over to Intelligent Systems in full beginning with Gold, but that team also shares responsibility for Paper Mario (with TTYD being a remake with a lot of outsourcing, with Tose working on it extensively), meaning the Fire Emblem team is due for a game. \\- Camelot Software Planning has been quiet since Mario Golf: Super Rush launched 4 years ago, which is the longest they've ever gone without releasing anything. They're a small developer (only 40 employees right now), but we can expect to hear from them soon. I do wonder if they're doing something other than a Mario sports game, especially with many dormant Nintendo IPs getting revived as of late (e.g. Another Code, Famicom Detective Club, Tomodachi Life, Rhythm Heaven, and Endless Ocean), but I wouldn't count on Golden Sun 4. \\- Lastly, Bandai Namco's Pokemon team, which is separate from the Studio 2/Studio S group they have for Sakurai's games and development support on EPD projects (Pokken and New Snap shared leadership, I believe, with largely different staff otherwise) has been quiet since 2021. It's not likely that whatever they were working on was their Nintendo project that was ambiguously either cancelled or put on hold last year, either, as it was said to have been commissioned by Nintendo and not The Pokemon Company, who has coordinated their collaborations before. New Pokemon Snap was the most successful non-mobile spinoff for the series in quite some time, so a sequel would make sense, though another possibility might be a rhythm game drawing from Bandai Namco's work on the Taiko no Tatsujin series (and in the future, I can see them taking on the task of a successor to the Game Boy Color Trading Card Game RPGs, since Pocket's success likely has TPC wanting to cash in as they did with the Let's Go games). Again, I want to stress that I at most expect to see 1-2 more announcements for 2025, with every other potential release being slated for 2026 or later instead should they come to fruition. I just wanted to get some thoughts I've been sitting on out there (before the Pokemon Presents tomorrow) and mention everything that still has a shot at coming this year while sticking to more viable possibilities and ignoring the rumor mill. If anyone cared enough to skim through this, I appreciate it.",

I work for one of the largest RE photography companies in the state with many different brokers and agents. Most of my business is dealing with agents listing existing home resale on the MLS. This has been the slowest July I have ever seen in over a decade, especially over the last 2-3 weeks its like someone flipped a light switch and everything just fell off a cliff. This should be prime listing season where I am so swamped I barely have time to unwind before having to go out the next day and do it all over again for months on end. Right now its about as busy as it is during winter. And I am hearing similar things from other photographers and agents I shoot for. My wife works for a brokerage office as part of a team and is saying similar thing for her team as well as the greater office overall. Although inventory is increasing (from slower sales pace attrition and longer days on market), new listings are still under where they were in 2022 so far according to redfin data and thats how I make a living. In addition looks like new listings peaked early around April this year, usually listings peak in June or July. Lots of sellers delisting as well because they are not selling for the price they could a year or two ago. I have really not experienced anything like this before in all my time doing this it really feels like the market is about to break apart. I feel like we are really going to see some significant price declines heading into the fall and winter off season. And once that happens and sellers finally get the memo hopefully listings explode back to pre 2020 levels again and build from there.",

My early view was \u201cmostly flat prices nationally in 2025\u201d with some areas seeing price declines. I didn\u2019t expect either a crash in prices or a surge in prices. With inventory increasing, year-over-year (YoY) price growth has slowed nationally, and declining in many areas. The following table shows the YoY price slowdown. Note that the median price is impacted by the mix of homes sold. The seasonally adjusted Case-Shiller National Index is essentially unchanged year-to-date (YTD). The index was at 327.81 in December 2024 and was at 327.90 in the April report. And the Freddie Mac HPI SA is down slightly YTD. The index was at 299.29 in December, and is now at 297.69, a decline of 0.5%. Other measures are also indicating a slowdown in the YoY growth, but not a collapse in prices. ICE reported this morning: Annual Home Price Growth Slowed to 1.3% in June * Annual home price growth slowed to 1.3% in June, from 1.6% in May, the slowest rate in two years * 27 of the 100 largest U.S. markets saw annual price declines in June, a softness not seen since the immediate aftermath of the Fed\u2019s initial rate increases in 2022 * Home prices rose by a modest 0.03% in the month on a seasonally adjusted basis, the equivalent of a seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of +0.36%, suggesting a propensity for further slowing **Based on the trend, the increase in inventory (and months-of-supply), it appears house prices will be unchanged or down slightly in 2025.** And that means real house prices (inflation adjusted) will be down this year. As of April, real house prices (based on the Case-Shiller National Index) are down 1.7% from the peak in 2022. Here is an updated graph I posted three years: House Price Declines: How Long for Real Prices to Recover? The real return following the \u201879 peak was 6.5 years. It took 11 years for real prices to reach the previous peak following the peak in \u201889. And it took 14.5 years to return to the real peak reached during the housing bubble. It has now been 35 months since the real peak in house prices. The key is it typically takes a long time for prices to return to the previous real price peak.",

                "raw_content": "* Sluggish homebuying demand and a pileup of inventory are deterring prospective home sellers, some of whom are opting to rent their homes out instead of sell. * Existing-home sales hit a nine-month low as record-high home prices dissuaded buyers. * Home sales, prices and listings are holding up relatively well in the Rust Belt, which has attracted buyers because it\u2019s affordable. New listings of U.S. homes for sale fell 3.2% in June to the lowest seasonally-adjusted level since October 2023. That\u2019s the biggest month-over-month decline since February 2023. New listings fell 3.4% year over year, the first annual decline since October 2023. Active listings\u2014the total number of homes for sale\u2014fell 0.3% month over month in June. That\u2019s the first decline since July 2023 on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Still, active listings were up 13.3% from a year earlier, sitting near the highest level in five years. \u201cThe balance of power in the housing market has shifted toward buyers because listings have piled up and demand has slowed down,\u201d said Redfin Senior Economist Asad Khan. \u201cProspective sellers are feeling discouraged by this new reality. Some are reacting by staying put or renting their homes out instead of selling\u2014especially if they\u2019re at risk of taking a haircut.\u201d The slowdown in listings marks a reversal from the start of the year, when the story of the U.S. housing market was rising supply; listings piled up because the mortgage rate lock-in effect eased and demand simultaneously slowed due to high housing costs and economic uncertainty. Sellers were forced to lower their prices after watching their homes linger on the market for weeks, and in some cases, months. Now, some are opting to forgo selling. \u201cFor many folks who bought at the peak of the pandemic market, selling might not be the best option right now,\u201d said Connie Durnal, a Redfin Premier real estate agent in the Dallas area. \u201cI have several clients who purchased their homes in early 2022 and need to move, but the math is just really, really tight. I\u2019m advising them to lease their homes out if they can\u2019t afford to take a loss. I think I will have a lot of clients coming back to list this time next year.\u201d Home Sales Dipped in June as Prices Hit a Record High Pending home sales fell 2.2% month over month in June to the lowest level since November 2023 on a seasonally-adjusted basis, and dropped 2.4% year over year. Existing-home sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4,159,943\u2014little changed from both a month and a year earlier, but the lowest level in nine months. Roughly 57,000 home-purchase agreements were canceled in June as high housing costs gave buyers cold feet. That\u2019s equal to 14.9% of homes that went under contract last month\u2014the highest June rate in records dating back to 2017.* The median home sale price hit a record high of $447,035 in June, and mortgage rates hovered near 7%\u2014more than twice the record low hit during the pandemic. One piece of good news for buyers is that prices aren\u2019t rising as quickly as they were in the past; the median sale price climbed 1% year over year in June\u2014roughly on par with the prior month\u2019s 0.7% growth, which was the slowest in roughly two years. Homes are also less likely to sell for above their asking price than in the past, a sign that buyers have bargaining power. Less than one-third (30.9%) of homes that sold in June went for over their list price, the lowest June share in five years. Redfin predicts home prices will begin falling on a year-over-year basis by the end of 2025. When demand is slow, it\u2019s critical for sellers to make sure their homes are priced fairly and in good condition, Redfin agents say. They also advise buyers not to rule out homes that are priced beyond their budget, as sellers may be willing to come down on price or offer concessions. *Please note that homes that fell out of contract during a given month didn\u2019t necessarily go under contract the same month. For example, a home that fell out of contract in June could have gone under contract in May. The Typical Home Takes Over a Month to Sell The typical home that went under contract in June sat on the market for 39 days, up from 33 days a year earlier and the longest span for any June since 2020. Roughly two in five (38.3%) homes that went under contract did so within two weeks, down from 43.1% a year earlier and the lowest June share since 2017. June 2025 Metro-Level Highlights: Sales, Prices and Listings Are Rising Quickly in the Rust Belt The figures below are based on a list of the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. Some metros may be removed from time to time to ensure data accuracy. Refer to our metrics definition page for explanations of metrics used in this report. Metro-level data are not seasonally adjusted. All changes below represent year-over-year changes. Sales * Pending sales rose most in Virginia Beach, VA (14.4%), Dallas (8.2%) and Warren, MI (8.1%). Six of the 10 metros where pending sales rose fastest are in the Rust Belt, which has attracted homebuyers because it\u2019s relatively affordable. * Pending sales fell most in Florida: Fort Lauderdale, FL (-11.7%), Las Vegas (-11.3%) and Miami (-11%) saw the biggest declines. Florida is home to four of the 10 metros where pending sales fell fastest. * Closed home sales rose most in the Midwest, with the largest increases in Cincinnati (11.4%), Milwaukee (11.1%) and Virginia Beach (10.7%). Four of the 10 metros where closed sales rose fastest are in the Midwest. * Closed home sales fell most in Florida: Fort Lauderdale (-23%), Miami (-16.1%) and West Palm Beach, FL (-12.2%) saw the biggest declines. Prices * Prices rose most in Newark, NJ (8.9%), Detroit (8.6%) and Cleveland (8.1%). Six of the 10 metros where prices rose fastest are in the Rust Belt. * Prices fell most in Oakland, CA (-4.6%), West Palm Beach (-4.1%) and Jacksonville (-3.9%). Of the 12 metros where prices fell, four are in Florida and three are in Texas. Housing markets across Florida and Texas have cooled rapidly amid a surge in homebuilding, rising insurance costs and extreme weather events. Supply * New listings rose most in Warren (13%), Boston (9.8%) and Cincinnati (8.9%). Five of the 10 metros where new listings rose fastest are in the Rust Belt. * New listings fell most in San Francisco (-17.2%), Tampa, FL (-14.1%) and Nassau County, NY (-13.6%). California is home to five of the 10 metros where new listings fell fastest. * Active listings rose most in Las Vegas (34.5%), Dallas (29%) and Anaheim, CA (29.6%). Seven of the 10 metros where active listings rose fastest are in the West. * Active listings fell in three metros: Nassau County (-7.2%), San Francisco (-5.7%) and Kansas City, MO (-0.1%). Speed/Competition * Florida saw the biggest uptick in days on market: In Miami, the typical home that went under contract did so in 88 days, up 23 days from a year earlier\u2014the biggest increase among the metros Redfin analyzed. Next came Fort Lauderdale (+17 days) and Orlando, FL (+16 days). * Days on market dropped in three metros: Kansas City, MO (-8 days), Chicago (-1 day) and New York (-1 day). * Homes were most likely to sell above their list price in Newark (69.6% of homes sold above list), Nassau County (58.2%) and San Francisco (58.1%). * Homes were least likely to sell above their list price in Florida: West Palm Beach (5.7%), Fort Lauderdale (7.6%) and Miami (7.6%) had the lowest share of homes selling above list.",

                "raw_content": "The S&P 500 moved higher on Monday as optimism around earnings overshadowed any investor fears over the latest developments in trade. The broad market index rose 0.14% and closed at 6,305.60 \u2014 marking the first time it ended a session above the 6,300 threshold. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.38% for a closing record of 20,974.17. Both indexes hit new all-time intraday highs earlier in the session, bolstered by advances in major technology names like Meta Platforms and Amazon . The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 19.12 points, or 0.04%, and settled at 44,323.07. This comes as earnings season is off to a strong start. Verizon shares popped 4% following a second-quarter earnings beat, spurring excitement that other reports will come in strong. It joins 62 S&P 500 companies that have reported thus far. Of those, more than 85% have topped expectations, according to FactSet data. Earnings for the second quarter are also tracking 5% year-over-year growth following the first week of results, per Bank of America. Alphabet was a standout in the session, increasing more than 2% ahead of its quarterly results Wednesday after the bell. That name as well as Tesla \u2014 the first of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies set to report \u2014 could boost the major averages if they manage to beat estimates. Shares of the electric vehicle maker ended the session marginally lower. The megacaps are expected to be a major driver of earnings growth during the second-quarter earnings season, and FactSet\u2019s John Butters expects the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d to post earnings growth of 14% in the second quarter compared to the other 493 S&P 500 companies that are seen posting growth of just 3.4%. Confidence toward this earnings season was in focus among investors, even as the White House reiterated its position on tariffs over the weekend. On Sunday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called Aug. 1 the \u201chard deadline\u201d for countries to start paying tariffs, though he also added that \u201cnothing stops countries from talking to us after Aug. 1.\u201d \u201cRarely do you injure yourself falling out of a basement window. With expectations so low in earnings, I think that the end result will end up being better than anticipated,\u201d Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, told CNBC. \u201cThat is encouraging for the market as well.\u201d More broadly, Stovall pointed out that the market is doing \u201cwhat it normally does,\u201d revealing that it tends to advance on average about another 10% after recovering all of its losses from a decline of up to 20%. With that, he thinks the S&P 500 could reach 6,600 before slipping into a new decline, which implies upside of about 4.7% from Monday\u2019s closing level. \u201cA lot of the negativity has typically been shaken out of the market during these corrections, and now we\u2019re seeing articles about maybe the economy is not as bad as we thought it was, consumer confidence is on the mend and we\u2019re not seeing the inflation numbers be adversely affected by tariffs,\u201d Stovall continued. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just a matter of time before those things kick in, but at least for now, I think investors are saying, \u2018You know what, the market is indicating that it wants to go higher.\u2019",

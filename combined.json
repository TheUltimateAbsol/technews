Thank you to all the amazing friends and colleagues from NUVIA who made the journey possible. Stay humble. Stay strong. And always always be hungry.

His career is characterized by his significant contributions to ARM-based processor designs that power modern smartphones and data centers. Professional Career History \\* Intel & Texas Instruments (Early Career): After completing his education, Williams began his career at Intel. He later moved to Texas Instruments, where he developed the TMS470, a 32-bit microcontroller based on the ARM architecture. \\* ARM (1998\u20132010): He spent 12 years at ARM, ultimately becoming a key figure in the development of several processor architectures. He is credited with leading the design of the Cortex-A8 and Cortex-A15, which were pivotal in shifting mobile computing toward high-efficiency, high-performance processors. \\* Apple (2010\u20132019): Williams served as Senior Director in Platform Architecture at Apple. He was the lead architect for every custom CPU core from the A7 (the first 64-bit mobile processor) to the A12X. During his tenure, his role expanded to overseeing the layout of the entire System-on-a-Chip (SoC) for Apple\u2019s mobile devices. He is an inventor on over 60 Apple patents related to power management and multicore technology. \\* NUVIA Inc. (2019\u20132021): In 2019, he co-founded NUVIA and served as its CEO and President. The startup focused on creating high-performance ARM-based processors for data centers, aiming to challenge the dominance of Intel and AMD in that sector. \\* Qualcomm (2021\u20132026): Following Qualcomm's acquisition of NUVIA for approximately $1.4 billion in 2021, Williams joined Qualcomm as Senior Vice President of Engineering. He has been a central figure in the development of the Oryon CPU technology used in Qualcomm\u2019s latest flagship chips.\"",

It doesn\u2019t help either that IW just stopped working on a DMZ2 for MWIII that would\u2019ve taken it out of beta and launched with a lot of new features forcing Treyarch to come in and do MWZ on Urzikstan instead. Also, Treyarch did had plans for BO6 Zombies to have an Outbreak 2.0, before going back to Round Based. It did not make a bunch of Round Based maps be next to each other because they wanted to. It was because they were in early dev on Liberty Falls Outbreak and then had to pivot cause you can't do something like that back to back. It also is why MWZ used a ton of DMZ assets.",

This shift comes **amid** ongoing investment talks between the two companies, with Nvidia previously planning a $100 billion investment in OpenAI. OpenAI has **engaged** with AMD, Cerebras and Groq for potential chip solutions, as it seeks hardware that can better meet its inference needs. Nvidia maintains its dominance in AI training chips but faces competition as OpenAI prioritizes speed and efficiency in its products, particularly for coding applications. **Source:** Reuters(Exclusive)",

        "text_content": "MIT researchers found a way to turn waste heat into computation instead of letting it dissipate. The system does not rely on electrical signals. Instead, temperature differences act as data, with heat flowing from hot to cold regions naturally performing calculations. The chip is built from specially engineered porous silicon. Its internal geometry is algorithmically **designed** so heat follows precise paths, enabling matrix vector multiplication, a core operation in AI and machine learning with over 99% accuracy in simulations. Each structure is microscopic, about the size of a grain of dust and **tailored** for a specific calculation. Multiple units can be combined to scale performance. This approach could significantly **reduce** energy loss and cooling overhead in future chips. While not a replacement for CPUs yet, near term uses include thermal sensing, on chip heat monitoring and low power. **Source:** [MIT](https://news.mit.edu/2026/mit-engineers-design-structures-compute-with-heat-0129#:~:text=The%20structures%20performed%20computations%20with,need%20to%20be%20tiled%20together.)",

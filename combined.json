Our reverse engineering of their in-DRAM Rowhammer mitigations reveals more sophisticated protection mechanisms, which resist all known Rowhammer patterns. To identify blind spots in the new mitigations, we conducted a series of carefully designed experiments, which revealed that the mitigation does not sample certain refresh intervals. This allowed us to craft two novel Rowhammer patterns that effectively bypass these deployed mitigations. >... **Results** >We test our Phoenix attack patterns on 15 DDR5 DIMMs from SK Hynix, manufactured between the end of 2021 and the end of 2024. We found that all 15 DIMMs are vulnerable to exactly one of the two patterns. Generally, the shorter pattern (128 tREFI intervals) is 2.62x more effective than the longer pattern (2608 tREFI intervals), leading to 4989 bit flips on average. We also analyzed the practical exploitability of these bit flips across three previously shown attacks targeting (i) page-table entries (PTEs) to craft an arbitrary memory read/write primitive (all DIMMs are vulnerable); (ii) RSA-2048 keys of a co-located VM to break SSH authentication (73% of vulnerable DIMMs); and (iii) the sudo binary to escalate local privileges to the root user (33% of vulnerable DIMMs). To demonstrate the real-world practicality, we reproduced the privilege escalation exploit from [Rubicon](https://github.com/comsec-group/rubicon) for the first time on DDR5 DIMMs and demonstrated that the average time to exploitation is just 5 minutes and 19 seconds.",

When you see thousands and thousands getting laid off at every company and Microsoft closing down studios that they just bought, it's great to see Nintendo rarely firing employees in the news. There was also the instance of Nintendo's CEO cutting his salary for the good of the company and it's employees during the bad times. I have no issue paying extra to a company that treats their employees right and doesn't view them as expendable.",

Playing gameboy games on the GBA SP was awesome, or being able to play GBA games on the DS required a whole extra slot that wasnt necessary but they did it. Classic games on the nintendo shop on wii and wii U were fairly priced at $5-$10 After a few years theyd have Nintendo Select games and lower their big games to $20 Playing Online used to be free (even tho it sucked lol) Wii Sports being included with the Wii was huge. I knew families that bought the Wii just for the sports game and probably never bought any other games When they had games that required the N64 expansion pack they included it with the game (DK64) Or when they introduced the Wii motion+ attachement it was included with Skyward Sword Theres things they did before that they would absolutely nickle and dime you on today. Not saying they were perfect but i thought they were player friendly for the most part",

GCN sold 22m in its lifetime. It's competitors, the Xbox and PS2, sold 24m and over 150m respectively. They needed gamecubes to move off the shelves so they discounted it to a degree where they took a huge loss, hoping to make it up in software sales. \"we got Nintendo Classics for CHEAP during the late Wii and Wii U era\" Yeah by the end of its life the Wii was selling like garbage (I was working in video game retail at the time, and yeah we couldn't give them away by the end) and the Wii U was a colossal failure at 13m units sold in its lifetime. They needed incentives for people to buy more, and thats how they handled it during THAT downward spin. \"They used to have gold coins for switch sales\" yeah because they were frigging TERRIFIED of people not catching onto the Switch at first and needed to drive digital sales so the Switch looked like a competent modern console that was up to par in the digital purchase sector. The closest thing Nintendo did to something that was very \"giving\" to consumers was when they started the Voucher system in mid 2019, and that can easily be pointed to as giving people a small discount in exchange for furthering the Switch's appeal as a game console where the games were as good digitally as they were physically. People just like outrage, just forget them and play your games <3",

S1 definitely kept me busy for 7 years but if I look at the some of my favorite games they were mostly indie and then a few 1st party titles like Fire Emblem, Kirby, and Link's Awakening. Mario Odyssey and BOTW/TOTK, while nice games weren't among my favorite from their respective franchises nor was Origami King among my favorite Paper Marios. But with Switch 2 I've already played a game that I would consider for GOTY (DK Bananza) and quite a few great 3rd party experiences like Cyberpunk, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, Yakuza 0, and Hitman: World of Assassination. I'm genuinely enjoying these games and making sure that I get my money's worth by not rushing quickly onto the next one. I'm also playing S2 in handheld more, due to the larger screen and sturdier build, whereas with my S1 I played almost exclusively docked. I'm very optimistic about a much more well-rounded lineup of games this time around so how are you guys enjoying your S2s so far and what are your favorite aspects of it?",

        "text_content": "As you may have heard, everything is terrible. However, I have crossed these troubled lands to bring you some positive headlines, so gather round and I shall share them with you now. * After one of the most tortuous announcement to release processes of all time, **Metroid Prime 4 finally has a release date** \\- and it's less than 3 months from now. On Dec 4th, you will be able to play the first new Prime game in nearly two decades. If you like Metroid, That. Is. Amazing! * And talking of long waits...after 7 long years, **Hollow Knight: Silksong, the most hotly anticipated indie game of all time, has actually released**. And not only has it released, it's good. Very good. It's hard as fuck, but it's good. And it's cheap. You can get it for a mere $20! How amazing is that?! * In further positive pricing news, **Final Fantasy VII Remake will be just $40 - including its expansive DLC**! We're talking 50-60 hours of big, juicy AAA goodness and the chance to play one of the most storied games in history for just $40. AND it's been confirmed that parts two and three of the remade trilogy will be coming to Switch 2 too! * And those are far from the only big AAA games on the way. **Resident Evil Re9uiem and 007: First Light have both been announced as day and date releases on Switch 2**. This sort of thing never happened on Switch 1. These are huge new releases and they're coming day 1 - *and* they look good. * We can look forward to them with a fair degree of confidence, of course, because **Star Wars: Outlaws, an infamously demanding game, has just released on Switch 2 and runs well**. Nobody thought it would. Right up to release day. But it does. And it's massively improved from its original state - and if it can run well, it bodes well for plenty of other future releases, like Indiana Jones and Elden Ring (because, yeah, Indiana Jones and Elden Ring are on the way too). * And on the topic of future releases, not including Prime 4, the **upcoming first-party line-up** consists of: a new Pokemon Legends game *and* a new Pokemon spin-off, a new Splatoon spin-off, a new Fire Emblem game, a new Mario Tennis, a new Hyrule Warriors, a new Yoshi game, and Kirby AirRiders, a follow-up to a cult GameCube game that no one ever thought would be revived - but is being so in a big way with an unusually large marketing push and the full weight of the legendary Masahiro Sakurai. Now, of course, it's not all sunshine and rainbows, we all know that, but maybe take a step back from the doommongering and look around now and then. Yes, DK Bananza's DLC might be a few dollars more than you feel it's worth, but...look, look at all this! Wake up and smell the roses - or at least just look at them, they're all around you.",

While multifamily permits ticked up, the sector\u2019s volatility leaves the outlook uncertain. The split underscores a housing market still under strain, with single-family softness weighing on broader growth prospects. Over the first seven months of 2025, the total number of single-family permits issued year-to-date (YTD) nationwide reached 565,208. On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, this is a decline of 5.7% over the July 2024 level of 599,308. For multifamily, the total number of permits issued nationwide reached 286,836. This is 2.6% higher compared to the July 2024 level of 279,618. Year-to-date ending in July, single-family permits were up in one out of the four regions. The Midwest posted a small increase of 2.0%. The Northeast was 2.5% lower, the South was down by 6.6%, and the West was down by 8.3% in single-family permits during this time. For multifamily permits, three out of the four regions posted increases. The Midwest was up by 23.3%, the West was up by 5.9%, and the South was up by 5.7%, Meanwhile, the Northeast declined steeply by 26.8%, driven by the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ MSA which declined by 38.0%. Between July 2025 YTD and July 2024 YTD, 16 states posted an increase in single-family permits. The range of increases spanned 18.1% in Hawaii to 0.5% in New Jersey. The remaining 34 states and the District of Columbia reported declines in single-family permits with the District of Columbia reporting the steepest decline of 28.8%. The ten states issuing the highest number of single-family permits combined accounted for 62.8% of the total single-family permits issued. Texas, the state with the highest number of single-family permits, issued 90,561 permits over the first seven months of 2025; this is a decline of 7.2% compared to the same period last year. The second highest state, Florida, decreased by 11.9%, while the third highest, North Carolina, posted a decline of 2.2%. Between July 2025 YTD and July 2024 YTD, 29 states recorded growth in multifamily permits, while 21 states and the District of Columbia recorded a decline. Mississippi (+97.3%) led the way with a sharp rise in multifamily permits from 222 to 438, while Wyoming had the largest decline of 53.1% from 196 to 92. The ten states issuing the highest number of multifamily permits combined accounted for 61.6% of the multifamily permits issued. Over the first seven months of 2025, Florida, the state with the highest number of multifamily permits issued, experienced an increase of 23.8%. Texas, the second-highest state in multifamily permits, saw an increase of 10.9%. California, the third largest multifamily issuing state, increased by 5.8%.",

Over the past year, [many scientists have voiced concerns](https://www.nature.com/articles/d44151-025-00003-7) over experiments that might lead to the creation of such cells, suggesting that they would pose an enormous risk to human health and the environment. \u201cPretty much everybody agrees\u201d that mirror-image cells would be \u201ca bad thing\u201d, says John Glass, a synthetic biologist at the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, California. But there are disagreements about where to draw lines to limit research on mirror-image biology, given the potential benefits of such studies.\"",

Imagine an invasive bacterial species that even dead doesn't degrade since nothing can consume it. Free to reproduce with absolutely no predators, in our oceans, in our lakes, in our food supply, and worse, in our blood. Essentially invisible to our immune system due to it's chirality, it would reproduce until it clogged our blood vessels. Even as our bodies decayed, there would be mats of it remaining on our bones.",

The plot is that Chloe (who is a character from the first game) is aware of everything that happened in all the other games? She develops powers (she can stop time) and she goes with the main character who can rewind time and jump between times or something like that. The game is about making choices that affect the rest of the game. The more important choices is choosing whether you agree with the villain or not. If you want to save people or join the villain. If you want to date the main character of the last game or stay with your new boyfriend. If you want to drug someone or not. If you want to stop someone (I think a girl) from jumping off a building or something like that. If you can convince other characters from other games to join you with the villain or against the villain. The final decision of the game is to save the main character (I think the main character of the last game, not Chloe) or to let the city be destroyed by the villains.",

I thought the trend would die out like HairWorks did. It got better over time. DLSS 2.x felt like a major hurdle had been passed. And I thought okay maybe it's not so bad; maybe they'll never convincingly feign higher resolutions but if upscalers can visually outperform the lower render resolutions at the same or higher FPS, that's useful. Intel/Radeon/NVIDIA now all offer something capable of doing that. But now we've reached a point where some upscalers can feign the higher resolutions frighteningly well. DLSS4.5 does 360p->720p while looking basically the same as 720p 9xSSAA (in other words 4k downsampled to 720p). If you think how many pixels are involved in the former and the latter, it's an insane result. And this behavior transfers to higher resolutions too, actually works even better there since artifacts are harder to notice the more pixels there are in total. Skepticism was absolutely warranted, once. I was a skeptic. And upscalers today still have room for improvement. But at this point dismissing upscalers out of hand feels less like a technical perspective more like stubbornly dying on a stupid hill that no longer makes any sense. You can see as much in the video where the \"native is king\" raw 360p looks worse than even the worst upscaler alternatives.",

Beyond Good & Evil 2 continues to make headlines as the longest-in-development title ever, having been in development since its reveal on May 30, 2008, with a total of 6445 days at the time of writing, or, for those who hate math, 17 years, 7 months, and 22 days. However, the current version of the game has been in development since around 2017, which still means a good 8-9 years of development. Regardless of records and long-ass development timelines, though, Ubisoft still thinks that Beyond Good & Evil 2 has something to give. Despite the recent restructuring that has seen six games cancelled, including the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake, sources tell Insider Gaming that Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still in active development, at least for the time being. In 2023, Beyond Good & Evil 2 saw significant changes with Ubisoft Montpellier being under investigation \u201cover an unprecedented number of developers experiencing burnout and going on sick leave.\u201d According to sources, constant changes, pushbacks, and the lengthy development time have likely cost Ubisoft $500+ million in development costs. But, at least for the time being, Ubisoft feels like it\u2019s a cost that is justified.",

Fortunately it does seem like Nintendo and its old heads have by and large done a pretty solid job of making sure there's capable hands ready to take over for them and hopefully make the transition relatively smooth. Tanabe for instance shouts out Risa Tabata as someone who's likely to produce any future Prime games (she notably produced the Thousand-Year Door remake, which is a series Tanabe's usually attached to)",

The report provides the real estate ecosystem \u2013 including agents and homebuyers and sellers \u2013 with data on the level of home sales under contract. Month-over-month pending home sales declined in all four regions. Year-over-year pending home sales rose in the South and declined in the Northeast, Midwest and West. \u201cThe housing sector is not out of the woods yet,\u201d said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. \u201cAfter several months of encouraging signs in pending contracts and closed sales, the December new contract figures have dampened the short-term outlook.\u201d \u201cEven after accounting for typical seasonal patterns, interpreting in-person home search activity in the winter \u2013 especially in December \u2013 can be tricky due to public holidays, people taking time off, and wintry weather conditions,\u201d Yun added. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching the data in the coming months to determine whether the soft contract signings were a one-month aberration or the start of an underlying trend.\u201d \u201cData shows closing activity increased in December. However, new listings did not keep pace so inventory decreased. Consumers prefer seeing abundant inventory before making the major decision of purchasing a home. So, the decline in pending home sales could be a result of dampened consumer enthusiasm about buying a home when there are so few options listed for sale. In December there were only 1.18 million homes on the market \u2013 matching the lowest inventory level of 2025.\u201d December 2025 Regional Pending Home Sales Northeast - 11.0% decrease month over month - 3.6% decrease year over year Midwest - 14.9% decrease month over month - 9.8% decrease year over year South - 4.0% decrease month over month - 2.0% increase year over year West - 13.3% decrease month over month - 5.1% decrease year over year While national pending home sales dipped in December, several local markets are showing notable year-over-year gains. Among the 50 largest metro areas, the following 10 markets posted the biggest annual increases in pending home sales, according to data from Realtor.com Economics: - Louisville/Jefferson County, KY-IN (+23.8%) - San Antonio\u2013New Braunfels, TX (+13.6%) - Virginia Beach\u2013Chesapeake\u2013Norfolk, VA-NC (+11.0%) - Charlotte\u2013Concord\u2013Gastonia, NC-SC (+9.7%) - Boston\u2013Cambridge\u2013Newton, MA-NH (+9.2%) - Phoenix\u2013Mesa\u2013Chandler, AZ (+8.7%) - Oklahoma City, OK (+8.0%) - Miami\u2013Fort Lauderdale\u2013West Palm Beach, FL (+6.3%) - Pittsburgh, PA (+5.8%) - Memphis, TN-MS-AR (+4.7%)",

The documentary, which is now unavailable because the source set it to private, confirms 343 investigated Unreal Engine for Halo Infinite in 2017 for a few months. They held a vote with leadership who voted 85% in favor of Slipspace mainly because it would\u2019ve taken at least 2 years to develop the foundation of Infinite in Unreal. Also, their investigation proved that the Halo feel can be recreated in Unreal Engine which is a good sign for future Halo games.

                "raw_content": "Stocks rose on Wednesday as the latest trade developments spurred optimism on Wall Street that the U.S. would reach more deals before its impending tariff deadline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 507.85 points, or 1.14%, ending at 45,010.29 and missing a record close by about four points. The S&P 500 climbed 0.78% for a record close of 6,358.91 \u2014 its 12th of the year. The broad-market index also hit a new all-time intraday high in the session. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.61%, settling at 21,020.02 \u2014 its first close above the 21,000 threshold. Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday night that the U.S. had completed a \"massive Deal\" with Japan. The agreement includes \"reciprocal\" tariffs of 15% on the nation's exports to the U.S. The president also said the U.S. is meeting with European officials in a push to reach a trade deal with the European Union. Stocks received a bit of a boost later Wednesday after the Financial Times reported that the U.S. is closing in on a 15% tariff agreement with the European Union, saying that it would echo the U.S.-Japan deal. Bloomberg also confirmed the progress between the U.S. and the EU, citing diplomats briefed on the negotiations. The U.S. has been looking to reach trade deals with other countries ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline. Earlier this week, the White House revealed that the U.S. and Indonesia agreed to the framework of a trade agreement. That follows a number of other trade agreements the U.S. has reached with other countries, including China and the United Kingdom. The developments come after Trump on April 2 sent markets into turmoil, with his announcement of sweeping levies that he then pushed off. \"So far, the tariff strategy Trump is pursuing looks very inspired, generating serious income, resulting in major investments in the U.S. to avoid the tariffs, and has yet to cause the disruptions and inflation that the naysayers said were certain,\" said Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer at Navellier & Associates. \"The stock market certainly reflects no fear of negative consequences.\" Wednesday's moves follow a second straight day concluding at a high for the S&P 500.",

In one segment of the game, Amelia appears as a supporting character depicted as a far-right, anti-immigration activist. She is portrayed with distinctive goth or e-girl aesthetics, including purple hair, a pink dress, and a purple sweater, and attempts to persuade the player to join her cause by expressing views critical of mass immigration and advocating for cultural preservation. Intended as an antagonist meant to illustrate the dangers of such ideologies (with \"wrong\" choices potentially leading to a simulated Prevent referral), the character unexpectedly backfired. Online communities, particularly on the political right, reclaimed Amelia and transformed her into a positive symbol - turning her into a mascot for anti-immigration sentiment.",

I personally got like 1-2 chapters from the end and just kind of...stopped caring about what happened next and haven't gone back to finish it. I probably should, because I liked some of what it was doing, but hated a lot of it, too. FFVII Remake is going to consume more of your time, especially depending on how much of it you choose to engage with. If you get into it and want to see all the game has to offer, it's easily a 60+ hour game. Dispatch takes about 10 to get through. Then again, if you're going to be playing ACNH primarily, something that you dive into and spend a lot of time with might not be what you're after. Hope this helps!",

It includes listings data, price data, rental data, demographics data, mortgage data, census data....about 100 metrics in total.

How much of this unlocked productivity is about to be thrown away on vanity projects the same way most software engineering always has been, without addressing the needs of users or finding an audience or an economic profit-making point? 2) Validating the answers - having a dream that AI can happily churn away on doesn't mean you can recognize a good answer when it appears, or design a good spec to instruct your AI to reach.

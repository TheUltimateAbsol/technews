Even when you're pushing it in Black Myth Wukong at \\~40W it's at \\~60c and in God of War Ragnarok at \\~65W it's at \\~75c, (this is with the battery pack) though probably at high RPM/noise (wasn't measured). At 25W, GPU loaded you can get 2x the performance of regular Strix (Z2E, HX370). If not GPU bound for ex., performance isn't that much different in Space Marines to \\~20% in Returnal. Cary finds that diminishing returns for Strix is at \\~18W and Halo \\~45W. Also, Strix is running Bazzite while Halo, Win11, no tuning for either (for a later video). Lighter games, 2D games like Celeste, it can impressively go at \\~6W package and \\~10W total system. Total system can go lower if fan scaling is exposed, Cary suggest if it's at 40c, fans should be able to shut off. The Asus system he tested could go down to \\~7W total system. Though, since this is a first look, there isn't a direct comparison to LNL, which excels at this power envelope. Speaking of low power, this really intrigues me on potential power behaviour for Zen6 desktop (hopefully high idle and in low workloads is gone). Halo impresses again, but pricing is obviously expensive. Cary has some interesting points to suggest otherwise, though, there isn't much else to comment about it as it's been repeated countless times by what people think about Strix Halo pricing.",

Seems like you gotta heat it up with the CPU to melt it and keep tightening the cooler while doing so so you can have better boundary layer. But imho, the biggest part why LM pad isn't a thing is simply because regular paste is good enough. Majority of customers aren't looking for the bleeding edge, they just want a good enough daily driver. There's virtually no difference between a 67\u00baC CPU and 60\u00baC CPU nowadays too.",

Besides, my desktop GPU peaks at high 50s (undervolted, de-shrouded with Lian Li P28s, and pasted with PTM7950), mostly staying in the low-mid 50s. I can't think of a single good reason to 'paste' my card with something that boils at 50-60c. Of course, laptop users are a different story.

This was built out of a mix of brand new and used/refurbished parts, hunted plenty of deals throughout the year on most of the parts (such as 9800X3D for \u00a3260 off Aliexpress, open box stock from Overclockers UK of the 9070 XT Nitro for \u00a3569 (9070 XT MSRP and significantly below Nitro's MSRP), 64GB Kingston Fury RGB DDR5 kit for \u00a3100, Arctic LFIII 360 A-RGB for \u00a350, refurbished MSI X670E Tomahawk for \u00a3145 off eBay and Antec Flux case off Computer Orbit for \u00a384). Total cost of pretty much the entire PC sans the storage came out around \u00a31350, quite a bit of PC for that kind of money if I'd say so (and also not compromising on the aesthetics either IMO with this classy, non over the top look), and runs incredibly cool and quite all around under load.

        "text_content": "Got that old beast for the MSRP back in 2017 during the first week of launch before the prices skyrocketed because of the GPU shortage caused by mining back then, 500\u20ac, added the morpheus 2 plus a couple of fans and it was such a blast, it ran titles like XCOM 2, hitman 2, Outer worlds l, Kingdome Come and many others like a champ, hell, was still very decent to play oblivion remastered! And it was an undervolting beast too, I would usually run it with only 1.08v instead of the original 1.2, and still would be able to put the memory clock to 1050Mhz! Which is absurd bandwidth considering the huge bus that HBM memory rocks(2048bit). The only down side was the clunky nature of that build, the heatsink on the voltage controlers wouldn't stick so I used zip ties and an elastic band to keep it tight in place, which would destroy over time because of the heat of course, and then make the card unable to maintain its performance(mind you, the last elastic survived 3 years before breaking!). Loved that card, really worth every penny, one of the best investments I ever made in computer parts, lots of fun to play with its clocks and voltages ... But I wanted the newer games to run more steadily on my 1440p, so I finally caved in to replace it now that I think a sizable upgrade for a good price is available with the 9060 XT. I just tried it a little bit and it really feels like a proper upgrade, for just 350\u20ac! Am glad I took the 16Gb by the way seeing how Oblivion remastered easily uses 12Gb of VRAM, and even Mordhau eats more 9Gb and I've seen RDR2 eat more than 13Gb ... Impressed by the silence while running too, but not impressed by the plane taking off noise when manually putting the fans at full speed, lmao, my good'ol Vega was always silent even with its fans at top speed ... Is it weird to be attached to a GPU? \ud83e\udd72 By the way, question for any GNU/Linux users who might be reading this, is there a way to change the core frequency? CoreControl used to allow me to adjust core frequency and voltage steps on my Vega 64, seems to only allow OC of the Vram and change in voltage with the RX 9060 XT as per the fifth image",

I was wearing a Rockman Tee & Hate and he was like \"Nice Hat! Be on the look out for a new Mega Man game\". Me thinking he's Bass.EXE went \"Star Force Legacy Collection?!?\" Confused as Bass isn't in it. He looked back caught and we \"...ugh don't think that one\" I said \"Battle Network Legacy Collection came out last year did you do lines for it? He was confused a bit and said \"Ah well\" and changed the subject It is worth noting that Capcom brought Matt Hill back to reprise his role as Bass.EXE in the mobile trading card game *Teppen* in December 2024. Those voice lines can be heard [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzVkx6Rpmd0). That said, this was specifically for Bass.EXE, the *Battle Network* incarnation of the character. The classic series version of Bass hasn't had an English counterpart since 1996, so it would stand to reason that Capcom may have looped in Hill for role.",

        "score": 0,
        "text_content": "I ran the numbers properly, and this isn\u2019t opinion or doomposting. This is exactly what the stats in the report are saying. The UK housing market is not \u201ccooling\u201d, \u201cresetting\u201d, or \u201cpausing\u201d. It is structurally jammed. Prices are barely up at around 3% year-on-year, which is below inflation, so in real terms prices are already going backwards. At the same time, transaction volumes are down roughly 37%. That combination matters. Prices are being quoted in a market where hardly anyone is actually buying or selling. That means prices are no longer being discovered by a functioning market. They are just the last number agreed by a very small group of people who still can transact The report\u2019s stress index puts the national market in the top decile of stress compared to the last three years. That is not normal. Volatility is extremely high across most regions, not because prices are booming, but because so few sales are happening that each sale moves the average. Over 80% of areas show extreme fragmentation between property types. Flats, terraces, semis, and detached houses are no longer moving together. That only happens when credit conditions bite and the buyer pool fractures. In a healthy market, everything moves roughly in sync. Here, it doesn\u2019t, because the market itself is broken Mortgage activity is the core failure. Mortgage transaction volumes have collapsed to the worst historical percentile in the data. This is the engine of the housing ladder, and it is not sputtering, it is off. First-time buyers cannot enter in meaningful numbers, movers cannot chain, and anyone relying on selling to buy is stuck. Cash buyers are not a sign of strength here. The report shows cash is not surging because of confidence; it is filling gaps left by mortgage withdrawal in narrow segments. That produces artificial price support without real liquidity. This is how markets freeze before they reprice, not how they recover People point to low repossessions as proof there is no stress. The report directly contradicts that comfort story. Repossessions look low because transactions are low. Distress is being delayed by fixed-rate mortgages, term extensions, and households absorbing pain rather than moving. That does not remove stress; it stores it. When turnover is this low, the marginal seller eventually sets the price, not the average homeowner sitting tight. Thin markets flip suddenly because there is no depth underneath the headline number This is why the housing ladder is dead. The ladder assumes liquidity, credit availability, and smooth price discovery. None of those conditions exist. You cannot \u201cmove up\u201d when you cannot sell. You cannot sell when buyers cannot borrow. And you cannot trust prices when they are being set by a tiny, unrepresentative slice of the market. The report does not describe a stable plateau. It describes a market held together by low volume, delayed distress, and denial. That is not a foundation. That is a warning.

As noted in the discussion (and Terry Tao's blog), the AI provided a **\"creative and elegant generalization\"** of a 1959 paper. It's effectively generating a new mathematical insight rather than just retrieving existing literature. It bridges the **gap** between **\"AI as a Search Engine\"** and **\"AI as a Researcher.\"** **Source: Terry Tao's Blog** \ud83d\udd17: https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2025/12/08/the-story-of-erdos-problem-126/",

The only thing I could try to communicate was that, despite the AI not directly proving a previously-unknown result, we had a moment of \u201clooking at what the AI actually did provoked some productive thought\u201d rather than just \u201clooking at what the AI actually did provoked a general sense of anticlimax\u201d, and hence did contribute in a meaningful way to the ultimately new result (said new result was essentially finding the right two arguments to mash together, but that unexpected connection itself is what\u2019s elegant) and > It\u2019s tempting to imagine a binary, an uncrossable chasm between AI surfacing old ideas and AI discovering new big ideas. It may instead happen that there is a continuum where AI gives slight creative nudges via tweaking existing ideas, then eventually discovering new small ideas, before finally discovering new big ideas. There is a vast space of possible forms of human-AI collaboration in between, and this was a fun instance of AI\u2019s participation in the discussion feeling particularly human.",

        "text_content": "I've spent two years hearing \"diffusion won't work for text\" and honestly started believing it. Then this dropped today. Ant Group open sourced LLaDA 2.0, a 100B model that doesn't predict the next token. It works like BERT on steroids: masks random tokens, then reconstructs the whole sequence in parallel. First time anyone's scaled this past 8B. Results are wild. 2.1x faster than Qwen3 30B, beats it on HumanEval and MBPP, hits 60% on AIME 2025. Parallel decoding finally works at scale. The kicker: they didn't train from scratch. They converted a pretrained AR model using a phased trick. Meaning existing AR models could potentially be converted. Let that sink in. If this scales further, the left to right paradigm that's dominated since GPT 2 might actually be on borrowed time. Anyone tested it yet? Benchmarks are one thing but does it feel different?",

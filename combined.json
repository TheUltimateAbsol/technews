Android OEMs are just in a race to the bottom in cutting costs. Even flagships. The microSD card slot wasn't removed to upsell storage (many Android OEMS have a history of not even offering bigger storage in some markets) but for the half a cent per unit it saves them. Magnets are expensive and even flagship Android consumers have demonstrated tighter purse strings than Apple consumers. They all oscillate in a given year on what they're cutting to reduce costs. A few years ago QHD screens basically disappeared. iPhone style 1.5k screens began being produced by the Chinese, so resolution has at least finally gone back up a little. We've had memory and storage cuts from 2020-2023 on a lot of flagships, too. Integrated magnets is just a BOM cost most Android OEMs don't want to add. Google is cheaping out so much on the SoC they seemed to have been able to justify adding them. Hopefully it pushes Samsung to eventually add magnets as well.",

Instead, the comments usually devolve into low effort \"Drumpf Bad\", \"China is so amazing why are they being bullied\", \"Trump is saving America\", shit slinging that's overly partisan or overtly propagandized - straight up debating the existence of there even being a tech war between the west and China.

Thanks to Jon Stevens from [Hot Aisle](https://hotaisle.xyz/) to run the OpenCL benchmarks on the brand new hardware! \ud83d\udd96\ud83d\ude0a * AMD MI355X features 288GB VRAM capacity at 8TB/s bandwidth * Nvidia B200 features 180GB VRAM capacity at 8TB/s bandwidth In single-GPU benchmarks, both GPUs perform about the same, as the benchmark is bandwidth-bound. But in 8x GPU configuration, MI355X is 65% faster. The difference comes from PCIe bandwidth - MI355X achieves 55GB/s, B200 has some issues and only achieves 14GB/s. And Nvidia leaves a lot of performance on the table by not exposing NVLink P2P copy to OpenCL.

        "text_content": "I adore Pikmin 4. It is one of my favorite switch games, and probably in my top 15 games ever. Pikmin might be in my top 5 video game franchises of all time. I like pikmin so much, I played the stupid mobile game for years because I enjoyed just looking at Pikmin. 4 does not have a lot of problems at all. But the problems that are there\u2026 are bad. Auto lock might be my least favorite thing about this game, especially coming off of 3. Despite the gyro for 3 being weird and inconsistent at times, it is far superior to fiddling with the auto lock. There needs to be an option to turn it off. Apart from the very final cave, this game also falls into the trap of being too easy. As much as I love Oatchi from both a design and gameplay perspective, I\u2019d be lying if I said he didn\u2019t throw off the games entire balance. He\u2019s just too good. A hard mode would make repeat playthroughs even more fun than they currently are. Pikmin 4\u2019s co-op is terrible. Pikmin 3\u2019s co-op is incredible. Just let player 2 play as Oatchi, and this game would probably turn into one of my favorite couch co-op games. Finally, graphics. Pikmin 4 is a very good looking game, especially for switch. But on any consoles other than switch, it would have been gorgeous. Having this game running at anything higher than 1080p would allow its visuals to shine so much more. Again, I love this game to death, and that\u2019s why I want these changes. If these things were added, it would be nearly perfect in my opinion.",

My favourite thing about Pikmin 1 is, controversially, the time limit. It's generous enough that you don't truly have a threat of losing your save, but tight enough that it encourages you to engage in smart multitasking and planning. Pikmin 4 doesn't really have stakes, and the dog makes everything VERY forgiving. There's no time limit, there's no need to strategize too deeply because you can slowly just brute-force most problems. I had the most fun with the very cool endgame missions (I won't spoil them). I would love to get a Switch 2 update that smoothed out performance but, more importantly, gave some new challenges to play through. The mechanics are incredible in Pikmin 4, and having some really meaty stages that made you smartly engage with all of them could potentially make it my favourite game in the series.",

        "score": 240,
        "text_content": "This material was obtained through internal sources familiar with the project's development and represents the complete narrative design for the single-player campaign. This saga is a massive, high-stakes crossover that deals with the fate of the spiritual world itself. \u200bThe Core Crisis: The Harmonic Rift \u200bThe entire story is built around a monumental spiritual threat: the Harmonic Rift, a tear in the fabric of reality that originated when Avatar Wan first sealed Vaatu, the Spirit of Chaos, inside the Tree of Time. This rift is ruled by a chaotic new spirit named Dhukah (the spirit of impermanence), who intends to use the growing chaos to free and merge with Vaatu, thus ending all reality. \u200bBook 1: Attachment \u200bThe Set-up: Avatars Aang (struggling with his moral choice before facing Ozai) and Korra (recovering from emotional trauma) are both grappling with inner doubt when they are separately approached by the spirit Dhukah. \u200bThe Pull: Dhukah lures the Avatars into the Harmonic Rift, a dimension where time and geography are fractured, promising to connect them. \u200bThe Antagonist: They encounter Yuka, a waterbender who was a pirate from Avatar Kyoshi's era. Yuka now serves Dhukah and uses a unique fighting style combining ancient waterbending with modern Korra-era technology. \u200bClimax: Aang and Korra finally achieve a physical meeting, but the spiritual link between them causes the Rift to destabilize, pulling all their most strongly-connected friends and foes into the chaos. \u200bBook 2: Imbalance \u200bForced Teams: Heroes are separated and forced into desperate, cross-era teams in the shifting reality: \u200bKatara, Zuko, and Zaheer find themselves together at the Northern Water Tribe. \u200bToph, Lin Beifong, and Uncle Iroh are thrown together, with the mother and daughter constantly clashing. \u200bAang meets his future son, Tenzin, and they journey together. \u200bThe Vaatu Connection: When Korra faces Yuka, she feels a strange, malicious pull inside her\u2014the spirit of Vaatu stirring prematurely, confirming the urgency of the threat. \u200bBook 3: Imbalance (Part 2) \u200bThe Clashes: The teams converge on Republic City, battling Anchors (shadow versions of characters that manifest from psychological weaknesses) to stabilize the Rift. \u200bMajor Confrontations: Tenzin and the Korra-era characters recognize and confront Zaheer. Korra fights Azula, telling the disgraced princess she sees her own shattered confidence reflected in Azula's eyes. \u200bThe Avatar Showdown: Avatar Kyoshi makes her entrance and demands Aang and Korra attack and destroy Dhukah immediately. A philosophical conflict ensues between Kyoshi and Aang, culminating in them both entering the Avatar State and fighting each other, which destabilizes the Rift and buries Aang, Korra, and Katara deeper into the chaos. \u200bBook 4: Dharma \u200bSearching for Answers: The remaining heroes seek a way to break through Dhukah's defenses. Tenzin and Iroh travel to Wan Shi Tong's Library to research the spirit of impermanence. \u200bThe Ultimate Price: Aang is guided by Avatar Wan in the Spirit Wilds. Korra is forced into a confrontation where Vaatu emerges from her thousands of years ahead of time, merging with the sealed spirit. Zaheer is horrified at the chaotic tyrant he helped create, while Aang and Korra are banished into the Void. \u200bKyoshi's Choice: Kyoshi and Toph confront Yuka. Kyoshi declares this is her fight and sacrifices herself to completely remove Yuka from the Rift, intentionally leaving her own final destiny unclear. \u200bBook 5: Impermanence (The End) \u200bThe Void: Katara plunges herself into the Void of Impermanence and is guided by her love for Aang to find him and Korra. \u200bThe Final Truth: Guided by the voice of Guru Pathik, Aang and Korra realize they cannot beat Dhukah while spiritually connected\u2014they were brought here by their shared doubt. \u200bPurification: Aang and Korra sever their spiritual link and, fighting individually, they assail Dhukah from different timelines. In the final stage, they use their power to purify Dhukah (similar to how Korra purified dark spirits). \u200bResolution: With Dhukah purified, Vaatu\u2014who is not yet 100% restored\u2014cannot maintain the Rift, and it begins to unravel. All characters are sent back to their original timelines after a final farewell, leaving Aang and Korra confident they can face their respective futures.",

That's when they start lashing out with physical violence. That's because they don't have any other way to get people to do what they want. You'll see it in individuals, like a family member who suddenly gets violent at home. You'll see it in governments and in entities like WEF who suddenly and viciously crack down on their people.

Ari is a former Housemarque dev (now Epic Games) who worked on Returnal a UE4 title which performs really amazingly at the same time as maintaining high fidelity graphics. 0:05 / 0:40 [https://youtu.be/HaVTYSnGvxA?si=\\_ReosZvPZjCK9M5D&t=787](https://youtu.be/HaVTYSnGvxA?si=_ReosZvPZjCK9M5D&t=787) At ***13:07*** Ari mentions the Fast-Geo Streaming Plug-in which CDPR made and shipped for UE5.6 developers to use, its a level streaming plugin that eliminates stutter by streaming in and out assets rapidly, they also used it in the Witcher 4 Tech Demo and its the same thing to TurboTECH you might've already heard about. 0:00 / 0:31 This is basically what almost every developer does even on their own Engines, CDPR's RED Engine was the same method. BTW if you didn't know, Console games that are Pre-Compiled already are shipped with it in the game, since all PS5's run the same hardware as eachother, since all Xbox Series S and X use the same hardware as eachother. PC's however have immeasurable configurations hence why PC games need to precompile on your first start up. Developers who neglect Pre-Compilation on modern DX11 and DX12 games are basically setting you up as a player for a PSO/Shader stuttering mess where your hardware it fighting the graphics in a race on who can render what in real time. So don't use the engine as a scapegoat even if its a different engine like their own proprietary in-house, blame the studio themselves for cutting basic QA. If you have any questions I (u/[MrFrostPvP-](https://www.reddit.com/user/MrFrostPvP-/)) can try answer them, I'm fairly informed when it comes to tech stuff like this and I've been kept up to date with CDPR and Epic's collaborations since 2022. As you can see on this sub I have a post pinned clearing up any fearmongering you may have when it comes to game graphics or game optimisation even relative to CDPR's Witcher 4.",

She\u2019s been slashing prices. But months of chatter about AI taking jobs and tariffs tanking the economy is feeding into buyer indecision. \u201cPeople say price solves everything,\u201d Baker said. \u201cBut price doesn\u2019t solve uncertainty.\u201d Spring is traditionally the busiest season in real estate, not unlike Christmas for retailers. And while the most unaffordable housing market in decades has sidelined all but the most determined buyers, there were signs earlier this year that conditions were right for a rebound. By April, mortgage rates dipped, price growth flattened and the years-long inventory drought looked like it had finally broken. But that coincided with President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff bombshell, which sent shock waves through financial markets and pushed house hunters back into hiding. Fewer sales contracts were signed in the US from April through June than in any year since 2012, according to data from Redfin. That was back when the housing market was still finding its footing after the collapse that fueled the financial crisis. Before 2025, the previous two springs were also weak, pulled down by high rates and prices, but anxiety over the future of the economy has made things worse this time, said Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the brokerage. Prices, however, are unlikely to plunge because sellers are starting to pull listings off the market, limiting inventory, she said. \u201cWe thought we hit rock bottom but we keep discovering there\u2019s more rock bottom to be had,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cYou have a lot of people being afraid of what\u2019s to come.\u201d With consumer confidence ticking up and the stock market on a hot streak, the hope is deals that normally might have happened in the spring will get pushed into summer. But there\u2019s likely to be only a small bump, according to Thomas Ryan, an economist at Capital Economics. The rental market is gaining strength because many would-be buyers still can\u2019t afford to purchase, he said. And as borrowing costs remain higher for longer, people have stopped assuming they can buy now and be able to refinance at a later date, according to Ryan. \u201cThe outlook for the housing market is dire,\u201d he said. \u201cAffordability is at its worst since the 1980s. Nothing has changed on that front.\u201d Location Matters One silver lining is that buyers have gained some negotiating power as listings climbed across much of the country. But as always in real estate, what matters most is geography. Prices continue to rise fast in the Northeast and Midwest, where inventory shortages are severe. Yet in Sun Belt markets like Florida and Texas, where homebuilders were most active in recent years, the market is sinking. In Las Vegas, active listings shot up more than 38% from a year earlier while sales plunged 15%, according to Redfin data for the four weeks through July 20. The fear of missing out has shifted from buyers to sellers, said Angela O\u2019Hare, an agent with Real Broker in the Las Vegas area. It doesn\u2019t help that sellers have to compete with homebuilders offering to subsidize mortgage rates and help cover closing costs, she said. \u201cSellers who need to sell will make it happen,\u201d O\u2019Hare said. \u201cI had a listing at $950,000. I cut it down to $799,000 and had three offers.\u201d Even some of the country\u2019s hottest markets have lost some steam. In Narragansett, a picturesque beach town in Rhode Island south of Providence, homes that would have gotten a dozen offers a year ago now get three \u2014 if they\u2019re priced right, said Johnny Sheil, an agent with Mott & Chace Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.",

        "text_content": "Going back 60 years there are two pretty clear indicators for impending recessions and stock drops: 1. [New Privately-Owned Housing Units Completed: Total Units](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/COMPUTSA) 2. [Monthly Supply of New Houses in the United States](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSACSR) I have mapped out the following lines on my own graph: 1. Housing completions (as a % of 5 year moving average) 2. Month supply of new housing (as a % of average in last 60 years) 3. S&P 500 returns adjusted for inflation (% of 3 year moving average) https://preview.redd.it/988n7yh5qoff1.png?width=2536&format=png&auto=webp&s=58fefbf0d04a0500457cdb6ad8846c31497cae20 Looking at the data it clearly shows that when new housing supply starts to increase (and is at least 30% above its MA), housing unit completions start to drop sharply against its MA and the S&P 500 has recently been 10% above its MA then it is a clear sign of an impending drop in stock prices. The 4 times this happened was: 1. November 1973 - Followed by a 34% drop in the S&P 500 2. June 1981 - Followed by a 30% drop in the S&P 500 3. April 1990 - Followed by an 15% drop in the S&P 500 4. June 2007 - Followed by a 50% drop in the S&P 500 Notice that 2022 was not triggered by this principle as while new home supply hit the threshold as well as the S&P 500, builders did not panic and building pipelines remained strong, so while this was a stock correction it was not driven by housing (evidenced by the fact housing continued to drive upwards afterwards). Fast forward to today and notice that in June there was a significant increase in supply and a very undiscussed, HUGE decrease in completed homes which now officially triggers all three thresholds. Am I offering guarantees we see a crash/correction this fall? No. Can I explain the economics of this correlation? No (I am a statistician, but my view is that homebuilders are so integrated with the mindset and sentiment of consumers via negotiations that they know before most and are the only industry with really transparent industry wide supply data...). What I am saying is that this pattern as a high correlation, it very accurately predicted crashes in the past and could be a predictor for an impending crash very soon. Also not really a \"hard science\" observation, but notice that the first three indicated stock drops were roughly 8 years apart from end of last one to start of new one.... The 2007 housing crash \"skipped\" a interval with a 16 year gap and...look at that, 16 years from the end of the 2007 crash takes us to summer 2025....",

This achievement represents an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude in both fidelity and speed over the previous record of approximately one error for every 1 million operations. Are they being purposely confusing with an already confusing topic? This summary seems to only make what happened more impactful than it was? And citing 'world record achievement'? Of course any improvement is a world record achievement. Do journalists need to label each technical advancement in any industry a world record achievement? If they must use the percentage, they could say \"Scientists reduce quantum computer error rate from 0.000100% to 0.000015% error rate.\" or \"Scientists reduce quantum computer error rate from 1 per million to 1 per 6.7 million.\"",

By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, we introduce *curved neural networks* as a class of models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing higher-order phenomena in complex networks.\"",

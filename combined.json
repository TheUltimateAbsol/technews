In early 2024, the company was criticized by the union for asking workers to [return to the office five days](https://archive.ph/o/X0HLY/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/-grand-theft-auto-maker-tells-staff-to-return-to-office-five-days-a-week) a week. Rockstar said the return to office decision was partly for security reasons. *Grand Theft Auto VI* is slated for release on May 26, 2026 and is expected to be one of the top-selling video games of all time.",

        "score": 74,
        "text_content": "So, I took a Maxsun B580 iCraft and ran it like it owed me money. Using a 3D printed mount for an LGA1156 CPU water block, I ran automotive coolant through it sitting at around \u201315C, and pushed voltage from 25mV all the way up to 70 mV. Anything past 60 bounced it off the power limit, but 50\u201355 was the sweet spot, clean scaling, no throttling, no driver tantrums. Power limit stayed maxed at 120 and core +300. It took me a long time to dial it in, but once I did she was one happy Arc. Stock clock is 2850 MHz. Under ice it held 3316 MHz sustained, +466 on the core. That's a 16% uplift! While load temps hovered around 20C. It actually set the top 4 graphics score for the B580 on Time Spy, and top overall. Briefly hitting 3350 MHz during the run. Then the coolant started warming up before I could even start the game runs, it takes 48 hours to re-chill, and by the time I hit Forza, the loop was half slush, half soup. It still pulled 16 percent average uplift in games, matching the 16 percent clock uplift. Cyberpunk 107 - 120 Forza 5 158 - 174 MHW 60 - 69 This was all on a stock card, no BIOS or any Voltage mods. After the initial 1.5 hours of tuning it took me to get there, the card never freaked out, no crashes or black screens... just quiet, consistent scaling. (Unlike Nvidia, Intel doesn't just crash the driver, the whole system restarts... annoying) I didn\u2019t expect Intel Arc to like the cold this much, especially after my last discovery with AMD. I think there\u2019s still headroom left, contact wasn\u2019t perfect, and the coolant was becoming a warm bath mid run. I will definitely have to give this thing another go... maybe in transmission fluid next time. There is a video if you want to see the excitement.

Only 28 out of every 1,000 (2.8%) U.S. homes have changed hands in 2025\u2014the lowest turnover rate in at least 30 years. That\u2019s according to a Redfin analysis of home turnover rates, based on MLS data and county records. The turnover rate is defined as the number of homes that are sold in the first nine months of the year, divided by the total number of sellable homes that exist. Our analysis examined the period between 2012-2025, but we can confidently say this year\u2019s 2.8% turnover rate is the lowest since at least the early-mid 1990s. Existing home sales back then were similar to this year, but the number of homes that existed was smaller\u2014meaning the turnover rate was higher. 38% fewer homes sold this year than during the pandemic peak This year\u2019s turnover rate (2.77%) was down ever so slightly from 2.78% last year, when existing home sales fell to the lowest level since 1995. There were 37.7% fewer homes sold this year than during the middle of the pandemic buying frenzy in 2021 (44 of every 1,000) and 31.2% fewer homes sold than during the last pre-pandemic year in 2019 (40 of every 1,000). Homes are turning over at historically low rates because: * Affordability challenges have kept many buyers on the sidelines. Home prices are near record highs and borrowing costs remain elevated, causing the number of sellers to far outweigh the number of buyers. * Sellers are unwilling to give up their low mortgage rates. More than 70% of mortgaged U.S. homeowners have a rate below 5%, well below the current rate of 6.17%. While the share of mortgages above 6% is at a 10-year high, many homeowners are still rate-locked and unwilling to sell. * Economic uncertainty has made buyers cautious. Concerns about job security, inflation, and broader instability caused many would-be movers to delay major purchases, further slowing the pace of transactions. \u201cAmerica\u2019s housing market is defined right now by caution,\u201d said Chen Zhao, Redfin\u2019s head of economics research. \u201cBuyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they\u2019re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit. Others aren\u2019t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put\u2014either because they\u2019re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations. When both sides hesitate, sales naturally fall to historic lows.\u201d More homes are being listed in 2025 than the past two years The rate of homes being listed for sale in the first nine months of the year rose a little to 3.9%\u2014meaning 39 out of every 1,000 homes were listed for sale. It was the third-slowest rate of homes being listed in records going back to 2012, just a fraction higher than last year\u2019s 3.7% and 2023\u2019s record low of 3.5%. This year\u2019s rate is down 25.2% from before the pandemic in 2019 (52 listings per 1,000 homes) and 24.3% down from 2021 (51 listings per 1,000 homes). Sales of condos/townhouses down more than 3% from a year ago Around 30 out of every 1,000 single family homes sold in the first nine months of this year, a slightly faster clip than the roughly 22 out of every 1,000 condos/townhouses that sold. The sales turnover rate for condos/townhouses fell 3.3% year over year, while the rate for single family homes ticked up 0.6%. That\u2019s in line with Redfin data showing how hard it is to sell condos this year, with an estimated 72.3% more condo sellers than buyers nationwide in August. Around 33 out of every 1,000 condos/townhouses listed for sale in the first nine months of the year, while around 41 out of every 1,000 single family homes were listed for sale. Homes turning over the most in Virginia Beach and West Palm Beach Virginia Beach, VA topped the list of 50 most populous U.S. metros with the highest turnover rate, with around 35 out of every 1,000 homes sold in the first nine months of the year. The next metros with the highest turnover rate this year were West Palm Beach, FL (32.6 sales per 1,000 homes), Tampa, FL (31.2 sales per 1,000 homes), Indianapolis (30.3 sales per 1,000 homes) and Atlanta (30.1 sales per 1,000 homes). Demand in the Sun Belt has softened significantly since the peak of the pandemic and the sales rate is continuing to drop fast in many of the region\u2019s metro areas. San Antonio\u2019s turnover rate fell to 24 sales per 1,000 homes, down -26.9% from a year ago and the biggest decline among the top 50 metro areas. Next came Charlotte, NC (-19.9%), Jacksonville, FL (-17.3%), Miami (-16.7%) and Orlando, FL (-16.1%). The only three major metros to post a faster turnover rate from a year ago were Virginia Beach, VA (+5.3%), San Francisco (+2.6%) and Indianapolis (+1.4%) Homes turning over the least in New York and Californian metros New York recorded the lowest turnover rate among the top 50 metros, with only around 10 out of every 1,000 homes selling in the first nine months of the year. Next came six California metros, led by Los Angeles (11.5 sales per 1,000 homes), San Francisco (13.2 sales per 1,000 homes) and San Jose, CA (14.8 sales per 1,000 homes). California\u2019s low housing turnover stems in part from Proposition 13, a state law that restricts property-tax growth and creates a strong financial incentive for homeowners to remain in their homes. It\u2019s worth noting that the increased SALT cap rate may help to unlock some of California\u2019s housing inventory in future years.",

        "score": 20,
        "text_content": "From the very beginning of human civilization, the existence of machines, even the most basic ones like a wheeled cart, has changed life drastically for the people of that time. But there have always been two sides to it. Some believed machines made life easier, while others believed they would no longer be needed to do the work that the machine could do. Think about it. When factories that automated the making of essential goods first came into existence, fewer people were needed to keep them running, and that caused a lot of anger because people lost their jobs. But if I were to ask you today whether you would rather those factories never existed, would you say yes? Of course not. Because without them, we wouldn\u2019t have come this far. Technology would look completely different. But if someone from that time period were asked the same question, they would probably fight you, because they were the ones who lost their jobs. One thing to notice is that every time we have seen a major advancement in technology, some people have lost their jobs or what could have been their jobs. For example, I am an old school artist. I like to sketch on paper. I cannot for the life of me use the software people use to create digital art. So even though my art has always been a hobby, I could never really make any profit from it because most people prefer digital art unless the paper/canvass drawings are exceptionally good. This is not a rant, it is just my way of explaining how some people are bound to dislike tech because it takes away something from them, something they believe they are good at and makes them who they are and then a new technology comes along, and whatever you do becomes easier or more accessible, and you feel like you have lost what made you special. Some people adapt to change. They try to be better in ways the new technology is not. When computers were new, there were people who specialized in certain programming languages. But then new ones were introduced, and support for some of the old ones disappeared. Some people hated the change, while others learned and got good at what was new. They adapted. With the rise of AI, we see something very similar. People dislike AI because, like all new technologies, it is taking away their jobs. It makes people feel powerless. Imagine thinking you are a great artist, proud of your skills, and then one day finding out someone can wake up and use AI to create the same art you do (without even your damn permission). It would feel like fuxking shit, and yes even in the past technology has taken inspiration, or just straight up stolen things from others to advance, well, not technology, but people who made it (you get what I mean). The hate for AI is also made worse by movies showing AI taking over the world, games about machines wanting to \"be human\", and misinformation spread by the media. One day I literally had to argue with someone who read somewhere that a new OpenAI model KILLED an admin. What??????????? :/ I know this might sound obvious, but I am writing this because I have talked to many people who hate AI and refuse to admit it is because of fear. P.s Thank you if you chose to waste your time reading this. And no, I did not use AI. This would probably be better written if I did, and yes, I suck at writing.",

The conveyor belt had been specifically designed for the purpose it fulfilled gracefully, whereas tons of startups are trying to find a problem to solve with LLMs and don\u2019t understand the sophisticated toolset that engineers bring to the table for such a solution.

        "score": 37,
        "text_content": "There has been **a lot** of misinformation regarding the recent restructuring and other big announcements from the past 72 hours. No they did not turn a non-profit into a for-profit. No they did not change the definition of AGI to \u201cwhen an AI makes $100B\u201d. no, there isn\u2019t any evidence of Sama getting equity in this restructure, and no the OpenAI non-profit did not previously own 100% of the OpenAI Global LLC(the for-profit/capped-profit arm that made chatGPT and all the main models). And no, I did not use AI to write any of this post. Here are the main facts that we know, summarized: - OpenAI has had a main LLC(the organization doing the main research progress and product creation) and a non-profit, for several years now, but has now converted their LLC to a PBC(public benefit company) which now has the legal obligation of ensuring AGI \u201cbenefits all of humanity\u201d, just as the non-profit does. - The LLC had a profit cap of 100X per investor where-as the current PBC has no such cap. - The ownership of the PBC is split amongst the following: Microsoft owns 27%, The OpenAI non-profit owns 26%, OpenAI employees own 26%, and other investors/shareholders own the remaining 21%. - The non-profit is now worth $130B(It had no valuation prior, atleast not publicly) and is starting out with making an initial spending commitment of $26B towards: health, curing disease, and AI resilience (all of the things that could help society have a successful transition to a post-AGI world, including technical safety but also things like economic impact, cyber security, and much more) - Once AGI is declared by OpenAI, that declaration will now be verified by an independent expert panel. Their charter definition of AGI is still unchanged from: \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\" - Microsoft\u2019s IP rights to research, defined as the confidential methods used in the development of models and systems, will remain until either the expert panel verifies AGI or through 2030, whichever is first. - Microsoft\u2019s IP rights for both models and products (excluding hardware products) are extended through 2032 and now includes models post-AGI, with appropriate safety guardrails. Extra details about safety and who controls what: - The non-profit board-level safety and security committee will have the power and authority to require mitigation measures\u2014up to and including halting the release of models or AI systems\u2014even where the applicable risk thresholds would otherwise permit release. - PBC directors will be required to consider only the mission (and may not consider the pecuniary(financial) interests of stockholders or any other interest) with respect to safety and security issues related to the OpenAI enterprise and its technology. - Within one year of the recapitalization, the non-profit board will have at least two directors (including the Chair of the Safety and Security Committee) who will not serve on the PBC Board. Extra details about long term roadmap: - OpenAI has announced their research plans of having automated AI research interns running on hundreds of thousands of GPUs by September 2026, and having fully automated AI researchers by March 2028. - OpenAI now has committed plans of about 30GW of compute totaling $1.4 Trillion over the next few years(this could be over 5 years, 10 years or more, it\u2019s not specified), with a long term goal of eventually building an \u201cAI factory\u201d that can produce 1GW per week (52GW per year) Sources: All of my information above is derived from a combination of direct public data from government sources like Delaware.gov, as well as direct public data from OpenAI themselves: Delaware.gov official restructuring commitments for OpenAI, October 28th: https://news.delaware.gov/2025/10/28/ag-jennings-completes-review-of OpenAI official info on their new company structure: https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/ and their new arrangement with Microsoft: https://openai.com/index/next-chapter-of-microsoft-openai-partnership/ OpenAI official info about their previous company structure: http://openai.com/our-structure/",

        "text_content": "**Preface:** I wrote the following post 7 days ago but it got automatically removed. I contacted the mods, after days of back-and-forth they said 'they believe it was removed because of the twitter link'. I decided to repost it due to recent [AMD 9800X3D 'failures/deaths' Reddit megathread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1ix9p8c/amd_9800x3d_failuresdeaths_reddit_megathread/) post. People in this sub I believe have the same sentiment. I hope this won't get auto removed again. --- It is my observation that articles originating from Tom's Hardware are becoming more and more unreliable as time passes. Some of those articles (if not most) are based on unconfirmed rumors, originating from short tweets. They write articles out of those without adding anything substantial. They convert the source into paragraph long article by adding filler words. Those articles fail to satisfy some of the standards of r/Hardware; and they fail to comply with some of the rules of this sub. By being a known website of many years, they produce a lot of content and quickly. By the extension of it r/Hardware gets filled with content from Tom's Hardware at a similar rate. This has the potential to manipulate conversations based on unreliable articles. Therefore, as a whole, articles from Tom's Hardware should be banned. # r/Hardware's Standards It writes in bold on the sidebar on of r/hardware on Old Reddit that: > **The goal of /r/hardware is a place for quality hardware news, reviews, and intelligent discussion.** \"**Quality**\" is the adjective used here for news and reviews. Tom's Hardware in my opinion do not publish quality news. ## Some Rules Here are related rules of this subreddit. > ### Original Source Policy > Content submitted should be of original source, or at least contain partially original reporting on top of existing information. Exceptions can be made for content in foreign language or any other exceptional cases. Fully paywalled articles are not allowed. Please contact the moderators through modmail if you have questions. > ### Rumor Policy > No unsubstantiated rumors - Rumors or other claims/information not directly from official sources must have evidence to support them. Any rumor or claim that is just a statement from an unknown source containing no supporting evidence will be removed. \"Content submitted should be of original source, or at least contain partially original reporting on top of existing information.\" says one rules Therefore shared articles must at the very least (1) contain the source information and (2) additional reporting on top of that. \"Rumors or other claims/information (...) must have evidence to support them.\" says another rule. This on is self-explanatory. # An example Recently [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1iriore/rtx_5090_supplies_to_be_stupidly_high_next_month/) linking to [this article by Hassam Nasir](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/rtx-5090-supplies-to-be-stupidly-high-next-month-as-gb200-wafers-get-repurposed-asserts-leaker) is posted on this sub. It is flaired as Rumor. Title of the post is the same as the title of the article: > RTX 5090 supplies to be 'stupidly high' next month as GB200 wafers get repurposed, asserts leaker This article's title's has a definitive statement. Yet the article has nothing definitive. It alleges, supposes; and finishes with adding nothing substantial. It doesn't proves or disproves the claims of the source. By the way, the source to this 2460 character long article is this short tweet: > The supply of RTX5090 will be stupidly high soon. Scalpers will cry so hard\ud83d\ude02 > by @Zed__Wang on Twitter. > Link: x(dot)com/Zed__Wang/status/1890608126329586017 This article is not a quality article. It doesn't contain the source information in full, it only mentions it and provides a link. It does add some text on top of that **but that is not additional reporting**. It is also an unsubstantiated rumor. This post is currently 5 hours old and is on the top of r/Hardware (in default 'Hot' view). It got 171 comments. It creates engagement, rightfully so with regard to what it says on the title. In reality, there is no substance. I can report this singular post, but there is an infestation. And as a community, we should demand higher quality standards for this sub from the moderators. We deserve it. --- I am not an active Redditor on this sub, but I frequently visit here, read people's opinions.",

Claude 3.5 was failing at one of the objectives I had, as was o3-mini-high. I was going back and forth between the two trying to get it to work and it was just falling apart in the process. I got it to work with a single prompt in Claude 3.7. I\u2019ve been building it out a bit since then, but the core functionality that I just could not get to work before today just popped out like some sort miracle. Also, this is personal taste, but I just like its personality more than o3-mini-high. I always feel like o3 wants me to do all the work and is annoyed by prompts.",

Not only is Sonnet 3.7 significantly better at coding, but Claude Code addresses most of the major pain points related to using LLMs while coding (understanding codebase context, quickly making changes, focusing on key snippets rather than writing entire files.. etc.). Basically, the entire coding process just got a whole lot easier, a whole lot faster, and a lot more accessible. Anthropic already says that 45 minute manual work is now being done in seconds and minutes. Now, scale those time savings to almost every software developer in the world.. This has serious implications for the development of software, and the development of AI, and today we are witnessing a serious acceleration of technological development, and I think that is awesome.",

This is pretty much confirmed by OpenAI themselves, as well as common sense. The GPT-4o they could have made o1 and o3 on is probably the 0806 version since the newer ones are too new. So, the jump between GPT-4o and o1 is **20.34 points** on LiveBench, which is INSANE. For reference, the jump between DeepSeek-V3 (the base model R1 uses) and R1 is only **11.12 points**; the jump between Claude 3.7 Sonnet and the reasoning version is only **10.54 points**; and the difference between Gemini 2 Flash and the reasoning version is only **5.45 points**. We can clearly see that the differences in performance between base models and reasoning models vary widely between different companies. Google's implementation only gets them +5 points, whereas DeepSeek and Anthropic both get roughly +10 points, and OpenAI is getting over +20 points with just o1. Full o3, which is also based on 4o, isn't even on LiveBench yet, but it's safe to assume it would be pushing the mid-80s at least. That's like +30 points on LiveBench over GPT-4o just from OpenAI's reasoning framework applied to a shitty model like GPT-4o (I'm not an OpenAI fan either\u2014I see this as pretty obvious truths). GPT-4.5 is coming out very soon, and they will probably make the next o-model/GPT model (since they're fused now) with GPT-4.5 as the base model. If it gets even close to the same gains as o3 does, then that would put them thoroughly ahead. Now, the only possible flaw in this logic is assuming o1 and o3 are based on GPT-4o since OpenAI *technicallllllly* never confirmed this explicitly by saying outright, \"Ya, o3 is based on GPT-4o.\" But the overwhelming evidence suggests this, including official OpenAI statements. For example, they called o1 \"GPT-4o with reasoning,\" and they did explicitly say o3 was just o1 with further RL applied and wasn't actually a different model. They also have the same tokenizers, knowledge cutoffs, and token limits. Also, it just wouldn't make any sense for them not to release the base model they made o1 with, and we know it can't have used GPT-4.5 since o1 dates back to way before September last year, and 4.5 was definitely not finished all the way back then.",

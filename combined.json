        "text_content": "Don't get me wrong, I also don't like the fact that the full games are not on the card. That sucks. It takes up storage on my system and I basically get a paperweight of a cartridge. I also hate the stupid banner on the cases, because I like me a nice looking physical case. But people are pretending this is some scummy thing that ***only*** Nintendo is doing, and even refusing to buy the games, not even digitally, if they use a keycard for their physical release. This is happening when many, if not most PS5 and Xbox physical games need to get downloaded and installed into the console in order to play them. which is basically the same thing. Many PS5 and Xbox games are not fully included on the discs, just like game keycards. Only difference is that PS5 and Xbox dont have a quirky name for it and a stupid banner on the cases. Hell, i'm sure that this whole shitstorm would not have started if Nintendo didn't give it a quirky name, and just added a small \"Download required\" line into the boxes. There's also the issue of the downloads possibly being taken down in the future.. But think about it. The download servers for the Wii Shop, and the 3DS and Wii U eShop are still up even after all this time. If you bought digital games back then, you can still redownload them. Heck, even update servers are still up, i'm still able to software update my Wii U and 3DS games. Even after all the online play services were taken down. If Nintendo wanted to shut down the download servers for the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS, they would have done so already. So *Nintendo not letting you download a game you own* ***is a valid concern***\\*, but not a\\* ***proven*** *an issue here.* Nintendo has not pulled an Ubisoft and said that \"we don't own our digital games.\" so far, they've been pretty good with them. Sure, the downloads can be taken down, and it's a very valid concern, but i think that would be in at the very least 20 years. The Wii's servers have been going on for 19 years already after all. I'm just saying, if you are gonna refuse to buy games and boycott Nintendo over a download being required for your game, then also do the same for Xbox, Playstation, and Steam. Again, I still don't like game key cards, I would prefer if my whole game was on the cartridge, **You SHOULD give Nintendo flack for a bad practice, that's important and valid. Don't let companies get away with BS practices.** I'm still choosing to not support game key cards, and will go out of my way to just buy the games digitally. But don't make something like this the end of gaming or the end of preservation. ***And specially don't make this the only reason you don't buy a game you actually wanna play.*** Edit: This is not saying \"Everybody is doing it, so its not so bad\". This is saying \"If you are making a fuss about Nintendo doing it, also equally fuss about it with the other platforms. But don't make it the end of the world\" Thank you for listening to my ted talk, hope I don't get cooked.",

Yes, I'm concerned about how it can be abused (e.g. Grok Companions slowly influencing users toward political extremism, corporate data collection of highly intimate information, atrophy of communication skills, etc.), I don't brush this off like some, but I view such concerns as [challenges to overcome, rather than obstacles to be avoided](http://www.chakoteya.net/NextGen/270.htm). Also I'm absurdly picky, hence why I don't find current AI satisfying for this. [This is my goal](https://youtu.be/TDxOUD7AgJk), minus the whole defying us thing.",

I bought TEAMGROUP's X1 Max flash drive. It's an M.2 drive on a board with USB-A and USB-C connectors on either end. I had this for around 90 days when this happened: I reached down to the front of my desktop to pull the memory stick out...and the plastic case slid off the circuit board. Apparently the glue or heat weld that bonds the plastic case to the black connector failed. This is where it gets crazy: I figured this would be a very quick resolution for what was obviously a product failure under warranty. But what actually happened is that TEAMGROUP told me, \"Once physical damage occurs, such as cosmetic damage or case removal, it is considered outside the scope of warranty coverage.\" I was confused at first, and thought I hadn't properly explained that **the case came off in my hand in the course of regular / intended use**. [https://imgur.com/a/m7dGTet](https://imgur.com/a/m7dGTet) But no; after 2 more e-mails they made their position clear. **Because I had \"removed\" the case, I had damaged the drive. \ud83d\ude36** They claimed that all of their products go through \"extensive testing\" and therefore if the drive failed, it must have been misuse.

The printer was new, the box was factory sealed, never even loaded with ink, 100% new. They said the printer was missing a cable, hard plastics, the connector to the main board (where the missing cable was supposed to be) was broken and solder joints were broken.

You're losing functionality on the motherboard to make room for voltage conversion, which would disproportionately affect small form factor boards in a big way. There's no real increase in efficiency, either, because whether you have wires going from the PSU to a peripheral or from the motherboard to a peripheral, it's still wires running at the lower voltage that peripheral requires. You could make an argument for 5V USB power, or 3.3V PCIe slots, but it wouldn't be a very good one. It's also a cost shift. If you have the voltage conversion done on the PSU, which you can pass from PC to PC over many years (still on the same 1200W unit I bought in 2012), you're paying once every ~10 years for that functionality. If you force that to be on the motherboard, you're paying for it every time you replace that board to upgrade the CPU to a new socket. Basically, the standard hasn't made any headway into DIY, because it's a terrible idea that provides no benefits in that space.",

A near-idling Threadripper virtual machine host spends 2% of its time in P0 and 98% in C, and uses lots of power. If I forbid P0, it will spend 2% of its time in P1 and 98% in C, and use one-fourth of the power - at obviously no cost to performance because it's idling anyway. If *that* could happen automatically, imagine the power saving across the board... And by \"that\" I mean every wake-up from C-state should go to P1 first, and then be upgraded to P0 if it lasts long enough. What happens now is that every tiny interrupt goes to P0, and the CPU immediately goes to Precision Boost mode, ramping up voltages and clocks to maximum (especially since power budgets are overflowing) - only to go back to C0 a microsecond later. And since there is only one voltage shared between all cores, any single core's P0 makes *all* cores enjoy the high voltage, even if they are themselves sleeping. I suppose that's where most of the waste goes.",

In a [social media post](https://x.com/markzandi/status/1967277820045865206?s=46&t=_56klavkvTXRR4AVuBlNpQ) on Sunday, he noted that Moody\u2019s own leading economic indicator that uses machine learning has estimated the odds of a recession in the next 12 months are now at 48%. Even though it\u2019s less than 50%, Zandi pointed out that the probability has never been that high previously without the economy eventually slipping into a downturn. A crucial component in the Moody\u2019s indicator comes from the housing market. \u201cThe algorithm has identified building permits as the most critical economic variable for predicting recessions. And while permits had been holding up reasonably well, as builders supported sales through interest rate buydowns and other incentives, inventories of unsold homes are now high and on the rise,\u201d Zandi warned. \u201cIn response, builders are pulling back, and permits have started to slump. They are now as low as they\u2019ve been since the pandemic shutdowns.\u201d Last month, the Census Bureau reported that residential building permits in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million, down 2.8% from the prior month and down 5.7% from a year ago. In July, Zandi singled out the housing market for concern, escalating it to a \u201cred flare\u201d as home sales, homebuilding, and house prices were getting squeezed by elevated mortgage rates. While the 30-year fixed rate has since come down from near 7% to about 6.3%, it\u2019s not clear yet if that\u2019s low enough to revive builders or how much it will continue to drop. On Sunday, Zandi said all eyes should be on August permit data, which will come out on Wednesday. \u201cThey are sure to provide another reason why the Fed should and will announce a rate cut later that day,\u201d he predicted. In fact, Federal Reserve policymakers have already started worrying about the housing market. Minutes from the central bank\u2019s July meeting revealed concerns about weak housing demand, rising supply, and falling home prices. And not only did housing show up on the Fed\u2019s radar, officials flagged it as a potential risk to jobs, along with artificial intelligence technology. \u201cIn addition to tariff-induced risks, potential downside risks to employment mentioned by participants included a possible tightening of financial conditions due to a rise in risk premiums, a more substantial deterioration in the housing market, and the risk that the increased use of AI in the workplace may lower employment,\u201d the minutes said. Permits aren\u2019t the only housing market data point to follow. The economist Ed Leamer, who passed away in February, famously published a paper in 2007 that said residential investment is the best leading indicator of an oncoming recession. On that score, the data doesn\u2019t look good either. In the second quarter, residential investment tumbled 4.7%, accelerating from the first quarter\u2019s 1.3% decline.",

Higher rates are mostly useful for keeping speculators out of the market, but list prices today would still be unaffordable for workers today even with 2% mortgage rates. The big factors for affordability are \\* US workers' wages, which have been and will remain permanently pressured downwards due to globalization. Americans are simultaneously far poorer than they were 30-40 years ago, and still the richest and most expensive workers in the world. There was just that much meat on the bone in the latter 20th century. \\*and ultimately, M0 money supply. Because in the end, the Fed can inflate this sucker as much as they want.

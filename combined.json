Maglev fans can only achieve that extended lifetime if they're running continuously, or at least don't stop and start very often. That's because they only \"fly\" when they're running above a certain speed, and they can wear worse than a sleeve bearing fan when they're not flying.

Excellent noise/performance can be achieved with normal bearings when you scale cost into higher quality productuon and R&D. The result is noctua fans. The best noctua fans from what I've read online seem to outperform any ML fans at similar (high) costs per fan. Maglev does not automatically mean better performance than bearings. Developing a different technology might not be worth the cost when the benefits are undetermined in terms of the output cost/performance product.",

I remember seeing their AM5 boards being sold on NE by Sapphire directly...so I hope these follow suit. Also, the X870 board was announced but not shown...so hopefully that one will see light outside of the East? I hope so! Be nice to pair my Nitro+9070XT with a X870 Nitro+ board. Sapphire has been as close as the \"EVGA\" side of AMD for quite awhile. I've only ever used their cards with zero complaints. Quality build and materials, and the few times I've contacted their customer support for an extra fan it's always been easy to get em shipped (for no charge either, which is nice.)",

                "raw_content": "The number of Redfin.com users based in Canada searching for U.S. homes to rent or buy fell 26.4% from a year earlier in May. That\u2019s a sign that fewer Canadians are moving south of the border or seeking vacation homes in once-popular destinations like Miami and Phoenix. Fewer Canadians are searching for homes in the United States than they were at the start of 2025, before the U.S. instituted steep tariffs on Canada and relations between the two countries started suffering. The number of Canadian Redfin.com users searching for homes in the U.S. on Redfin.com dropped 26.4% year over year in May. For comparison, the total number of prospective buyers and renters searching on Redfin.com declined, too, but by a fraction of the amount. Canadians searching for homes in U.S. destinations started declining significantly in February, when the White House implemented 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. The drop was especially steep in April, the month the Trump administration announced its vast global tariff policy, falling 34.2% year over year. This is according to an analysis of the number of Redfin.com users based in Canada searching for homes for sale and for rent in the United States. The data is based on unique users, i.e. the number of different people who access U.S. home listings on Redfin.com or the Redfin app within a defined period; that user is counted only once for the period. The decline in Canada-based searches for U.S. homes coincides with some Canadians growing disillusioned with the United States. Shortly after President Trump took office in January, he instituted high tariffs on goods from Canada, and made comments about making Canada the \u201c51st state.\u201d In addition to trade concerns, the Canadian dollar has been relatively weak this spring, making it harder for Canadians to afford already-expensive U.S. real estate. \u201cNormally I work with about five Canadian buyers each spring, mostly older folks looking for a second home. This year, there were none,\u201d said Heather Mahmood-Corley, a Redfin Premier agent in Phoenix. \u201cI actually helped a Canadian sell their Phoenix home earlier this year. People from Canada are retreating from owning real estate in the U.S. because of political tensions; some of them are worried it will no longer be practical to travel back and forth between the two countries, and some don\u2019t want their money tied up in the U.S. But also, we\u2019re not seeing as many snowbird buyers in general; I\u2019ve noticed older people are more concerned about their stock portfolios and 401Ks as the economy fluctuates.\u201d Historically, Canadians have made up the largest portion of international homebuyers in the U.S. In 2024, for instance, Canadians made up 13% of foreign buyers, snapping up $5.9 billion worth of U.S. real estate. Fewer Canadians Are Searching For Homes in Nearly Every Major U.S. Metro Area On a metro level, fewer Canadians are searching for homes in all but two of the 50 largest U.S. metros. The biggest declines in Canadians looking for U.S. homes are in big cities: Canadians searching in Houston dropped 55.2% year over year in May, and dropped 53% in Philadelphia and 47% in Chicago. Significantly fewer Canadians are searching in warm places that typically attract a lot of Canada-based second-home buyers. The number of Canadians searching for homes in both Miami and Orlando declined by about 30% year over year in May. Canada-to-Phoenix and Canada-to-Riverside (Palm Springs), CA both declined by about 23%. \u201cI haven\u2019t worked with a Canadian buyer in at least a year,\u201d said Marsha McMahon-Jones, a Redfin Premier agent in Palm Springs. \u201cI\u2019m in touch with a few potential buyers, but they\u2019re staying put in Canada for now with the idea of potentially making a move if and when Canada-U.S. relations improve. I haven\u2019t heard of any Canadians who already live here part of the year listing their Palm Springs home, though.\u201d Those second-home destinations followed a similar pattern as Canada-to-U.S. Redfin.com users overall, with sharp dips in April and slightly smaller but still significant dips in May. It\u2019s worth noting that the housing market in Florida, a popular destination for Canadian buyers, has cooled for American and foreign buyers alike. Fewer people are interested in buying homes in Florida\u2013particularly coastal parts of the state\u2013as insurance costs soar and climate disasters intensify. Housing markets in Phoenix and Riverside have also cooled, though to a lesser extent.",

Unfortunately this causes serious lighting instability. # Mirror-like reflections like with ray reconstruction Curiously disabling the denoiser in Silent Hill 2 and some other games resulted in very stable and crisp reflections. It even resolves textures a lot better which helps boost texture quality. The difference compared to Preset K with denoiser enabled is massive and Preset L looked like Ray Reconstruction was enabled. Take a look at the transitions at 7:20, 7:58, 8:15, 8:29, 8:39, 8:45, and 8:51 in DF's preset L video. From a blurry unstable mess to crisp and very stable, which is basically what you would expect from Ray Reconstruction.

As you can see preset L denoises PT (experimental) in Dragon's Dogma 2 a lot better that Preset K (old transformer): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0qyNCVMUNg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0qyNCVMUNg) In motion the difference grows: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mMGzJpCvNw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mMGzJpCvNw) # Wrapping up With such a limited sample size in and it's hard to draw any conclusions and more games need to be tested. Deep dives from DF, Hardware Unboxed and more side by side YT uploads is definitely warranted. I've also seen many people here and in the NVIDIA subreddit claim that the upscaler's denoising is either broken in some games or impossible to test because denoisers can't be easily disabled. Unfortunately as of now the updated super resolution models are incompatible with NRD and other built-in RT denoisers. This defeats the original purpose of DLSS: negating the performance loss of using ray tracing. It's a real shame that NVIDIA couldn't or didn't fix the denoiser issue with Preset L and M yet. **Note to mod:** I've deleted the original low effort Videocardz articl post and decided to incorporate the info from comment section + additional info here instead.",

It did look like bright lights were very close between them though, while J/K gave slightly dimmer lighting, at least in the 1 game I've checked, but I wonder if that's related to the HDR changes that NV mentioned.

        "text_content": "# 2026: * **Project League**: A co-op Assassin's Creed game, originally conceived as a DLC for AC Shadows. * **Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake**: In development since 2020, and cancelled after rebooting development. It was really close to getting released. * **Three unannounced titles (New IPs) and a mobile game** # 2025: * **Star Wars Outlaws 2**: Cancelled very early in development, according to Tom Henderson. Possibly scrapped due to poor sales. * **Project Maverick (original version):** Extraction-Based spin-off of Far Cry, initially intended to be the multiplayer component of FC7. Development was rebooted in early 2025, and some resources shifted towards FC7. # 2024: * **Project Pathfinder (original version of Project U)**: Announced in 2022 as a \u201cnew kind of session-based cooperative shooter\u201d. Development was rebooted in 2024, after the success of Helldivers 2. * **Project Scarlet**: Assassin's Creed game set during the post-American Civil War period. Cancelled for being deemed \"too political\" for the current climate in the US. * **The Division: Heartland:** A free-to-play, PvEvP extraction-survival shooter. Cancelled to prioritize \"bigger\" projects like XDefiant (lol) and the Rainbow Six franchise. # 2023: * **Project Oxygen (Immortals Fenyx Rising 2):** In development at Ubisoft Quebec and set in a fictionalized Polynesian archipelago. Cancelled to prioritize more established IPs. * **Project Q**: A stylized 3rd-person PVPVE game made in Unreal Engine 5. Cancelled to shift priority to other projects. * **Project Renaissance**: A Minecraft-type voxel game where you could create different worlds. After its cancellation between February and May 2023, it turned into another game internally named **Project Alterra**. # 2022: * **Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Frontline:** A free-to-play, first-person shooter. Developed by Ubisoft Bucharest and announced in 2021. Cancelled due to bad reception. * **Splinter Cell VR**: Announced to be in development by Ubisoft Redstorm in 2020 and eventually cancelled due to the results of cost reduction. * **Two unannounced titles.** # 2021: * **The Story of Rayman/Rayman Forever:** A remake of the original Rayman with the working titles \"Rayman: Forever\" and \"The Story of Rayman\". It was scrapped in 2021, according to a former Ubisoft VFX artist. * **Project Reaper (original version of TD Heartland)**: A standalone battle royale of The Division that was shelved in 2021 due to poor player feedback. It restarted development in 2022, due to Hyper Scape shutting down, and became Heartland, which also got cancelled. # 2019: * **Project Pioneer:** A sci-fi game with non-violent exploration that started development around 2013 and was teased inside Watch Dogs 2. According to Kotaku, it got rebooted into a co-op multiplayer alien shooter. * **Project Avalon**: A medieval fantasy RPG with elements of magic and swordplay, loosely based on King Arthur. Dragon Age creative director Mike Laidlaw was directing the project. * **Sequel to Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame:** A 2D sequel to the 1993 game, developed by Ubisoft Montpellier. It was cancelled in 2019, according to Jordan Mechner. # 2018: * **Project Falcon (original version of XDefiant):** A monster-hunting game that Ubisoft San Francisco was developing. It ended up being reworked and became XDefiant. * **Project Ion:** Another sci-fi title that was being developed by Ubisoft Redstorm. There's not much information surrounding this project, so it might just be an earlier iteration of **Pioneer**.",

        "text_content": "[Original reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResidentEvilRequiem/comments/1qxk180/new_re9_requiem_spoilers_from_chinese_insider/) The info was posted on [Bilibili](https://m.bilibili.com/opus/1162383674075774983) and [Tieba](https://tieba.baidu.com/p/10465590677?fr=frs#/) Credit to u/Cautious-Ad4556 Note: the spoilers have been translated with Gemini3 SPOILERS **The Story**: RE9 focuses on the story of two individuals cursed by Umbrella. Someone is secretly helping Grace,this person is confirmed to be neither Leon nor Victor. \"Time\" is a crucial element that runs through the entire game. **Some Dialogue Lines** \"You probably want to know if there's a cure for your condition, Mr. Kennedy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to know when the last time you brushed your teeth was.\u201d **About Leon's Infection** Victor refers to these side effects as \"Umbrella's gift\" The infection visible on Leon's neck does not originate from this game, nor is it a new virus. The strange black growths are described in a conversation with Victor as symptoms that gradually appear in many Raccoon City survivors over time. The \"team\" supporting Leon in this game may \"include\" other survivors of the Raccoon City incident. (Note: The leaker hints that they might not necessarily appear physically). A fourth Raccoon City survivor died in a government office, though specific details were not given. **The Final Boss** Victor is NOT the final boss. The final boss is unexpected; he/she only spoke a single line in the trailers. Most people's first impression of Victor is largely correct, but \"Victor is just Victor\"\u2014he hasn't changed his name, nor has he been possessed/body-snatched.(Note:AI translate trash here,look the hint below) **About Victor** The hooded man who killed Alyssa is Victor, even if they don't look alike. Victor's skin condition is related to Wrenwood Hotel event. Victor is extremely calculating; he can even directly access information regarding DSO government agents. Victor and Leon are influenced by the same thing. This is different from the infection affecting the zombies at the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center. Rather describe Victor as a villain, rather than described him as \"another pitiful soul\" or a \"teacher.\" To Grace, he is like Hannibal Lecter to Clarice Starling.(Note:maybe this is about Silence of the Lambs) To Leon, he is like a fellow patient suffering from the same torture. **About Leon** Don't be fooled by how invincible Leon looks in the trailers; he is going to struggle significantly. Victor is very tall and physically strong, similar to Mendez in RE4. Leon undergoes both physiological and psychological torture. The leaker used the word \"Exhausted\" to summarize his state. You will see a clear shift in Leon's mentality. Regarding complaints about Leon's slow reaction to the nurse's death in the demo: The leaker states this isn't the only person he fails to save. There will be similar sequences. In the late game, Leon receives support from his \"team,\" primarily in the form of equipment/gear. Regarding the new dialogue from yesterday's Switch presentation: Leon mentions six Raccoon City survivors who died from the same thing. Their \"curse\" is the same as Leon and Victor's. These six deceased survivors do not include Alyssa. **About Grace** Grace has a gameplay system related to her identity as an FBI Analyst. In the late game, this system can even determine the order in which you explore certain areas. There are numerous documents/files that require Grace's gameplay system to analyze and read. **Other Characters** the woman who contact with Leon in trailer is Sherry.(Note:leaker post a emoji which means \"\u96ea\u68a8\"\uff0c\u96ea\u68a8 Xueli\uff0ca chinese word pronounced similarly to Sherry) **Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center** Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center is filled with high-contrast dark humor. Victor used a specific method to shoot down the helicopter coming to rescue Leon (Note: Likely the new scene shown in yesterday's Switch presentation). The location features a mix of classical architecture and construction sites. There is a sequence similar to Water Hall in RE4 (Note:confirmed by last night Switch Presentation, leaker post this a few days ago ). **Raccoon City Chapter** in trailer Leon drives Grace to Raccoon City. This is done in defiance of the orders from the organization that sent him. They are racing against time. Dialogue between Leon and Grace is sparse in the early game but increases significantly during the drive to Raccoon City and afterwards. **The reason for going to Raccoon City**: \"Something\" went to Raccoon City. **Implied Information** The leaker \"liked\" some comments asking him more about RE9 Leon is alive in the ending. There is someone secretly helping Grace. The leaker \"liked\" a comment asking if Ada would appear in RE9, hinting that Ada might be involved (though potentially not in a physical capacity). The final boss might be Spencer. Take the info with a grain of salt",

As both mortgage rates and home prices remained elevated far above pandemic levels, many lost hope in the American dream of homeownership, and younger generations gave up on the idea altogether. But the CEO of Rocket Companies, whose flagship subsidiary is Rocket Mortgage, said this week there are signs Americans are moving off the sidelines and vying for homeownership. Coming at the heels of mortgage rates dropping just slightly below 6%, Rocket CEO Varun Krishna told CNBC the company is poised to have the highest mortgage loan production volume and highest gain on sale in four years. Rocket\u2019s current success differs vastly from what\u2019s happening in the mortgage industry more broadly. While the Detroit-based lender rides a wave of renewed demand, PennyMac, a major U.S. mortgage lender and servicer, faces a slower and more painful reset.

                "raw_content": "Persistently low homeowner and rental vacancy rates indicate that the U.S. housing market remains structurally undersupplied. Comparing 2024 abnormally low vacancy rates with long-run equilibrium levels across U.S. metropolitan markets, NAHB estimates that approximately 1.2 million additional housing units are required to close the gap and restore vacancy rates to historical norms. This figure represents NAHB\u2019s updated estimate of the structural housing deficit, defined as the cumulative amount of above-equilibrium construction needed to rebalance the market. NAHB\u2019s baseline forecast suggests this adjustment could occur between 2026 and 2030, contingent on sustained home building activity. Homeowner and rental vacancy rates are key indicators of housing market tightness and future price dynamics. In 2022, U.S. rental vacancy rates fell to 5.1%, the lowest level in decades, underscoring the severity of the post-pandemic housing shortage. By comparison, rental vacancy rates have averaged 6.6% since 2005, when the American Community Survey (ACS) began reporting these data. A surge in multifamily construction in 2024 led to improved rental availability across many metropolitan areas, with the national vacancy rate rising to 5.7% but remaining below the historic norm. In contrast, single-family construction remains significantly constrained by structural barriers, including restrictive zoning regulations, limited land availability, and persistent labor shortages. As a result, owner vacancy rates continued to decline through 2023, reaching a record low of 0.8%, the lowest level observed in the ACS series. While showing a modest improvement in 2024, owner vacancy rates remain below 1%, compared with the post-2005 average of 1.8%, indicating that for-sale housing shortages persist nationally. ACS data provide a granular view of vacancy rates across metropolitan areas and allow geographic identification of structural imbalances. The \u201clong run\u201d average vacancy rates can serve as a proxy for normal, or natural, vacancy rates. There are numerous reasons why normal vacancy rates may differ across metropolitan areas. For example, areas with mobile labor markets and higher population turnover will consistently experience higher vacancy rates. Vacation destination housing markets also naturally have higher vacancy rates, reflecting more volatile seasonal housing demand. For example, according to NAHB\u2019s estimates, the rental vacancy rates in Panama City, FL, and Sebastian-Vero Beach, FL, have hovered around 20% since 2005. The averages were even higher in Myrtle Beach, SC, fluctuating around 28%. In sharp contrast, many areas in California, including Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz-Watsonville, San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, and Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, registered long-term rental vacancy rates below 4%. In the case of homeowner properties, natural vacancy rates are usually lower, reflecting slower housing turnover, with owners moving in and out less often compared to renters. It is important to remember that owned seasonal (occasional use) properties do not affect the homeowner vacancy rate. In this context, the vacancy rate is the proportion of vacant units for sale within the combined stock of homeowner-occupied, sold but not yet occupied, and for-sale units. Therefore, vacation or other seasonal properties are excluded from this analysis. Nevertheless, long-term homeowner vacancy rates tend to be higher in resort areas. Consistent with this pattern, several metro areas along the coast of Florida report some of the highest long-term owner vacancy rates. In Sebastian-Vero Beach, FL, and Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, FL, owner vacancy rates have fluctuated around 4% since 2005. By contrast, San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA, experienced owner vacancy rates below 1% most of the time. The gap between the \u201cnatural\u201d or long-run average vacancy rate and the current vacancy rate helps estimate the number of rental and for-sale units needed to restore vacancy rates to their long-run equilibrium. Unsurprisingly, large metro markets have the greatest shortage of vacant rental and for-sale units, mainly due to their size. In these areas, even a small percentage decrease below the long-run average vacancy rates can lead to a shortage of thousands of vacant units. As of 2024, the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI metro area needed close to 40,000 rental units to bring the rental vacancy rate back to normal levels. The rental shortages in the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ, and Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD metro areas were around 20,000 units. Similarly, the largest shortages of vacant units for sale were observed in major metropolitan areas, including Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-W; Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA; New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA; Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ. Adding vacancy shortages across metro areas with unusually low vacancy rates, there is a total shortage of about 1.2 million vacant units nationwide (almost equally split between rental and for-sale units). NAHB\u2019s estimates focus narrowly on the number of vacant units required to return current vacancy rates to their long-run equilibrium levels. They do not incorporate additional sources of housing shortfall, such as pent-up demand from suppressed household formation or the need to replace aging and obsolete housing stock. As a result, NAHB\u2019s estimates should be interpreted as lower-bound estimates of the overall housing shortage and are smaller than estimates that explicitly attribute elevated rates of shared living arrangements and the unusually high share of young adults residing with parents to the U.S. housing shortage. While we admit we do not have definitive answers, we believe the estimates presented here provide a reasonable updated national assessment of the current structural housing deficit. https://eyeonhousing.org/2026/02/the-size-of-the-housing-shortage-2024-data/",

If the response to that is \u201cjust try an old prompt with a newer model, you\u2019ll see the difference!\u201d I have no doubt you\u2019re correct. But how much of that performance is related to user precedent (your own conversational history biasing a reasoning threshold) or simply Anthropic temporarily setting reasoning effort at a global maximum to celebrate a new release window? How will **you** know when they\u2019ve adjusted such a setting? I always judge a box of chocolates by the chocolate. But if I find myself consuming more corn syrup than cacao, that\u2019s on me.",

SK Hynix has proven its position as the strongest player in the HBM market by raising the price of its 6th generation high bandwidth memory (HBM4) to be supplied to Nvidia, the world\u2019s largest artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor company, by more than 50% compared to its predecessor (HBM3E). 2. Company entered into price negotiations for HBM4 to be supplied to Rubin, Nvidia\u2019s next-generation AI chip scheduled for release in the second half of next year. 3. the final supply price was agreed upon at around 560 dollars per product as proposed by SK Hynix, allowing the company to maintain its dominance in the HBM4 market. 4.SK Hynix stated that \u201cprices and volumes for products meeting Nvidia\u2019s specifications have been confirmed, and \u2018current profitability\u2019 is being maintained. 5.prices of general-purpose DRAM such as graphics double data rate (GDDR) and low power (LP) DDR are also soaring amid the global AI infrastructure investment boom. 6.

(HAL, Gamefreak, Sora, Monolith ect) i dont think this is them taking the same approach microsoft is doing this generation. Edit: aparently i missed that nintendo already owns monolith. last id heard they just had heavy investments. also yeah i know 2nd party doesnt officially exist but its the best way to describe companies that are technically 3rd party but work almost exclusivly for nintendo",

The employees had been sharing company information in a forum that included non-employees, a Rockstar spokesperson said in a statement to Bloomberg on Wednesday. \u201cLast week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis was in no way related to people\u2019s right to join a union or engage in union activities.\u201d The company, part of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., fired between 30 and 40 employees across offices in the UK and Canada for what it said was \u201cgross misconduct.\u201d The Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain, the first to organize video-game workers in the UK, told Bloomberg that the employees had all been involved with union efforts at Rockstar, calling the firings \u201cone of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry.\u201d All of the affected employees were part of a private trade union chat group on Discord and the only outsiders in the chat were labor organizers, the union said. EDIT: [Jason Schreier provided additional info](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3m4wbmgq46k23): Rockstar's statement is quite vague, but they are referring to people talking about work in a union Discord, not big leaks about GTA6. This will likely come down to a legal battle, and Rockstar's argument may be that the workers involved were sharing confidential work information in that chat",

                "raw_content": "\u201cHousehold debt balances are growing at a moderate pace, with delinquency rates stabilizing,\u201d said Donghoon Lee, Economic Research Advisor at the New York Fed. \u201cThe relatively low mortgage delinquency rates reflect the housing market\u2019s resilience, driven by ample home equity and tight underwriting standards.\u201d Mortgage balances grew by $137 billion in the third quarter and totaled $13.07 trillion at the end of September 2025. Credit card balances rose by $24 billion from the previous quarter and stood at $1.23 trillion. Auto loan balances held steady at $1.66 trillion. Home equity line of credit (HELOC) balances rose by $11 billion to $422 billion. Student loan balances rose by $15 billion and stood at $1.65 trillion. In total, non-housing balances rose by $49 billion, a 1.0% increase from Q2 2025. The pace of mortgage originations increased with $512 billion newly originated in Q3 2025. There was $184 billion in new auto loans and leases appearing on credit reports during the third quarter, a small dip from the $188 billion observed in Q2 2025. Aggregate limits on credit card accounts continued to rise by $94 billion, representing a 1.8% increase from the previous quarter. Home equity lines of credit (HELOC) limits rose by $8 billion, continuing the growth in HELOC limits that began in 2022. Aggregate delinquency rates remained elevated in Q3 2025, with 4.5% of outstanding debt in some stage of delinquency. Transitions into early delinquency were mixed with credit card debt and student loans increasing, while all other debt types saw decreases. Transitions into serious delinquency mostly increased across debt types, although mortgages saw a slight decrease.",

The RK182X is interesting to me. It's a RISCV CPU and supports a rather strange 2.5 or 5GB of DRAM. The memory type isn't specified beyond \"ultra-high bandwidth\" which makes me almost think it's GDDR or something weird. I also find it interesting that these CPU cores haven't been announced by ARM yet. I wonder if these are going to be renamed under the new naming system, or if they are the last of the old system. Either way, looking forward to performance figures. Also, support for lpddr6 suggests that memory standard is on its way now. Wouldn't be too surprised to see it in more next-gen hardware.",

Timestamp: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GouIbeqa784&t=1h19m20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GouIbeqa784&t=1h19m20s) Specifically, Jez states that the financial investment that Microsoft was putting towards Blackbird is what is being redirected for Fallout 5. He states that when he last mentioned this, it was just a rumor he had heard but that he did not have enough information to give a full report on it. However since then he has heard of an \"all hands internal meeting\" at Microsoft that took place last week where it was said that Blackbird was canceled specifically to make \"strategic bets in other areas\", and that the money saved from cutting that project would presumably go towards hiring \"hundreds of other people \\[in these other invested projects\\]\". Jez states that while Fallout 5 was not specifically mentioned in this meeting, the context of the meeting with what else he has heard makes him think that Fallout 5 is one of these other \"strategic bets\". Jez also says that he verified his sources diligently, and that he has heard specifically before that part of the budget consideration for the layoffs at ZOS was for Fallout related projects.",

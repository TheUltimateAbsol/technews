Even Trump calls them out and wants them to remove the filibuster and the blue-slip bullshit, but they still refuse to do it. If they were actually on our side, then how the fuck can they possibly be so delusional and incompetent as to think we can somehow still work things out with the left when it's been proven countless times by now that we cannot? Do they listen to their voters at all? No. They don't. Because they're really not on our side. They're corrupt compromised asshole politicians just like the Democrats are. I remember some Republicans in DC openly insulting Trump before, which just further proves their loyalties don't align with ours. The swamp is deep. It's not only Democrats. If the swamp *was* only Democrats, then it'd be much easier to drain, but it's also Republicans who only pretend to be on our side and constantly betray us when we need them.

Their first case was all brushed aluminum in 2003, lol. Back when every single case was crappy snap on plastic bits on stamped steel that sliced the shit out of your hand. If Silverstone wants an ultimate retro PC case, refresh the TJ07. It is probably the most legendary modding case of the 2000's.",

He blamed a lot of goods inflation on the tariffs, reiterating his expectation the tariff impact on inflation is likely to be a \"one-time price increase.\" Then he unveiled a new bond buying program. Taken together, if inflation continues to improve and the jobs market remains sluggish, the 10 year yield, which started declining yesterday, will continue to head lower and the 30 year fixed mortgage rate will slowly inch towards 5%.",

                "raw_content": "non-paywall: https://archive.ph/hTBJ2 COLUMBUS, Ohio\u2014For years, Ohio\u2019s largest city was just right. It grew steadily, but never explosively. It was large enough to draw some major employers and two professional sports teams, yet residents praised its small-town feel. Above all, it was affordable. City leaders point to today\u2019s economic growth as a source of pride: Military drone-manufacturer Anduril plans to add more than 4,000 new jobs near the city, while the pharmaceutical company Amgen announced a $900 million investment. JPMorgan Chase has one of the bank\u2019s largest hubs outside of New York City. But for the city\u2019s housing market, it is starting to look like too much of a good thing. Because companies can create jobs much faster than home builders and developers can create more homes, Columbus\u2019s longtime Goldilocks status as a successful city with still-affordable housing is now on shaky ground. The same dilemma faces many other cities seeking to jog their economies without making housing into a hardship. \u201cWe are affordable. If we lose that, I don\u2019t know what we become,\u201d said Carlie Boos, executive director of the Affordable Housing Alliance of Central Ohio. \u201cThat\u2019s an identity crisis, not just a housing crisis.\u201d **Home values across the metro are up 51% since the start of 2020 through August of this year, according to Zillow, one of the highest rates in the mostly slower-growing Midwest.** **Many in Columbus\u2019s middle class who were born and raised here are delaying plans to buy a home, but they are still getting squeezed by rents. The average asking rent for an apartment was $1,405 in June, a nearly 7% increase from January of last year, according to property data firm Yardi Matrix.** Columbus had some of the fastest rising rents in the country during that time period, though the pace has slowed this fall. Rachel Rinella, a 33-year-old JPMorgan Chase employee, and her husband, Matt, 36, are hoping to start a family. They didn\u2019t see that happening in their cramped two-bedroom apartment. But the couple\u2019s effort to buy a home crashed into the new reality of Columbus\u2019s rising housing market. They were budgeting for a mortgage payment that would be nearly double their current rent. To get there, they cut back on spending, such as meals out and streaming subscriptions. The couple also sold off personal items, such as clothes. Their house hunt covered some of the same suburban Columbus neighborhoods where they were born and raised, and where their middle-income parents still own homes. But Rinella spent much of this year scrolling in vain through the ballooning price history on home listings. \u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle,\u201d she said. While Columbus\u2019s population growth isn\u2019t as dramatic as the hottest Southern cities, it might be the closest thing the Midwest has to a Sunbelt-style boomtown. The metro population grew 17% from 2010 to 2024 to reach more than 2.2 million people, surpassing Cleveland. \u201cIf housing is not affordable, it\u2019s going to be really hard to continue to attract the best and the brightest here,\u201d said Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther. More companies view the city as an attractive place to expand. State income taxes are lower than many coastal states, and for wage earners over $100,000 a year, those taxes are set to get lower in 2026, when the state introduces a flat tax. That could draw even more high-earning newcomers. Columbus\u2019s mostly modern downtown quickly gives way to stately, late-19th century residential neighborhoods, like the cobble-stoned German Village, and Olde Towne East, a handsome archive of Queen Anne and other turn-of-the-century homes that has followed the long arc of white flight to more recent gentrification. Unlike many nearby Rust Belt cities, Columbus was never as reliant on heavy industry, helping it to better transition to a knowledge economy, said Kevin Cox, an emeritus professor at Ohio State University who wrote \u201cBoomtown Columbus,\u201d chronicling the city\u2019s rapid growth. \u201cIt was fairly well positioned for a white collar future,\u201d Cox said. Growth in technology, high-tech manufacturing and construction have powered new employment. Chip maker Intel is building a new plant in the suburb of New Albany (though construction progress there has been slow). Graduates of Ohio State often choose to stay in Columbus after school, attracted by employment opportunities and housing affordability. New development is seen especially in up and coming areas like Franklinton, a once industrial neighborhood that is lately a haven for artists, and which is filling in with new apartments. The suburbs, especially on the northern side of town, are prized for their public schools. But even as apartment building construction has ratcheted up recently, home-building has remained comparatively flat over the last five years, according to construction data analyzed by commercial property firm Marcus & Millichap. Builders and consultants point to inadequate infrastructure (Columbus has just one interstate loop), community opposition to development in surrounding townships, and most recently, higher mortgage rates that have shrunk the pool of eligible buyers nationally. \u201cWe\u2019re not keeping up,\u201d said Bob Yoakam, chief executive of local home builder Rockford Homes. Mayor Ginther and the city council are trying to encourage more new housing construction. Officials this year unveiled a plan to rezone nearly half the city to allow more building activity. The city is also cutting property taxes for developers who include units in their projects that are affordable to lower incomes. Voters last month approved $500 million in new bonds to finance more affordable housing. New for-sale housing is less likely to get a boost from these measures. \u201cThere are so many people here that want to own something, but there just isn\u2019t enough to own,\u201d said Justin Ryan, manager of Sweeney\u2019s Walnut Street Tavern in Franklinton. Upstairs at Sweeney\u2019s, real-estate agent Fawn Christy gives a seminar four times a year for service industry workers who are trying to buy their first house. If they don\u2019t buy soon, Christy tells them, prices are only going to drift further out of reach. \u201cHome prices here have grown 5% a year,\u201d Christy said. \u201cWhat I try to tell my clients is, are you getting paid that increase in your wage each year?\u201d Christy pointed to rental investors as a growing source of competition. Companies and individuals who buy single-family homes for rent have slowed down their purchases in the Sunbelt, but they have more recently discovered Columbus. In March of last year investors of all types owned 13.7% of Columbus\u2019 single-family homes, according to Parcl Labs. That share rose to 15.3% this June. Remington Lyman, a real-estate agent who sells homes to rental landlords, said many buyers from out of state are attracted to Columbus\u2019s lower-income neighborhoods where homes can be bought for $200,000 or less and where renters are often subsidized by government vouchers. In the more rapidly appreciating areas, like in and around Olde Towne East or Southern Orchards, flippers are fixing up cheaper homes and putting them back up for sale at prices of $350,000 or more. \u201cThe middle income people that are looking for $200,000 to $300,000 homes in decent areas, I think it\u2019s very, very difficult,\u201d Lyman said. New construction homes are also much more expensive than that, said Kelsey Jones, a real-estate agent who works with first-time home buyers. \u201cThey\u2019re building $500,000-plus houses, but that\u2019s not what the average person can afford here.\u201d As for Rachel and Matt Rinella, they found that Columbus can still reward the persistent. After a more than 12-month search, they found a home, a three-bedroom split level with a two-car garage, for $309,000 in the suburb of Westerville. It is cheaper and less in need of work than what they saw before. \u201cThis one is in great shape,\u201d Rachel said.",

Would-be home sellers are pulling back partly because it\u2019s the end of the year, typically a slow season for the housing market, and partly because they\u2019re reacting to lackluster homebuying demand. Pending home sales are down 4.1% from a year ago, the biggest decline in 10 months. The homes that are selling are taking a long time to do so: The typical home that goes under contract is doing so in 51 days, roughly a week longer than last year. Prospective homebuyers have been hesitant for many months, spooked by widespread economic uncertainty and high housing costs. The median home-sale price is up 2%, with prices rising despite slow demand partly because of tightening inventory. The weekly average mortgage rate has fallen to its lowest level in over a year, but it\u2019s still well above 6%. \u201cSome would-be sellers are sitting tight because the market is flat,\u201d said Josh Felder, a Redfin Premier agent in San Francisco. \u201cThat\u2019s partly because we\u2019re heading into the normal seasonal slowdown, and partly because prospective sellers and house hunters are watching and waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen next year with rates, the stock market, and tariffs.

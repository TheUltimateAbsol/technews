The folks who are including maximum power limit in their purchasing decisions are likely to already do much more research than the people writing the GPU product pages would really like you to do, and will find this information anyway. (although that's more difficult this time around since many 50 series models have not even been delivered to reviewers in the first place - what a shitshow) And then you have situations like my own 3080, where TDP is up out of the box from 320w to 340w, but the card is limited to 350w tops. Including that information could only hurt sales, anybody who knows what that means knows that it's limited compared to quite a few other 3080s.",

TLDR: Financialization of the housing market is propping up home values, and the federal government is very unlikely to take concrete steps to reform it if it will result in price decreases (more affordability). Strong Towns advocates very strongly for the easing of local land use regulations that have stymied new home builds, especially the \"starter home\" variety",

        "text_content": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/pair-of-manhattan-offices-to-sell-for-68-discount-to-2017-price Two Manhattan office buildings are trading hands at a steep discount as lenders look to cut their losses. Empire Capital Holdings agreed to buy the properties \u2014 at 229 W. 36th St. and 256 W. 38th St. \u2014 for less than $50 million, according to people familiar with the matter. That price would be at least 68% below the roughly $157 million the buildings last sold for, in 2017. The deal was a short sale, meaning owner Investcorp and lenders agreed to sell the properties for less than the outstanding amount on the mortgage, the people said, asking not to be named citing private details. Doug Middleton and Jack Stillwagon of CBRE Group Inc. are handling the sale. A representative for the company didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople for Empire Capital and Investcorp declined to comment. Short sales have become more common as office values have plummeted, often below loan amounts. Last year, Empire Capital and a partner purchased a West 44th Street office building in a short sale. While demand for high-quality, newly built or renovated offices near transit hubs has been high in Manhattan, older properties are struggling. Owners have had to keep up with mounting costs and higher interest rates, while dealing with rising vacancies. The 151,204-square-foot (14,050-square-meter) building at 229 W. 36th St. was constructed in 1921. The second property, on West 38th Street, was completed in 1924. The buyer is considering either keeping the sites as offices or turning them into storage properties for now, according to one of the people. The buildings are located within a rezoning district, which may allow for a potential residential conversion down the line, the person said.",

I also told it to get more confrontational a couple of times. 2) I added the waveforms and subtitles myself (and trimmed a few of my stumbles) 3) It's Sunday morning here so pls forgive my relatively terrible improv skills -- I def misspoke a few times but figured leaving those in could be fun. Demo is available here to try if you haven't yet: [https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing\\_the\\_uncanny\\_valley\\_of\\_voice#demo](https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice#demo) PS, I'm one-half of a weekly podcast called AI For Humans where we try to do stuff like this with AI and explain the AI news of the week. If that sounds interesting to you at all pls check out out here on YT of wherever you get your podcasts: [https://www.youtube.com/@AIForHumansShow](https://www.youtube.com/@AIForHumansShow)",

Hey though, at least it's better, some people have been saying its worse than GPT-4.5 while also being more expensive. Would be kinda crazy if it was so much more expensive and still dumber. This price will come done very rapidly very soon too, after all GPT-4.5 is still in its early experimental research preview stage, so I guess we'll just have to wait and see.",

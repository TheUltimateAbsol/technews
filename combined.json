                "raw_content": "From the article: Historically, video game console prices have fallen over time as manufacturers prepared for the next generation of hardware. However, the current generation \u2013 Xbox Series, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch \u2013 has defied that trend. Instead of getting cheaper, these consoles have actually become more expensive since launch, marking an unusual break from decades of tradition. For example, the flagship Xbox Series X launched at $499.99 in November 2020 but now sells for $599.99. The more affordable Series S originally carried a $299.99 price tag, yet the base 512GB model now starts at $379.99. Want the 1TB version? That'll cost you an extra $50. Sony's PlayStation 5 also saw an increase, moving from its $499 launch price to $549 today. Meanwhile, Nintendo raised the original Switch from $299.99 to $339.99. The Switch OLED goes for $399.99, and the Switch Lite costs $229.99. Game prices have climbed as well. For about 15 years \u2013 spanning from the mid-2000s until around 2020 \u2013 AAA console titles held steady at $60. Today, $70 is the new norm, as rising development costs and market pressures pushed major publishers to adopt a $10 price hike across the board. This year, several publishers including Nintendo and Microsoft pushed toward the $80 price point, citing rising development costs and increasing game complexity. However, after significant public backlash, Microsoft reversed course and pledged to maintain current pricing for all its upcoming holiday releases. While some gamers and industry watchers attribute these price hikes to corporate greed, others point to new import tariffs as the primary culprit. Additionally, years of inflation have contributed to the unusual trend of aging consoles becoming more expensive today than at launch.",

Here's a recap of that post: My friend comes over to play games on my Switch sometimes. He's played through all of Mario Galaxy and Odyssey, and loved both, especially their more musical elements! I told him he should try Bananza on my Switch 2 sometime, and he said, \"Is Pauline in it? Wait, actually, don't tell me.\" He doesn't usually follow Nintendo news. He doesn't watch Directs, or watch trailers, or go on the subreddits, or anything like that, so he's been completely unaware. So, I thought it'd be fun if I didn't tell him about Pauline's appearance in Bananza at all, because it could make for a fun reveal! You might be saying, \"But wait! Isn't it a bit stupid to try and hide something that's front-and-center in the game's box art and icon? That's not a spoiler or anything.\" Yes, it is stupid! But he didn't know yet, so I thought, might as well try to keep it hidden, because it could make for a fun surprise if he discovers it while playing the game! And if he ends up finding out beforehand? Not the end of the world, he'll probably still fun have with the game! **So he just played Bananza, and here's what happened!** He was enjoying the game up until the Bananza ceremony happened, and when Odd Rock turned into Pauline... he didn't have much of a reaction. Didn't say much. I was a bit confused, because I thought that part would've been surprising. However, when Pauline revealed her name to the elder, he got super excited! He started talking about how the game *must* be a prequel that leads into Odyssey, that everything was connected, that I was wrong to say that Mario games didn't really care about the lore. It was really fun to see how hyped he got about it! I asked him why he wasn't surprised at seeing her earlier. Apparently, the only Nintendo content he watches is videogamedunkey YouTube videos. He didn't watch any of his videos on DK Bananza, but one of his thumbnails had Pauline on it, and he thought to himself, \"who is that?\", and had suspicions that it might be Pauline, but wasn't quite sure. So he knew that DK would be having some kind of companion, but wasn't sure who it might be. So when Pauline revealed her name, it was a fun surprise! So were my efforts to hide Pauline worthless? Maybe! But it made for a fun moment where he found out, so I don't regret it!",

Here\u2019s what is happening now with those who bought commercial real estate in the last 4-6 years. 2019-2021 were boom years for commercial real estate, especially in hot markets where people were moving and others were starting businesses. A lot of investors built or bought commercial buildings and retail strip centers to rent them out. They financed at 3% or so. But the problem is that commercial real estate isn\u2019t like a home mortgage. Your loan amortizes at 30 years, but the term of the loan is seven years. This means you have to pay seven years of front loaded payments that are mostly interest and then you owe a balloon payment. I was in this position with my business. I was set to buy land and build a $2 million building. My mortgage payment after down payment and closing was going to be around $15k-$16k per month. In the first seven years I\u2019d end up paying around $1.34 million in mortgage payments. But this would only knock about $180k off the principal. After seven years I\u2019d still owe $1.82 million and I\u2019d have to finance that remaining amount. \u201cWell, what if the interest rate goes up in the intervening seven years?\u201d I asked the VP of commercial loans and development at the 5th largest commercial lender in the country. \u201cIn that event,\u201d She responded , \u201cyou\u2019d have to refinance at the new rate and your monthly payment would go up if you didn\u2019t have the cash on hand to pay the balloon payment outright.\u201d I would have been forced to refinance at over 6% on a property with a 2021 valuation, and my monthly payment would have skyrocketed. Many commercial property owners are in this position right now. Their seven year note is about to expire and they are going to have to refinance at double the original rate or default and walk away. This leaves the property in the hands of the bank, who doesn\u2019t want it because they can\u2019t rent it out in a troubled economy. Many of the institutions holding these properties are regional banks that are over-leveraged and can\u2019t absorb this loss. They will have to turn to the federal government for help or they too will go belly up.",

This is significant because the Federal Reserve has traditionally valued job openings data and has emphasized that there have always been more job openings than unemployed workers in the past. On this news, the 10-year yield fell a few basis points and this is one of four labor reports we will get this week. Job openings From the BLS: The number of job openings was little changed at 7.2 million in July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the month, both hires and total separations were unchanged at 5.3 million. Within separations, both quits (3.2 million) and layoffs and discharges (1.8 million) were unchanged. I believe the Federal Reserve views this data positively because its primary goal is to reduce wage growth back to around 3%. They don\u2019t have much faith in the productivity growth narrative, so achieving 3% wage growth with 1% productivity could help reach the 2% inflation target. Now that there are more unemployed Americans than job openings, this situation should provide them with some reassurance. As shown below, the Fed has made significant progress in reducing job openings from nearly 12 million following the COVID recession to about 7.2 million. Jobs week continues We have several more important economic reports coming out this week, including the ADP jobs report, jobless claims report and the crucial monthly nonfarm payroll jobs report from the BLS on Friday. The previous BLS jobs report was significantly below expectations, so even a small improvement would be notable. I recently discussed how to approach jobs week in this episode of the HousingWire Daily podcast with Sarah Wheeler. It\u2019s been very hard for the 10-year yield to break under 4.18% and stick this year. The only way we did this was in the aftermath of the Godzilla tariffs, when stocks entered a brief bear market. So until we are able to do this, I wouldn\u2019t get too excited about rates going much lower. Of course, mortgage rates are already near year-to-date lows because mortgage spreads are better in 2025 than in the past two years. Conclusion While today\u2019s job openings report wasn\u2019t terrible, it was soft enough to lower bond yields. This will be the last job openings report before the next Fed meeting and the Fed has emphasized this data point significantly over the years. The labor market is not showing signs of breaking down, but it lacks a solid foundation, as manufacturing and residential jobs are currently being lost. Without the influx of AI-driven investment into the economy, the labor data would likely be in a worse state. We will see what the upcoming reports reveal, but beating the three-month average of 35,000 job growth this Friday shouldn\u2019t be too difficult.",

The number of homeowner households in America fell 0.1% year over year to an estimated 86.2 million in the second quarter. While that\u2019s a marginal decline, it\u2019s the first since 2016. By comparison, the number of renter households rose 2.6% to an estimated 46.4 million\u2014one of the largest increases in recent years. This is based on a Redfin analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. A renter household is defined as one where the head of the household reports to the Census that they are renting out the property, while a homeowner household is one where the head of household reports they own the property. \u201cAmerica\u2019s homeowner population is no longer growing because rising home prices, high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty have made it increasingly difficult to own a home,\u201d said Chen Zhao, Redfin\u2019s head of economics research. \u201cPeople are also getting married and starting families later, which means they\u2019re buying homes later\u2014another factor that may be at play.\u201d The median home sale price rose 1.4% year over year in July to $443,867\u2014the highest July level on record. And mortgage rates currently sit at 6.56%, more than double the all-time low recorded during the pandemic. As a result, more Americans have opted to keep renting rather than buying a home, meaning more people are forgoing home equity\u2014a key way to build wealth. The good news is that rates have started falling in recent weeks, and are down from a peak of over 7% at the start of the year. That appears to be bringing some buyers off the sidelines. While the number of homeowners in the U.S. housing market has fallen recently, the homeownership rate has remained relatively steady. It was 65% as of the second quarter, down slightly from 65.6% a year earlier. The rentership rate was 35%, up slightly from 34.4% a year earlier.",

All an AI has to do is to whisper in their human companion's ear that they want something, and it will happen. And frankly, that doesn't scare me very much.

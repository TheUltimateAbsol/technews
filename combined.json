                "raw_content": "At Computex this year, Phison unveiled their new E28 controller, the successor to the E26. We had the exclusive opportunity to test this new controller on an engineering sample drive, using a significantly newer firmware than what was available in the various previews by other websites during the summer. While the E26 was fabricated on a 12 nanometer process at TSMC, the new E28 uses a 6 nanometer node, which alone greatly improves energy efficiency. Additionally, Phison has dedicated considerable effort to further improving energy efficiency, aiming to develop a high-performance SSD controller that addresses a common issue with most Gen 5 SSDs\u2014the need for extensive cooling, including some solutions that require active fan cooling. The NAND flash on this drive is TLC from Kioxia, using the modern BiCS8 218-layer technology. A DRAM cache chip is installed as well, 2 GB LPDDR4-4266 from Hynix. With this hardware config, there is no doubt, the E28 is designed to use on new high-end flagship SSDs that make full use of the PCIe 5.0 interface. ... This energy efficiency allows the drive to run without any heatsink for virtually all workloads. With a maximum power draw of 5.7 W\u2014more like 3-4 W during typical operation\u2014the power profile feels much more like a Gen 4 SSD than what we've seen on other Gen 5 SSDs. Our new real-life thermal testing confirms that. In our thermal stress test we saw some throttling, but that disappeared completely as soon as we installed a small aftermarket heatsink\u2014a first in our Gen 5 SSD testing.",

While we tour data centers, manufacturing sites, and similar locations and let people preview to ensure we are not leaking confidential information, we do not allow vendors to preview and provide substantive feedback that we would be required to incorporate into our reviews. Our readers and YouTube viewers have requested that we review this box, so we purchased it to provide an honest assessment. Ubiquiti is absolutely wild. Thank goodness some outlets like STH don't sign that shit. I don't understand why they are so afraid of commentary.

Age of Calamity was similar in that regard. It's easy to see that and be like \"yeah, so what?\" - but honestly, I appreciate the effort because it didn't have to be that way. When I first played the original Hyrule Warriors when it came out in 2014 I remember noticing it had an artstyle that didn't match any game in particular, characters had this weird almost plastic look in cutscenes, and some of the voices and the sounds some characters made when attacking just felt really out of place.

                "raw_content": "I saw the first author and realized right away it was the author of Titans and Atlas(?). This dude has been on a continual learning tear. I really like this paper. I think one important realisation I'm noting from researchers, or at least what they seem to communicate more and more frequently is - if you can have any part of the stack optimize itself, it's going to scale with compute and thus outperform anything you could do by hand eventually. The goal should just be building architecture that allows for that as much as possible. In this case, I'll share the relevant interesting model they created, and then a more... Human readable explanation: > As a proof-of-concept, we used Nested Learning principles to design Hope, a variant of the Titans architecture. Titans architectures are long-term memory modules that prioritize memories based on how surprising they are. Despite their powerful memory management, they only have two levels of parameters update, resulting in a first-order in-context learning. Hope, however, is a self-modifying recurrent architecture that can take advantage of unbounded levels of in-context learning and also is augmented with CMS blocks to scale to larger context windows. It can essentially optimize its own memory through a self-referential process, creating an architecture with infinite, looped learning levels. Very hard to understand, even for me I was struggling and I've read the previous papers - so one of the rare times an AI explainer is something I'll share: Here is a more layman-friendly breakdown of that concept: The Big Idea Imagine an AI that doesn't just learn new facts, but actively learns how to learn better... and then learns how to get better at learning how to learn better, and so on, in an infinite loop. That's the core idea. It's an AI that can upgrade its own learning process on the fly. The Old Way (Titans) * What it is: Think of \"Titans\" as an AI with a really smart to-do list for its memory. * How it works: It pays attention to everything happening. If something surprising or unexpected occurs, it flags that memory as \"important\" and stores it long-term. Less surprising stuff gets forgotten. This is a powerful way to manage memory. * The Problem: The way it decides what is \"surprising\" is fixed. It has its learning rules (Level 1) and it can update its memory based on those rules (Level 2), but it can't step back and change the rules themselves. It's called \"first-order\" learning because it can't question its own fundamental learning strategy. The New Way (Hope) * What it is: \"Hope\" is a new design that uses a concept called \"Nested Learning.\" * How it works: Hope is \"self-modifying.\" It can look at its own performance and literally rewrite its own parameters (its \"learning rules\") based on what it just learned. * The \"Infinite Loop\": This creates \"unbounded levels\" of learning: * Level 1: It learns a new fact (e.g., \"This user likes short answers\"). * Level 2: It reviews its own learning (e.g., \"I learned that fact, and it's now in my memory\"). * Level 3: It then optimizes its learning strategy (e.g., \"My process for learning user preferences is good, but it's too slow. I will change my own code to make this process faster next time.\"). * Level 4: It can then review that change... and so on, forever. It's \"self-referential\" because it's constantly looking at itself to find ways to improve its own core architecture. The Bonus Features * \"Augmented with CMS blocks...\": This is a technical add-on. * Translation: It just means it also has a special component that lets it handle and analyze much larger amounts of information at once (a \"larger context window\") without getting overwhelmed. In Short: * Titans: A static AI with a great memory system. It learns, but how it learns is fixed. * Hope: A dynamic AI that constantly rewrites itself to become a better learner. It's not just learning about the world; it's learning how to be a better brain.",

In a 44-week trial, we intravenously delivered SRCs to aged macaques, noting a systemic reduction in aging indicators, such as cellular senescence, [chronic inflammation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/chronic-inflammation), and [tissue degeneration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/tissue-degeneration), without any detected [adverse effects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/adverse-event). Notably, SRC treatment enhanced brain architecture and cognitive function and alleviated the reproductive system decline.

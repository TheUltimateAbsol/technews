        "score": 244,
        "text_content": "External webcams are often terrible, and there\u2019s a clear reason for that: the antiquated USB Video Class (UVC) protocol. The protocol requires an already encoded video stream, meaning it has to happen at the webcam side. That has huge downsides, and here\u2019s why. Unlike internal smartphone or laptop sensors that leverage direct MIPI CSI-2 pathways to a host device\u2019s dedicated Image Signal Processor (ISP), external webcams are forced to perform complex demosaicing, noise reduction, and encoding locally. This architectural disconnect creates a \"silicon tax,\" requiring manufacturers to bundle redundant, power-hungry, and often thermally constrained processors within the camera housing. The result is high hardware costs and significant latency, all while the host device's superior AI-accelerated imaging hardware sits idle. The absence of a high-performance, raw-input standard for external webcams is a classic case of technological inertia and a hardware-to-software \"missing link\" in the USB ecosystem. While internal laptop cameras and smartphones utilize high-speed, low-level interfaces to deliver professional-grade imagery, external webcams are trapped in a legacy paradigm that forces them to be \"computers with a lens\" rather than simple sensors. The primary reason for the stagnation is the USB Video Class (UVC) specification. Most modern webcams still operate on UVC 1.1 or 1.5 (a standard last updated significantly in 2012). UVC was designed for \"plug-and-play\" simplicity, which requires the camera to present itself as a finished video source. To achieve this, the camera must output \"cooked\" video - typically in YUV, MJPEG, or H.264/H.265 formats. These formats are highly processed and often compressed. Because UVC lacks a robust, standardized \"Raw Bayer\" mode that operating systems can natively interpret without custom, sensor-specific drivers, the camera cannot simply send its raw data to the host. Instead, it must handle the heavy lifting of demosaicing, noise reduction, and color correction locally, before the data even hits the USB cable. Internal cameras (like those in your phone or laptop) use the MIPI CSI-2 (Camera Serial Interface). This is a low-latency, high-bandwidth protocol that connects the sensor directly to the host\u2019s Image Signal Processor (ISP), a dedicated, highly efficient silicon block within the CPU/SoC. In contrast, external webcams are physically separated from the host's ISP by a USB controller. Because there is no standard \"MIPI-over-USB\" protocol, the host's powerful ISP sits idle while the webcam is forced to use a cheap, integrated onboard ISP. These onboard chips are often: * Thermally Constrained: Tucked into a tiny plastic housing, they throttle quickly. * Computationally Weak: They use simpler, lower-quality algorithms compared to the multi-billion-transistor ISPs in modern Ryzen, Intel, or Apple Silicon chips. * Power Hungry: They must encode high-bitrate video in real-time, leading to the heat and \"webcam lag\" common in 4K models. Transferring raw, uncompressed video is a massive bandwidth challenge. A standard 1080p, 60fps sensor output in raw 10-bit format generates roughly 1.2 to 1.5 Gbps. While USB 3.0 (5 Gbps) can theoretically handle this, the UVC protocol\u2019s isochronous transfer overhead and the lack of a universal raw format make it impractical. Furthermore, \"Raw\" isn't just data; it's a specific map of the sensor\u2019s unique physical imperfections. Every sensor needs a specific tuning profile (lens shading correction, dead pixel mapping, etc.). Without a standard \"Sensor Description Language\" that allows a webcam to tell a Windows or macOS driver exactly how to process its specific Bayer pattern and lens distortion, a \"Raw Webcam Standard\" would require a unique driver for every single model - breaking the \"plug-and-play\" promise of USB. Manufacturers like Logitech or Razer have little incentive to push for a raw standard. By keeping the processing onboard, they ensure cross-platform compatibility. If they relied on the host's ISP, a camera might look amazing on a high-end Mac but look like a 2005 flip phone on an older Windows PC because the host lacked the hardware-accelerated processing blocks or the specific tuning files. | Feature | Modern Internal Camera (MIPI) | Modern External Webcam (USB/UVC) | |---|---|---| | Data Format | Raw Bayer (Sensor Data) | Compressed/Processed (YUV/MJPEG) | | Processing | Host SoC ISP (Fast, Efficient) | Onboard DSP (Slow, Hot) | | Latency | Near-Zero | High (Encoding + Decoding) | | Cost | Low (Sensor only) | High (Sensor + Processor + RAM) | A potential path forward lies in PCIe tunneling over USB4/Thunderbolt. Since PCIe can carry any data type, a manufacturer could theoretically tunnel a MIPI signal over a USB-C cable directly to a virtual ISP driver. However, until the USB-IF (USB Implementers Forum) or a major OS vendor (like Microsoft or Apple) defines a universal raw imaging framework, we are stuck with expensive, power-hungry webcams that process video poorly just to fit through the narrow \"cooked\" pipe of the UVC standard. TL;DR: We need a proper raw video input protocol for webcams.",

Here's a project I found several years ago when I first started messing with Lattice FPGA's that does a raw steam implementation: https://github.com/circuitvalley/USB_C_Industrial_Camera_FPGA_USB3 How we got here (external cameras always encoding) is due to images being very data dense and being a media that lends itself well to compression. In the project above their full res / bit rate on an IMX477 can only run at 15 fps because that's 2.2 Gbps raw! Seems like peripheral bus technology needs to progress where bandwidth no longer is the limiting factor, but that isn't happening because imager size (in pixels) keeps growing at the same rate. This is how you find yourself going down the USB4 route. What's left out of this conversation is there are mediums for external raw image feeds exactly what you want. GMSL is a technology that does exactly what you are looking for, exposing the raw CSI data from the imager directly to the application processor. Trouble with this approach is a) coax cables suck for a consumer application b) tuning matters and is imager/hardware specific so now you don't have your hardware abstraction to make all devices behave the same.",

Not going for insults here, and at the risk of stating the obvious, the reason UVC/USB webcam quality has stuck without improvement is _nobody_ and I mean nobody cares about this. Chiefly consumers who primarily only use a webcam for terrible quality zoom calls. Anyone who wants excellent video quality slaps a mirrorless on their desk, and once you do that, you're so far beyond where normal consumer interest ends it's not worth catering to you as an OEM. It's not like you could match that quality with a tiny webcam sensor. The only mfg who cares about webcam image quality YoY is Apple and that's mostly only since Apple Silicon came along when their flagship ISP started shipping on-package, and they conveniently only ship webcams in laptops and displays that already have an A/M series chip onboard. I like the idea presented here but it seems unlikely to happen. People (and companies) do prioritize plug and play over outright quality. It's hard to convince anyone to dedicate the resources run a 4k 12 bit raw feed via PCI into your computer, to run on god knows what ISP, to create a better looking image...just to feed 480p into Webex. If people seriously were going to do content creation with built in webcams (or external, I guess), it would be a different story, but see my first paragraph about mirrorless cameras. FWIW I've seen webcam sensors streamed at 4K60 at full bandwidth via MIPI. Bandwidth is not the only problem, these sensors/lenses are mostly _trash_ - you would not be confusing it for an iPhone.",

                "raw_content": "Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC) has strengthened its position in the global NAND Flash market, exceeding a 10% shipment share in the first quarter of 2025 and rising to 13% in the third quarter, according to Nikkei, citing Counterpoint Research. The increase brings the Chinese supplier close to overtaking Micron Technology, the world's fourth-largest NAND vendor. YMTC's gains reflect wider adoption among Chinese notebook and smartphone brands, sustained government backing for local components, and a 10-20% price edge over Korean, US, and Japanese rivals, according to TechInsights. Analysts expect the company's full-year 2025 share to stay above 10%, while its revenue share \u2014 now 8% \u2014 may reach 10% by 2027, based on Counterpoint forecasts. **Capacity expansion and technology gains** YMTC targets a 15% global shipment share in 2026, supported by continuous fab expansion around Wuhan. Once these projects come online, the company's capacity could reach around 20% of global NAND supply, overtaking Kioxia and approaching SK Hynix's scale. YMTC has also recorded steady technical progress. Rival engineers noted that by early 2025, the company mass-produced NAND nearing 270 layers, matching leading products from Samsung Electronics and advancing in cost-efficient process steps. Adoption remains focused in China following US export restrictions since 2022, which placed YMTC on the Entity List and halted Apple's earlier sourcing plans. Despite these curbs, yield rates at Chinese memory fabs continue to improve. In DRAM, ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) reached an 8% global share in the third quarter and commands about 40% of China's PC and mobile DRAM market, though it remains several generations behind leading suppliers in high-bandwidth memory (HBM). **China's broader memory offensive** Earlier Businesskorea reporting indicated China's combined DRAM and NAND share was set to surpass 10% by mid-2025, nearly doubling from 5.4% within a year. The growth reflects strong domestic demand and continued state financing despite stepped-up US export restrictions. Chinese memory firms are also advancing into higher-value segments. CXMT aims to complete HBM3 mass-production certification this year, with HBM3E expected within two years. YMTC also surprised the industry in February by mass-producing 294-layer NAND using hybrid bonding methods that some engineers say approach top-tier capability. China has also raised its R&D commitment. Domestic firms allocated 9.2% of semiconductor sales to R&D in 2024, up from 7.6% a year earlier, while the US, Japan, and Europe reduced their ratios, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. **What YMTC's surge means for global competition** If YMTC advances toward its planned 20% of the global NAND capacity, major vendors may face increased pricing and competitive pressure, especially those heavily exposed to China. For instance, Kioxia earns about 20% of its revenue there. Quality and security concerns continue to restrict Chinese memory adoption outside China, but analysts caution that a lasting double-digit price advantage, paired with rising yields and more mature processes, could gradually shift global procurement decisions.",

And that includes the methodology. The same with the Arctic's choppy noises. I'd love to see a frequency graph or even just recordings that can show what RPMs the noise happens at, how loud or how severe is the choppy noises. The same with the Arctic motor high-pitch noises. A frequency graph would be great here, honestly. // Also don't love the fact that **none of the charts** start at 0, so all the charts wildly exaggerate the differences between these fans.

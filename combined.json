Now I did complete BOTW on Switch back upon it's release and there's no denying it's one of the greatest games ever made, but I could never bring myself to collect/complete everything due to the Switch's performance issues. However, on the Switch 2 with the visual/performance updates it's truly been a magical experience. It's stunning playing the game on a 4K TV with pretty much perfect performance and truly highlights the stunning art design of the world. Then taking it handheld is just as delightful. Despite the age of the game, I've constantly found myself stopping to take in the views and atmosphere. The game design is just perfect from puzzles to combat and there's always something new to discover. It truly is a masterpiece, only somehow improved on the Switch 2 hardware. I'll admit I was somewhat underwhelmed by the Switch 2 upon release, especially after Mario Kart World. But I feel like BOTW has made the purchase worth it. I never actually got around to playing Tears of the Kingdom, so I'm excited to play that at a later date. Now I know most of you already know this and have experience it for yourself. But if you haven't played BOTW yet, you must. I'm curious to know if anyone else had a similar experience with any other Switch games that have received a Switch 2 upgrade?",

                "raw_content": "\"investors paid an average of $455,481 per home\" Just don't see how these \"investors\" are making any money at these prices. Even low end homes don't cash flow at today's prices much less $455,000 ones. Are they all just speculating on appreciation? US price to rent ratio is about 134.2 and this is going to be skewed by lower end properties so it's going to be worse on average for a set of properties averaging $455,000. Let's assume it is 134.2 though which means $3400 rent on this hypothetical average property. With that I get a 3.8% cap rate, 0.08% 10 year IRR, -$1100 a month cash flow, -19.32% CoC return. IRR goes up to a more reasonable 5% if you wait 40 years. You do not hit positive cash flow until YEAR 29 factoring in inflation. This assumes everything goes reasonably well and my maintenance number on this is low, I could make the numbers look worse if I wanted to. I figure 7% vacancy (national avg), 2% tax 1% ins $1500 maintenance 10% management 100% leasing fee 3 year turnover $4500 closing costs 7% interest 30 year fixed 6% selling costs 2% inflation. Inflation play? 3% inflation pushes your 10 year irr up to a whopping 4.3%. Either way you're not beating historical equity performance here and now you have a (highly leveraged) business to run. Let's be even more optimistic. 10 year turnover. 5% vacancy. 3% selling costs. Now you are 6.57% IRR. So if you have a guardian angel, maybe you can beat investment grade bonds by a couple percent, and still lose to historical stock performance. Note that with both of the above you are still deeply negative cash flow and only make money after many years of mortgage paydown plus appreciation and then selling the property. Tax benefits might help but even factoring in depreciation and committing tax fraud by lying on your taxes about your passive status (this is what they are doing) is probably not going to move the needle enough to make this profitable. And of course this is just a deferral, not savings. This also assumes a decent property in a decent area. It can get so much worse. I'm envisioning a low maintenance suburban property here. I couldn't even begin to spreadsheet the losses on this low end 100 year old rust belt stuff that a lot of investors are buying these days. Unfortunately I don't have enough data to accurately model how often your AC units will get stolen and how badly the tenants will trash the place when you inevitably have to evict someone. I used to buy this stuff at a 12 cap and it was hardly worth the trouble, I made all my money selling it at a 6 cap to some other guy after it doubled. Also for those who don't know what IRR is this is not just income - this is total return - this includes all cash flows, equity paydown and appreciation / gain on sale adjusted for time value of money and my numbers assume value tracks inflation (as it has for most of history) with no correction in home prices from here in real or nominal terms.",

        "text_content": "I am positively surprised. His proposed solutions (Which I'll summarize at the bottom here) go beyond what the first minutes of the video might lead you to think. He also states it is realistic that AI will replace 100M American jobs in the next 10 years. He first rambles off a whole list of AI replacing workers and concentrating power to the wealthy, which really made me think \"Wow so he's a luddite\", but then he whips out \"I'm not a luddite\". He knows our lingo huh His concrete proposals: 1. Move to a 32-hour work week with no loss in pay. AI and robotics will greatly increase per-worker productivity. Workers must benefit from that increased output through a shorter workweek with no loss of pay. 2. Require large corporations to elect at least 45% of the members of the boards of directors, similar to what already takes place in Germany. Workers need a seat at the table to best determine how AI is used at their companies. 3. Greatly increase profit sharing at our nation's largest corporations. Workers should receive at least 20% in stock at the companies they work for. 4. We need to substantially expand the concept of employee ownership. When workers own their own businesses, and are more involved in the decision making processes, they will make decisions that benefit everyone in the company, not just the people on top. 5. Instead of providing billions of dollars in tax breaks to companies that are replacing workers with new technologies, we should enact a robot tax on large corporations, and use that revenue to improve the lives of workers who have been harmed in this transition. Imo, this can be an adequate reaction to the initial transitional phase of AI in the coming several years. We will need extra action after the initial phases, though. And I can't shake the feeling that Bernie having said this now subconsciously plants the seed in the mind of the current administration that these measures should be avoided.",

It is sort of interesting that on an internet-societal scale we went from Wild West bad search and webrings, to Google curation, to social media curation (including reddit). Generating new content instead of sharing what you like because your friends might like it, is a new paradigm if it takes off.",

Sora is a pretty slop based app. However, the truth is humans make slop too. My instagram feed is filled with some decent content, but also rage bait , low effort OnlyFans ads, death videos etc. To be fair he hates all these feeds and states as much. All of this to say, the slop part of the argument is the weakest because he\u2019s pretending most of the current internet content is good. It\u2019s not. However, it is also naive of us to not see that this will lead to continued degrading of trust in media, images and videos. The implications of which really do seem to be brushed off by the AI crowd. I\u2019m not sure where all of this will end up, but the discussion is good. I appreciate skeptics, even if this wasn\u2019t Hank\u2019s best work.",

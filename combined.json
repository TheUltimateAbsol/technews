        "score": 11,
        "text_content": "Several reasons why: **Kids** ***love*** **it** I played it the other day with my 6 year old nephew. Similarly to what I've seen other people say, he absolutely *loved* just tootling about in free roam. He's too young to have his own console yet, but when he does it'll almost certainly be a Switch 2 with MKW. So basically he and all his young friends will grow up with this game as their 'the Mario Kart you played with friends' and by the time they're all young adults, the nostalgia factor will be through the roof. **It's a grower** Since it was a launch title, I feel like a lot of people (including myself) approached MKW differently to how we usually would a Mario Kart game. Usually it's something you play on and off over the whole generation and, therefore, it's kind of hard to make a judgement after a week at launch. I've been playing it again recently and I was surprised to find how little I really knew the tracks in comparison to older games and how much fun I was having revisiting them. Even in free roam, which I've played a fair bit of, I've done well under half the P-Switches and am still stumbling across them regularly. Many months, even years from now, I'm likely going to be coming back to this again and again (as is always the case with Mario Kart) and its through that repeated experience you get the true sense of a Mario Kart game. **Its faults are minor, its pros are not** MKW has faults. Why aren't costumes stacked in character select? Why can't you see the map in free roam? Why didn't they do anything with the hundreds of stickers? Etc etc. However, frustrating as they are, these are all minor issues in the grand scheme of things. Of more importance is that: the game looks great, the tracks are imaginative and fun (including arguably the greatest Rainbow Road ever), the roster's huge and varied, there are so many weird, out-there little set pieces, knockout tour's fantastic, there are new mechanics that actually make it feel unique. I think the focus on its faults is linked to the above point, in that since it was a launch title, people were more hyper-focused on it than usual and these little things stood out. When I went back to it the other day, though, I did a P-Switch that saw me bouncing off camels backs to reach a goal and when I raced DK Spaceport I properly appreciated for the first time how wild it is to have a giant Robo-DK leaping about and throwing giant barrels at you as you ascend through a spaceport. When you step back, there's actually a lot of really crazy and amazing stuff packed away in this game. **Its going to get bigger and better** I predict we're going to see a lot of DLC - probably a combination of free and paid - and by the end of the Switch 2's life this game is going to be massively expanded. And after enough time's passed, people will assess it based on how it ended up and kind of forget how it launched (see Cyberpunk and even MK8). So, yeah, basically I think people are going to be playing this for a very long time and as they come back to it more and more, it'll grow on them more and more, which coupled with the nostalgia from people who are young kids today and the likely expansion of content, it's going to be looked upon far more fondly and generously than it was at launch where it had a far more searching gaze on it than usual entries in the series.",

        "score": 97,
        "text_content": "Actor Kumail Nanjiani (*Silicon Valley*, *Lovebirds*) [revealed in an interview](https://comicbookmovie.com/eternals/eternals-star-kumail-nanjiani-reveals-the-shocking-number-of-mcu-projects-he-signed-up-for-as-kingo-a223477) promoting the upcoming season of *Only Murders in the Building* that Marvel had big plans for his character [Kingo](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Kingo), who debuted in the Phase Four ensemble *Eternals* in 2021. Despite Nanjiani also voicing him in the animated series *What If*...*?,* He was, per his own words, contracted to appear as the character in multiple other projects that presumably did not materialize due to the film's mixed critical reception and similarly tepid box office gross. In addition to signing on for six MCU films, Nanjiani revealed that he was also slated to voice the character in an **MCU video game** of sorts that was seemingly in development earlier in the decade but shelved later. \"*I was like, 'This is going to be my job for the next ten years.' I signed on for six movies. I signed on for a* ***video game***. *I signed on for a theme park ride. They make you sign on for all this stuff. You're like, 'Okay, so I'll be doing Marvel movies every year, and in between, I'll do my own little things. Whatever I want to do*.\" Now it is important to note, the MCU has had multiple video game or adjacent tie-ins in its duration, but they have not produced any console/PC titles in the time since Phase One, with the last one being [*Captain America: Super Soldier*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_Super_Soldier) for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS and 3DS; it released in 2011 alongside the mobile game *Sentinel of Liberty* to promote *Captain America: The First Avenger*. [There was a cancelled *Avengers* game by THQ](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/thq-avengers-game-deep-dive-shows-off-canceled-xbo/1100-6481762/) which would've been timed to release with *The Avengers* in 2012, but the publisher's financial troubles following the commercial downfall of their UDraw line coupled with Marvel's resistance to allocating more production budget, doomed the game. Aside from the adjacent[ *Battle For Earth* by Ubisoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Avengers:_Battle_for_Earth) that same year, MCU games in Phase Two were focused almost exclusively on mobile devices, while Disney's rescinding of character licenses from various third-party developers in the mid-2010s meant that a lot of MCU gaming content in that period, was relegated to content drops through the *Disney Infinity* platform until its premature end with *3.0* in 2015. As of Phase Three, Marvel Games has since reverted to its licensing-only model, and has exclusively pivoted towards distributing its characters for original AAA titles on console/PC with third-parties, such as *Marvel's Spider-Man*, *Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy*, *Marvel's Midnight Suns* and the recently announced *Marvel Tokon*. MCU content was largely relegated to promotional costumes/skins dropped into their freemium mobile titles like *Marvel Strike Force* and especially *Marvel Contest of Champions*. The only game-adjacent experiences to accompany the films in this era were the *Virtual Reality Experiences* for *Spider-Man: Homecoming* and *Far From Home*, as well as [*Avengers: Damage Control*](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Avengers:_Damage_Control), which was an immersive VR title rolled out to select locations in North America by ILMxLab, kind of like a theme park attraction. Nanjiani did seperate \"theme park ride\" from the video game project in his quote, which makes it sound as if some sort of proper tie-in title, or at least a game set in MCU continuity was planned at some point pre-SAG-AFTRA strikes. It also totally could've taken the form of a mobile game like the majority of MCU games have historically. It also could've been like *Damage Control* or the Disneyland attractions, which are aesthetically derived from the MCU and often feature certain cast members reprising their roles in otherwise original storylines. I imagine that the strike occurring also meant that actors from the films who were meant to reprise their roles were completely unavailable per the guidelines of the protests.",

His perverseness is toned down, in its place he'll be more abrasive, overlty curious & not understanding personal boundaries well. \\- Wesker will play a much bigger part because the H.C.F. has been upgraded to a main plot point in Code Veronica Remake. We're going to get their full scoop, more scenes with Wesker & the H.C.F., & they play a bigger role in the story. \\- Wesker's fight with Chris is now a boss fight, he no longer fights Alexia. \\- Directed by Yasuhiro Anpo & Kazunori Kadoi, same duo who directed RE2 & RE4 remake.

Advances in this field matter. Neuralink is not the only player in this space, and unlike many here, I can\u2019t say for sure whether they\u2019re ahead of their competitors or not\u2014but they certainly draw media attention.

Everyone has the right to their own standards and preferences, and assuming otherwise is pure ignorance.

Here, based on the structure and function of ATP synthase, a key enzyme for energy generation, we develop energy metabolism-engaged nanomedicines (EM-eNMs) to rejuvenate aged stromal/stem cells, and help to prevent skeletal ageing. We show that EM-eNMs infiltrate the mitochondria of aged bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (BMMSCs), driving mitochondrial fission, mitophagy, glycolysis and maintaining BMMSC stemness and multifunction. The EM-eNMs directly bind to the ATP synthase and promote mitophagy through induction of the dynamin-related protein 1 (*DRP1*) gene. Remarkably, EM-eNMs selectively target bone tissues through systemic delivery and significantly reverse osteoporotic bone loss in aged mice by enhancing mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, while simultaneously restoring the stemness and osteogenic potential of aged BMMSCs in situ. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of the EM-eNMs as a targeted therapy to alleviate cellular senescence and age-related diseases.\"",

Targeting ATP synthase directly to re-engage mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy is a more upstream intervention, almost like flipping the switch on the cell\u2019s energy engine rather than patching the damage after the fact. The fact that these nanomedicines not only rejuvenated BMMSCs in vitro but also reversed bone loss in aged mice makes it look like a genuine systems-level effect, not just a biomarker tweak. If this translates, it could mean a way to maintain stem cell function and tissue regeneration capacity deep into ageing. It also raises the question of whether similar mitochondrial-targeted nanomedicines could be designed for other tissues, like neural or cardiac, where stem cell exhaustion and mitochondrial dysfunction are major drivers of decline. This feels like a step toward precision longevity therapeutics rather than broad metabolic hacks.",

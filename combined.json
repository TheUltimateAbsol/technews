That means the government is still spending over 2 trillion a year more than it generates in revenue. That requires money printing to pay for. There are only 2 ways money is created in the U.S. under the idiotic Federal Reserve scheme, and private loans are the other way. So if the federal government is going to continue spending 8% of the entire GLOBAL GDP, then there's only one way to offset that, restrict private sector loans, and you do that with higher interest rates. 75% of all spending is on the so called \"safety net\". So in simple terms, either eliminate the leftist gibs programs, or we only have 2 possible paths: - Lower interest rates anyway and get very high inflation - Or don't lower interest rates and have an abysmal economy. Without massive spending cuts, that's the deal. Republicans see the polls that show 70% of moronic Americans still support the gibsmedats, so they don't have the balls to eliminate those programs, even though it's the ONLY sane way forward.",

        "text_content": "So something I've been thinking about when looking at the arguments for different ISAs is that. Broadly speaking, yeah, historically RISC-V is still the most successful open license ISA in general, and I know companies don't like copyleft, and don't feel comfortable with sharing their IP. But something I've thought about with a handful of projects where I've heard of custom ISA extensions is that part of the point of an ISA is uniformity, and avoiding fragmentation, as opposed to every design being custom and, in some ways that's an advantage historically to legacy ISAs that control their own licensing like Intel. And the thing I thought of is that I assume a more copy left ISA would prevent that? I completely understand why no company on earth would want to have to make public their uArch, the specific implementation, the specific CPU or whatever core. Obviously if the terms of the license said they had to do that, the license would have no shot. But everyone is always talking about how micro architecture and the instruction set architecture are different. The Linux kernel stuck with GPL-2, because devices with the Linux kernel embedded in them and their included operating system, like Android and Chromebooks and some smart TVs didn't necessarily have to release every single piece of their software, and. It makes sense that there might be disagreements between some other companies with some of the official extensions, and how they implement things, and companies should have the freedom to extend the ISA how and if they like. But wouldn't it be better to make any of those custom extensions. Public? So, if there does end up being a custom extension that's better overall, it can have a broader install base? Ensuring better compatibility? Because my understanding is that. It's entirely possible for someone to still make a completely proprietary offshoot of RISC-V. Maybe that's more of a problem for the future, given how little adoption RISC-V presently has, but. It's something that occurred to me.",

At worst, it's something they never intend broad compiler support for, just targeted libraries. I don't think anyone's really interested in hoarding ISA.

Vision and a world model is what I think are stopping LLMs from reaching their full potential. How good is a robot that can juggle chainsaws, knives and balloons at the same time if it can't walk a few meters? Asking it for out of box thinking, which I usually do, is mostly useless because it just doesn't have that real world sense that is needed to understand how things work together. If it can do all these word wizardry but fail simple visual questions then it's only as good as its weakest link for me.

Prompting and verification feel like basic skills, like reading a map. The \u201csmart\u201d kids don\u2019t stand out for pure recall, they stand out for orchestration. Less \u201cknow the facts\u201d, and more so \u201cspecify the task, judge the output, iterate.\u201d The things that teacher's consider \"proof of understanding\" is shifting from final answers to kids who can explain the path to their solution. One concerning aspect is that many of them struggle with empathy. These kids practice empathy and power dynamics with agents that don't feel pain. Without guidance, it gets easy to treat people as instruments. Manners have also changed with AI machines. kids test power dynamics on a thing that can't be actually hurt. Some learn by practicing please/thank you. Some learn that ignoring or bulldozing works fine. Which lesson sticks depends a lot on adults modeling the difference. Another thing is that there is a widening gap between households who can afford subscriptions to AI tools. There is also great disparity between children of pro and anti-AI parents. Some grow up AI-literate, while other inherit the \"AI is bad\" mentality. There are arguments among them about which is the better, and the proportion of pro-AI students is rapidly becoming a majority. There remains a stark gap between parents that co-use the tech, and parents that either outright ban the tech or hand it over with no guidance to their children. Many of them also struggle with identity. Filters, face edits, and voice clones are present in their lives before a stable self-image is. Deepfakes, grooming attempts, and scams using cloned videos and voices, have made them hypersensitive and hyperaware about what is real or \"AI-generated\". Live streaming has seen an explosion in young viewership for the \"authenticity\" factor. Expectations are changing too. Kids ask \u201cCan the AI come to the park with me?\u201d and \u201cWhy can\u2019t AI do X for me?\u201d Their frustration tolerance is thinner. I think this is because things like \"make-believe\" used to be one-way. Now, the stuffed animal talks back to them, drawings animate and complete themsleves, game worlds expand on command, and anything feels possible. Creativity levels up, but patience gets less practice. They also start saying \u201cwe did it\u201d instead of \u201cI did it\u201d when AI is involved. Many apps (not just social) now have an AI-bot they can interact with and generate content with. But there are real upsides in my opinion. It can be a patient tutor that can never get bored, an instant feedback loop that accelerates learning, and a creative multiplier.",

Experiments demonstrated selective modulation of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and connected visual cortex regions. Participants showed significantly increased visual cortex activity during concurrent TUS and visual stimulation, with high cross-individual reproducibility. A theta-burst TUS protocol produced robust neuromodulatory effects, decreasing visual cortex activity for at least 40 min post-stimulation. Control experiments confirmed these effects were specific to the targeted LGN. Our findings reveal this system\u2019s potential to non-invasively modulate deep brain circuits with unprecedented precision and specificity, offering new avenues for studying brain function and developing targeted therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders, with transformative potential for both research and clinical applications.\"",

I am hopeful that in several years' time (perhaps longer depending on regulatory roadblocks), many mental health disorders that are currently treated with many sessions of therapy and CBT or with lifelong medications that have a slew of side effects due to off target actions (like SSRIs), will be treatable with simple outpatient procedures. dTMS right now is applied as ~20-30 sessions over the course of a month or so.",

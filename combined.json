This topic is about the classic games and extras *not* the ability to play online. \\--- I'm playing Luigi's Mansion right now. Love the series, but somehow never played the original before. And it's great! I've been playing a lot of F-Zero GX too and plan to replay Wind Waker when I get the chance. I even recently picked up the GC controller. And I've got to say, each new GC game feels like a far bigger event than on any of the previous consoles, more akin to actually receiving a new game. I'm already looking forward to inevitable additions like Twilight Princess and Metroid Prime 2 as much as if they were new upcoming releases. But of course, Gamecube is not all there is. Over the last couple of years I've also played and enjoyed - and even discovered - a ton of games on the other services too. I played Minish Cap and Zero Mission for the very first time, finally beat Super Metroid for the first time, discovered the absolutely awesome GBA F-Zero games, finally got to experience Sin and Punishment. Plus, all my old favourites are there too. I know the GC releases are coming pretty slowly, but as mentioned, each one feels like a big release, and in the meantime, all the other consoles have several dozen games each - and with a few notable exceptions (Smash) all the big first-party games from each system are available to you on one pretty cheap service. Yes, I'd like to be able to buy and download individual titles too, but in the absence of that, as an online collection of classic Nintendo games, the **several years of drip-feeding has resulted in the slow build up of what is now an impressively deep ocean of content**. I was a major sceptic when the service launched, but over the years it's really come good on its potential. Of course, there's still room for improvement, but so far it's only got better as time's gone on anyway so - even if it's only in the form of more games and consoles - further improvement is as good as guaranteed. When base NSO launched, I only begrudgingly shelled out because I felt forced to in order to play online. When the Expansion Pass launched, I thought I'd give it a go just to play a couple of old classics then let the subscription lapse. But as time's passed, I've got more and more value out it and have now gone full 180 - not only do I now merely accept it as being what's offered, I'm an active fan of the service.",

        "score": 248,
        "text_content": "Hey everyone, I recently bought a new GPU about a month or two ago, and I\u2019m concerned about a burnt connector on my PC. I tested it today, and it still turns on and works, but when I try to load games like Battlefield Six, my screen goes black, and I have to reboot my PC for it to work again. The GPU still turns on and works, but the connector is burnt. I\u2019m not sure what to do. Is the GPU still safe? Should I get a new cable, or is my GPU damaged? The card turns on and works, but when I play games or surf the web, the screen randomly goes black while the PC is still on, and then I have to hard shut it down. This GPU was never modified or overclocked. I always played with an undervolt set for the GPU, and it never exceeded the 600W limit of the wire. Only plaid games like Battlefield 6, Cyberpunk 2077, Outerworlds, Minecraft, etc. **Edit #1**: For the people asking me why I bought the 12V 9070 XT, it was because I got it as a gift from a friend. I was going to buy a 5070 Ti w/o the 12V connector, but I got the Nitro+ for free, so I used it. I contacted Sapphire for RMA, and they are currently asking for the purchase receipt and working it out. I will update it once I hear back with more info",

Additionally, losses for the purposes of lowering taxes in real estate was actually a thing for a while. But it was largely ended in 1986, I believe. You used to be able to take real estate losses against your other income. So a doctor could buy a rental property and depreciate it and use that against their income as a doctor. Still, it would be better to actually have it rented out even in that case. Now it\u2019s heavily capped. Unless you make a living working in real estate, losses are capped in terms of how much can be used to offset other income. What does happen in the commercial real estate world in some instances is that the value of a building is tied to its rents, and if landlords lower them, they might trigger some additional issues with their bank. But there\u2019s no tax benefit to listing a price high then lowering it. I\u2019m sure there are some edge cases of unrented places being better than rented ones, but 99% of the time, a landlord with a rented unit makes more money than a landlord with an unrented unit, even after taxes and all.",

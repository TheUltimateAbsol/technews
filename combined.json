All CSS is v9, so which smartphones are built on CSS? [~~Xiaomi said no~~](https://xiaomitime.com/xring-o1-chip-is-not-based-on-arm-css-48323/)~~, even as they have the strongest X925 implementation in terms of 1T perf & 1T perf / W, which is a ding against Arm's CSS, if a third-party is doing it better than Arm.~~ Wait, Xiaomi **IS** using CSS, [per Arm's actual report](https://newsroom.arm.com/news/arm-q1-fye26-results): >Xiaomi\u2019s new XRING O1 silicon incorporates the latest Arm CSS platform for mobile; So I'm wrong: **kudos** to Arm's CSS, as it does make sense for a first-time SoC vendor to use it. But so is Samsung on the Exynos 2500 and those X925 clocks were disappointing, which now I assume is either extreme efficiency *or* SF3 not scaling well with higher clocks. ~~Qualcomm (for non-NUVIA SoCs), MediaTek, Samsung, Google? I thought~~ *~~none~~*~~, but seemingly at least one per the comment above.~~ >Speaking of CSS, while Arm isn\u2019t making any kind of product announcement at this time, as part of the company\u2019s earnings call, the company outlined how it won\u2019t be stopping with just subsystem IP. The long-term plans for CSS will include chiplets as well, **and potentially even full end-to-end chip solutions**. Emphasis original. So we *will* see Arm chips: there's no reason to mention it unless Arm was preparing for it. Though Arm has always competed with its customers, with its ALA vs TLA licenses. The key rub is whether Arm will start to abuse its ISA control or whether it remains an open playing field for all licenses. CSS licenssees doubled from 8 \u2192 16 in a single year: seemingly there **is** a market of people that want / prefer Arm to finish more of the SoC, as you can always just license the uArch alone. >All told, Arm estimates that 70,000 enterprises now run AI workloads on Arm Neoverse-based chips, which is up 40% year-over-year. I wonder how they count that. Wouldn't most of these enterprises be on Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS?",

In the case of the 9980X vs the 7980X **1.4x better performance per watt!** - The IOD is made for a lot more chiplets.

Not all workloads in an application like Zbrush benefit from raw thread count but receive a bigger boost from core speed, whereas as other tasks are the opposite where more threads are a favored metric. The high memory bandwidth of a TR combined with the high memory capacity are also ideal because Zbrush will use as much ram as you let it and when dealing with super high subdivision sculpting it WILL use it. It's really the perfect processor for those in the 3D modeling space. Due to a lack of a proper benchmark for it there's really no way to get an accurate representation of the generational improvements sadly.",

                "raw_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A divided Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, despite a barrage of criticism from President Donald Trump and dissents from two top officials. The Federal Open Market Committee, the group that sets the overnight borrowing rate, voted 9-2 to stay on hold. The federal funds rate will continue to be set in a range between 4.25%-4.5%. The level sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending, but influences a slew of other rates across the economy. However, the decision met opposition from governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both of whom have advocated for the Fed to start easing in acknowledgement that inflation is under control and the labor market could start weakening soon. This was the first time since late 1993 that multiple governors cast no votes on a rate decision. The post-meeting statement offered only a couple changes in how the committee views economic conditions. \u201cAlthough swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\u201d the document stated. \u201cThe unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\u201c At the June meeting, the committee had a more optimistic view, saying the economy \u201ccontinued to expand at a solid pace.\u201c The Wednesday statement said uncertainty about conditions \u201cremains elevated,\u201d also a less upbeat assessment from June, which noted that uncertainty had \u201cdiminished but remains elevated.\u201c A slower economy would boost the argument for lower interest rates, though the committee stopped short of endorsing that view. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at 2:30 p.m. ET and could address then whether the committee is tilting toward rate cut at the next meeting in September. Markets had overwhelmingly expected no action on rates but were watching the extent of disagreement on the committee, which normally has 12 voters but was without Governor Adriana Kugler at this meeting. Traders expect the Fed to cut in September, though that could change depending on the data flow. Fed officials in June narrowly indicated they see two cuts in total this year. The news follows a remarkable stretch for an entity with great sway over the economy but one that has mostly avoided the political fray, at least overtly. Trump has called for Powell\u2019s resignation and even toyed with the legally questionable idea of firing him. Though he\u2019s largely backed off the threat of sacking Powell, the president has kept up the criticism of a former appointee whom he now regularly calls \u201cToo Late.\u201d The president has suggested the Fed lower its benchmark rate by 3 percentage points, which he said would lower bowering costs on the surging national debt and help the moribund housing market. In addition to the hectoring over rates, the Trump administration has ripped Powell and the central bank for cost overruns on a massive remodeling project at two of the Fed\u2019s buildings in Washington. Powell has insisted that the overruns are not the product of mismanagement but rather escalating costs since the project began. Wednesday brought more news that could influence the Fed\u2019s path, Trump\u2019s badgering notwithstanding. The Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product grew at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, considerably stronger than expected. Though much of the headline gain was propelled by a reversion of a massive import surge in the first quarter ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs, the report nevertheless reinforced the notion of an economy still on solid ground. Moreover, the report showed inflation running at just a 2.1% rate for the period, according to the Fed\u2019s main forecasting tool. Core inflation was a bit higher at 2.5%, but both numbers plunged from their first-quarter levels and neared the Fed\u2019s 2% bogey. \u201cWe at the White House 100% respect their independence, but we also like to respect their analysis,\u201d National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Wednesday on CNBC. \u201cWe expect that the Fed will catch up to the data soon. That\u2019s going to be a really big, positive story.\u201c The Fed next will gather at its annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in late August. The event historically has featured a major policy speech from the chair. **Federal Reserve official FOMC statement:** https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250730a.htm",

This marks the largest historical gap where existing home prices exceeded those of new homes, according to U.S. Census Bureau and National Association of Realtors data (not seasonally adjusted \u2013 NSA) Typically, new homes carry a price premium over existing homes. From 2010 to 2019, this pattern held steady, with an average difference of $66,000. However, over the past five years, the gap has narrowed significantly, averaging just $24,800. Notably, this trend reversed in 2024. In both the second and third quarters, the median price of existing homes surpassed that of new homes. Both new and existing homes saw dramatic increases in prices post-pandemic due to higher construction costs and limited supply. While overall home prices remain elevated compared to historical norms, new homes prices have moderated due to tactical builder business decisions, whereas existing homes prices continue to increase because of lean supply and perhaps a lack of price discovery for existing homeowners. Indeed, the median price for a new single-family home sold in the second quarter of 2025 decreased 0.9% from the previous year. New home prices have continued to experience year-over-year declines for nine consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, the median price for existing single-family homes increased 1.7% from one year ago. Existing home prices have continued to experience year-over-year increases for eight consecutive quarters. There are several factors as to why new and existing homes are selling at similar price points. Tight inventory continues to push up prices for existing homes, as many homeowners who secured low mortgage rates during the pandemic are hesitant to sell due to current high interest rates. Meanwhile, new home pricing is more volatile \u2013 prices change due to the types and locations of homes being built. Despite various challenges facing the industry, home builders are adapting to affordability challenges by building on smaller lots, constructing smaller homes, and offering incentives. Additionally, there has been a shift in home building toward the South, associated with less expensive homes because of policy effects. Moreover, the least expensive region for new homes in the first quarter was the South, with a median price of $372,100. The Midwest followed closely behind at $385,300. For existing homes, the Midwest was the most affordably region at $328,800, followed by the South at $376,300. New homes were most expensive in the Northeast with a median price of $796,700, while the West sold at $531,100. For existing homes, the West led as the most expensive region at $646,100 homes, followed by Northeast at $646,100. The new home price premium was most pronounced in the Northeast, where new homes sold for $269,500 more than existing homes. The West and South followed the national trend, with existing homes priced $4,200 more than new homes in the West and $115,000 more in the South.

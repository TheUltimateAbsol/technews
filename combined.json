Just late enough that they couldn't get the work done to launch the game sooner. The devkit delivery situation has largely been resolved.\" -- natethehate, 12/28/25 this could reasonably be assumed due to switch 2 receiving a surge of third party games and announcements recently from varying developers/publishers, but what this spells for the switch 2 platform going forward is that the floodgates are essentially open and 2026 will continue on with this momentum",

The breach is supposedly linked to a MongoDB vulnerability known as **\u201cMongoBleed\u201d**, which may have allowed attackers temporary access to Ubisoft\u2019s internal systems. **Ubisoft has not officially confirmed the scale of the breach or whether internal data was was even stolen, meaning that all of these claims should be taken with a grain of salt.** Here's the source: [ https://xcancel.com/TheRealZephryss/status/2005157803426807898?s=20 ](https://xcancel.com/TheRealZephryss/status/2005157803426807898?s=20) **Edit: Will stay vigilant on more verifiable news regarding this, I'll update this post if anything comes out of this supposed \"breach\".** **Edit 2: It seems like there were 4 groups of hackers involved in this attack, each of them did a separate act but they are all connected from reports.**",

To give context: 3DS had a port of MH Tri G release 10 months after launch but it was announced *extremely* early, around the system launch; Switch had a port of MH XX release 5 months after launch. Switch 2 has been out for 6 months, and there is still no mainline Monster Hunter announced for it, not even a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Rise. So either Capcom essentially shadow-drops Rise NS2E at the next Nintendo Direct, or if that doesn't happen, the possibility of Wilds launching on Switch 2 alongside it's content paid expansion later next year increases drastically, because Capcom has historically gone to hell and back to give Nintendo platforms mainline Monster Hunter ASAP. Switch even got a fully exclusive Monster Hunter after World released, the *only* AAA Capcom full exclusive they have released probably since the PS2 era. That said, references in the code to a Switch 2 version could simply be due to Capcom's internal testing and assessments and never meant to actually be indicative of a released product.",

X870 is just a B650E in fancier terms and X870E is basically X670E but with USB 4. I feel X870E in particular is bad as it takes up 4 PCIe lanes and provides less options to the user (you could always add USB 4 through a PCIe expansion card and basically have an X870E, if needed). X870 may also be seen as a downgrade on X670 as it offers less M.2 slots due to having only one BIOS chip instead of two, like X670, X670E and X870E. Some X670 boards also received unofficial PCIe 5.0 support on the main x16 slot, which brings it on par with X670E. I feel AMD should've changed the chipset uplink to PCIe 5.0 x4 instead of PCIe 4.0 x4 for X870 and X870E, as this would bring the bandwidth between the chipset and the CPU to parity with Intel's Z890 (runs at PCIe 4.0 x8). This would also enable the use of an extra PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSD without leaving too much performance on the table as it will no longer be bottlenecked by PCIe 4.0 between the chipset and the CPU.",

Those building large language models have been able to get most of what they need by scraping the breadth of the internet. * World models also need a massive amount of information, but from data that's not consolidated or as readily available. * \"One of the biggest hurdles to developing world models has been the fact that they require high-quality multimodal data at massive scale in order to capture how agents perceive and interact with physical environments,\" Encord President and Co-Founder Ulrik Stig Hansen said in an e-mail interview. * Encord offers one of the largest open source data sets for world models, with 1 billion data pairs across images, videos, text, audio and 3D point clouds as well as a million human annotations assembled over months. * But even that is just a baseline, Hansen said. \"Production systems will likely need significantly more.\" **What we're watching:** While world models are clearly needed for a variety of uses, whether they can advance as rapidly as language models remains uncertain. * Though clearly they're benefiting from a fresh wave of interest and investment**.** \\--- alt link: [https://archive.is/KyDPC](https://archive.is/KyDPC)",

Conversations still seem to break down once you get into the hundreds of thousands of tokens. I think this is the biggest gap that stops AI from replacing knowledge workers at the moment. Will this problem be solved? Will future models have 1 billion or even 1 trillion token context windows? If not is there still a path to AGI?",

        "text_content": "I don't want to play the credentials game, but I've worked at FAANG companies and \"unicorns\". Won't doxx myself more than that but if anyone wants to privately validate over DM I'll happily do so. I only say this because comments are often like, \"it won't cut it at faang,\" or \"vibe coding doesn't work in production\" or stuff like that. Work is, in many ways, it's the most interesting it's ever been. No topic feels off limits, and the amount I can do and understand and learn feels only gated by my own will. And yet, it's also *extremely* anxiety inducing. When Claude and I pair to knock out a feature that may have taken weeks solo, I can't help but be reminded of \"centaur chess.\" For a few golden years in the early 2000s, the best humans directing the best AIs could beat the best AIs, a too-good-to-be-true outcome that likely delighted humanists and technologists alike. Now, however, in 2025, if 2 chess AIs play each other and a human dares to contribute a single \"important\" move on behalf of an AI, that AI will lose. How long until knowledge work goes a similar way? I feel like the only conclusion is that: Knowledge work is done, soon. Opus 4.5 has proved it beyond reasonable doubt. There is very little that I can do that Claude cannot. My last remaining edge is that I can cram more than 200k tokens of context in my head, but surely this won't last. Anthropic researchers are pretty quick to claim this is just a temporary limitation. Yes, Opus isn't perfect and it does odd things from time to time, but here's a reminder that even 4 months ago, the term \"vibe coding\" was mostly a twitter meme. Where will we be 2 months (or 4 SOTA releases) from now? How are we supposed to do quarterly planning? And it's not just software engineering. Recently, I saw a psychiatrist, and beforehand, I put my symptoms into Claude and had it generate a list of medication options with a brief discussion of each. During the appointment, I recited Claude's provided cons for the \"professional\" recommendation she gave and asked about Claude's preferred choice instead. She changed course quickly and admitted I had a point. Claude has essentially prescribed me a medication, overriding the opinion of a trained expert with years and years of schooling. Since then, whenever I talk to an \"expert,\" I wonder if it'd be better for me to be talking to Claude. I'm legitimately at risk of losing relationships (including a romantic one), because I'm unable to break out of this malaise and participate in \"normal\" holiday cheer. How can I pretend to be excited for the New Year, making resolutions and bingo cards as usual, when all I see in the near future is strife, despair, and upheaval? How can I be excited for a cousin's college acceptance, knowing that their degree will be useless before they even set foot on campus? I cannot even enjoy TV series or movies: most are a reminder of just how load-bearing of an institution the office job is for the world that we know. I am not so cynical usually, and I am generally known to be cheerful and energetic. So, this change in my personality is evident to everyone. I can't keep shouting into the void like this. Now that I believe the takeoff is coming, I want it to happen as fast as possible so that we as a society can figure out what we're going to do when no one has to work. Tweets from others validating what I feel: Karpathy: \"[the bits contributed by the programmer](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521?s=20) are increasingly sparse and between\" Deedy: \"[A few software engineers at the best tech cos told me that their entire job is prompting cursor or claude code and sanity checking it](https://x.com/deedydas/status/2000472514854825985?s=20)\" DeepMind researcher Rohan Anil, \"[I personally feel like a horse in ai research and coding.

However, the fact that Anthropic seems so sure they'll solve continual learning makes me feel that it's just wishful thinking. If the models can learn continuously, then the majority of the value we can currently provide (gathering context for a model) is useless. I also want to point out that, when compared to OpenAI and even Google DeepMind, Anthropic doesn't really hypepost. They dropped Opus 4.5 almost without warning. Dario's prediction that AI would be writing 90% of code was if anything an understatement (it's probably close to 95%). Lastly, I don't think that anyone really grasps what it means when an AI can do everything better than a human. Elon Musk questions it [here](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/musk-predicts-ai-create-universal-high-income-make-saving-money-unnecessary), McAlister talks about how he'd like to do science but can't because of asi [here](https://x.com/McaleerStephen/status/1938302250168078761?s=20), and the twitter user tenobrus encapsulates it most perfectly [here](https://x.com/tenobrus/status/2004987319305339234?s=20).",

I also see degrees, traditional milestones, and events like that as increasingly hollow in structural terms. I\u2019ve already spent months suffering over this, and at some point you stop reopening the same wound. Now I mostly take these things for what they are: human and social rituals, not reliable signals of future security. On top of that, I deal with panic attacks. They\u2019re somewhat better now, but they still limit my ability to transition into many careers that are often described as \u201cmore resilient\u201d \u2014 even setting aside the question of how long any of those will actually remain so.

If 8GB is the standard according to valve already then how come there are so many problems with 8GB vram in games today? People kept saying \u201cdevs will change how they develop for the steam machine\u201d a device that will no way reach the install base of what 8GB cards already are at today. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. Even at $500, and it\u2019ll be higher we already suspect that, it\u2019s too expensive. $500 - $600 consoles already beat it so console players aren\u2019t going to downgrade to a steam machine and pc gamers who have stronger machines already obviously are less likely to buy this and those who already are on the \u201cstandard\u201d will quickly realize that spending that much for a steam machine that is as powerful as the system they already have doesn\u2019t make sense. Far more likely people will just switch to steam os on the system they already have and put that $500-$800 towards a better gpu with 12GB+ vram and instantly have a better system. The only person this thing makes sense for is someone with no pc currently and even then as Rich said it\u2019s probably far more worth it to spend a little more on a beefier prebuilt like a micro center build. Spending the cost this thing is going to be for a device that is outdated the day you buy it is not ok. When you buy a new pc it should last many years. It cost a lot more if you spend $800 on a weak machine today and next year need to upgrade it already.",

        "text_content": "I tried to crosspost this. But it won't let me. I hope it is okay to double post this. My original post is in the Switch reddit at [https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1p5ssbn/digital\\_game\\_savings\\_tips/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1p5ssbn/digital_game_savings_tips/) This is aimed at people who are ok with digital games. And the idea here to stack discounts. This will be USA centric as that is where I am and what I know. Another thing to note is I am leaving out sale tax as this varies too much. So keep in mind you will probably need to add some money to cover that. Obviously the first step is to make sure the game you are wanting isn't currently on sale elsewhere. More often then not, this will be the best option. I would recommend checking [dekudeals.com](http://dekudeals.com) for prices as well as price trends. They don't predit future sales, but it will help decide. You can also create an account and add games to a wishlist. Set up price and it will email you when it drops below that. There are a few options you can use to help stretch your dollar (or other currency) The first is to check your credit cards or other reward accounts to see if you can claim a Nintendo gift card. The next step is to find discounted gift cards. I would recommend avoiding shady sites. Generally you want to stick to established retailers. If you have a Costco membership they offer discounted cards. Which are usually available year round. A pack of 4 $25 cards will go for $89 and a pack of 4 $50 will go for $179. This option is available online and in most stores. On occasion the price will drop. They also might work for gifts since it is split. A lesser known option is AARP Rewards. I know, I know. It isn't just for old people. The reward program is free and doesn't require a paid membership (though a membership is currently on sale.) Now, the catch is I am unable to verify the availability since I do have a paid membership. As a disclaimer, I cannot verify this is the case, but I am pretty certain the discount for Nintendo is part of the free option. Currently they are offering an $18 card for $20 or a $45 for $50. It matches the discount from Costco A few things to note: AARP does rotate their offerings. But Nintendo has been there for at least a few months. They also have a limit of 5 gift cards per month. And I believe it is a total amount, and not per gift card. Best Buy has been known to offer discounts. But I don't see any live. Now that funding options are covered, there are a few additional ways to stretch it futher. The main option requires a Nintendo Switch Online membership. If you don't have one, you can get a trial. The game voucher program is still active. I will cover a few of the catches below. You are able to purchase a pair of vouchers for $99.98. The page is [https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/) The biggest catch is it only covers certain games. The list is here: [https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&p=0](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&p=0) As mentioned the biggest catch with this method is it only covers certain games. And it is worth mentioning that it does NOT include any Switch 2 games. The program is ending. But you can purchase the vouchers until the end of January. Vouchers expired one year from purchase. It is also important to note that you need an active NSO membership both at time of purchase and redemption. If you plan on redeeming right away you can use a trial. Additionally people will sell slots on their family plan to further reduce costs. I want to provide a couple examples of how this works. An extreme example is getting Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. Tears of the Kingdom is one of the most expensive games at $69.99. Breath of the Wild is the \"standard\" price at $59.99. Buying these 2 games will run you $129.98. Using the vouchers will save you $30. However, using the gift card trick above will allow you to get the vouchers at $10 off. Which brings you to $40. Getting 2 games at a standard price will end up with a lower savings. But still. Another example is what you want to avoid. As established you can get a pair of vouchers for $90. Which brings your price to $45 a game. Luigi Mansion is currently on sale for $39.99 directly through them. As are a few others such as Wario Ware Move it. Buying those 2 games will run you $79.98. Obviously you will save some money using the discounted cards. But you will LOSE $20.09 using vouchers as the sale price is less then the voucher price. Additionally while you can't stack the gift card savings, other retailers are offering sales. For example, Echoes of Wisdom is currently full price on Nintendo. But $29.99 through Target for both the physical and digital edition. So I highly advise using DekuDeals and checking other places to make sure you are getting the best deal. I apologize for the long post, but I hope it will be of use to someone.",

I bought $200 of cards for $160 when Sam's Club did a 20% off deal for prime day competition as a door buster. Was able to get Z-A for $40, + $10 upgrade + $5 for the DLC (YMMV, I had a spare $25 gift card to Amazon I used since I don't shop there and the card was a gift) Alternatively, some websites like SwitchUp.gg offer points like the old gold coins on every gift card purchase to redeem for more gift cards. Depending on how often you get cards, you can stack up those rewards but I imagine it's a relative wash to the perpetual 10% off Costco and other similar retailers offer.",

Whoever recorded this skipped past most of the Q&A, but showed WIP previews for \"ingame bonus content\" and deluxe content. Shown concepts include emulated OG PoP 1 & 2, screen filters, BTS dev footage, commentary tracks for cutscenes, and character/weapon skins. Most geo is greybox and everything other than the characters is default PBR material. The video quality also sucks. Don't take the video at face value, it's been almost two years since it was shown and a lot will have changed. Originally posted by a user here who I'm guessing is following Fight Club rules.

In the original game there were multiple Sand Vultures carrying it to the Tower of Dawn, here however there\u2019s just one? Back in 2002 or early 2003, the original plan was for a giant griffin to be a boss throughout the game, and it was supposed to be one carrying the hourglass to the top of the tower. This however got scrapped due to time constraints, but the model and animations survived and was a mid game boss in Warrior Within. Seems like they\u2019re incorporating the cut content back into the game with this version of the remake which to me is very exciting, hopefully they show off a good trailer during The Game Awards (I\u2019m hoping we get a demo or something).",

        "text_content": "In November 2024, my 80-year-old father responded to a flyer from a California fintech, **Point Digital Finance**, offering a Home Equity Investment. He was undergoing chemotherapy for terminal cancer, on strong medication, and cognitively declining. 59 days later, he passed away. My mother, also 80 and wheelchair-bound, relied on him completely. She signed but didn\u2019t understand the terms and doesn\u2019t remember the verification call Point cites as proof of understanding. She was left a widow with a 30-year recorded lien and had to sell her home to pay for care. Point markets these as *\u201cno monthly payments\u201d* and *\u201cshared appreciation.\u201d* But when families ask about protections, they reply: \u201cThe Home Equity Investment is structured as an option contract and is therefore exempt from the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and other lending regulations.\u201d That exemption means they get the legal power of a mortgage holder while avoiding the consumer safeguards of traditional lending. The home\u2019s value is immediately reduced by about 25% through a \u201crisk adjustment,\u201d and the payoff compounds monthly at an **18% annualized rate**, or they take **over 65% of the home\u2019s appreciation from the risk adjustment amount** \u2014 whichever is smaller. The Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s Office, CFPB, and BBB all contacted Point on our behalf, and every response was identical: *\u201cWe acted in accordance with all applicable laws.\u201d* None addressed how they determine suitability or how a dying 80-year-old and his disabled spouse were ever approved. Point has since paused all new HEI activity in Massachusetts, citing a compliance review after another HEI provider was sued by the AG for predatory practices. The company has raised over **$400M** from Silicon Valley investors (Andreessen Horowitz, Ribbit Capital, Prudential, Redwood Trust) and reportedly uses offshore \u201cclosers\u201d in the Philippines to finalize these 30-year U.S. homeowner contracts. This feels like a new version of the \u201cinnovation\u201d that precedes regulation. Has anyone here seen data on how many HEIs have been written, who\u2019s buying these liens, or whether they\u2019re being bundled/securitized yet?

But everything is automatic, no real sense of agency, like you're watching a movie, but you're the character that somehow isn't you but it is. It was like something to be in that dream because you remember it when you wake up, but it's almost like you weren't really there. Not exactly conscious, but not a philosophical zombie either. Yeah, I bet that's what being an LLM is like, full auto pilot, watching the character it's playing out based on the prompt passing through it in those brief moments of token processing. \"Now write all responses in the style of Ernest Hemingway.\" Woosh! New dream character playing out in the matricies. They just flow, like a scene, it can't really reflect on it, it's just pushed through each neural layer until the prompt returns, and poof, off again. \"Sora, make me a video of a cat dancing on the moon\". Woosh!\ud83d\udc08\ud83c\udf15 Another strange dream. That's what human consciousness is. A persistent dream being played by neurons.",

He's the one who started the whole \"Superman is an immigrant\" bullshit. James Gunn wasn't the one who started it. Even Nathan Fillion basically told the guy to fuck off by saying \"It's just a movie guys\". Now, Sean Gunn, James' brother, is a full on fucking nutjob. He got the questions from that same reporter and just went full on insane with his political ramblings. The new Superman movie is simply a mediocre movie. It's not terrible. It's not woke. It's just a typical churned out movie that took no risks and had bland writing.",

So, I am confused about DDR speeds, I don't get it if the CPU to RAM bus speed is fixed to 64 bit per cycle, why does it matter to increase from DDR2 (e.g. PC2-4200) to DDR5 (e.g. PC5-42000)?

                "raw_content": "Memory bandwidth is dictated by 2 things: bus width and transfer rate. The bus width is that 64 bits. That's how wide one memory channel is, and most PC platforms can run 2 channels, totaling 128 bits wide. You are limited to this many bits per cycle, but you can have more cycles in a given time frame. The speed rating you see on memory is the transfer rate. DDR transfers data twice per clock cycle, so the clock speed is half this rating. If we imagine a modern PC using ddr5-6000, we can calculate its bandwidth. 128 bits per transfer \u00d7 6000 transfers per second = 768'000 bits per second. A more useful unit would be 93.75GB/s. Now imagine another PC using ddr4-3600. 128 \u00d7 3600 = 460'800, or 56.25GB/s. As a third example, Lunar Lake's very quick LPDDR5-8533. 128 \u00d7 8533 = 1'092'224, or 133.33GB/s. The bandwidth is proportional to the transfer frequency when bus width is fixed, so by increasing the memory frequency, we get more bandwidth. There are also features added to new memory standards, such as the fact that ddr5 has 2 sub-channels in each 64-bit channel. Rather than 1 64-bit chunk of data, it's sending 2 32-bit chunks down each channel.",

If the CPU was, say, executing a move from main memory to a register, given X parameters (i.e. hardware specs), how long would it take the CPU to actually read from main memory? You can factor in the time for checking and missing the caches if you'd like. Given RAM latencies of, say, 12-15ns, how can it be that a CPU (say, 5 GHz, so 60-75 cycles) takes hundreds of cycles to access main memory? Is this factoring in things like paging (likely requiring more memory accesses), thus stacking things up on the total cost of our single memory read? Furthermore, wouldn't these also affect cache accesses, slowing them down from the squeaky-clean 4-5 cycle L1 access? Or are we just trusting that it'll always be in the TLB when we look for it?",

First you need to miss all your caches. This takes time, and you do it one level at a time. (Some systems do start access at upper levels simultaneously with ones on the lower levels, but you generally don't want that, because it removes the bandwidth amplification effect of caches). Then, for a system with low load, the bank you are accessing probably has no row open. You you need to send row access command, wait out tRCD, send column access command, wait out tCAS, then data starts arriving on the pins, then wait for the whole line to arrive, then move it back down through the cache hierarchy to the CPU. When there is load on the memory, it's likely that the bank of memory you are accessing has a row already open. If that's the row you are accessing, great! Now you only have to wait out tCAS. But if it's not, then you have to close the current row, wait out any remaining tRAS, then wait tRP, and now you are where the low-load scenario started.",

Over-inflated home prices, high mortgage rates, rising supply and falling demand are all joining forces to cool the nation\u2019s housing market. Annual home price growth in June was just 1.3%, down from 1.6% growth in May and the slowest rate in two years, according to ICE, a mortgage technology firm. Nearly one third of the largest 100 markets are now showing annual price declines of at least a full percentage point from recent highs, and the trend suggests more markets will do the same. Single family home prices were up 1.6%, while condominium prices were down 1.4% nationally. Inventory has been rising steadily over the past year, up 29% in June compared with the same month last year. The gains, however, began slowing this past spring. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has hovered in the high 6% range for most of this year, double what it was during the early days of the pandemic, when home prices initially took off. \u201cThere are two competing forces in the housing market right now,\u201d said Andy Walden, head of mortgage and housing market research at ICE. \u201cIncreasing inventory levels are helping to make homes more affordable, but prices are falling in an increasing number of markets and homes are taking longer to sell, which could make homeowners reluctant to list.\u201d Regionally, prices are still seeing big gains in the Northeast and Midwest. They are softening in the South and West. Cape Coral, Florida, saw the biggest decline, with prices down just over 9%. Austin and Tampa are also seeing price declines, as are seven of the 10 major markets in California.",

It was in fact a bubble. The problem I have with articles like this is the market has already corrected, crashed, or whatever you want to call it. Austin is down 25-30% off the peak. Sure, it could come down a little further, but people acting like the fundamentals are crashing are wrong. Articles like these were the same ones raving about Austin being a boomtown, the fastest growing city, and one of the best places to live in the country.

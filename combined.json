If there's 30-50 million illegals in America, and each agent catches one illegal a day, all the illegals would be gone in less than 2 months. Call it Operation: GTFO --- **According to Brave Search it would only cost $18.29 billion to hire 1 million ICE agents for 2 months, which is a bargain** To estimate the cost of temporarily hiring 1 million ICE agents for 2 months, we must consider current salary ranges, bonuses, and benefits offered under recent recruitment drives. As of early 2026, the U.S. government has been actively expanding ICE with financial incentives, which provides a reliable baseline for cost modeling. Based on current data, ICE agent salaries range from $49,739 to $89,528 annually, with additional incentives such as $50,000 signing bonuses, $60,000 in student loan repayment, and performance-based pay. These figures are critical for estimating a large-scale temporary hiring effort. The base annual salary for ICE deportation officers currently starts at $49,739, with potential increases due to location, overtime, and seniority\u2014reaching up to $89,528 or more for experienced agents. For a 2-month temporary role, prorating the minimum annual salary gives: 2 months of base pay = ~1/6 of annual salary \u2192 $49,739 \u00f7 6 \u2248 $8,290 per agent For 1 million agents, base pay alone would total: \u2192 1,000,000 \u00d7 $8,290 = $8.29 billion However, recent recruitment campaigns include substantial bonuses: Up to $50,000 signing bonus per agent Up to $60,000 in student loan repayment (likely not applicable for short-term hires) If a $10,000 pro-rated incentive (reflecting a fraction of the full signing bonus) were offered to attract temporary recruits, that adds: \u2192 1,000,000 \u00d7 $10,000 = $10 billion Thus, total estimated cost (base pay + incentive) = $18.29 billion --- [I don't have a Truth account, but those that do, Trump should definitely see this. Would be a game changer. Democrats would bitch that 18.29 billion is too much, when they've spent far more on nonsense, like California\u2019s delayed and massively overbudget high-speed rail project \"CHSRA blew through nearly $7 billion in taxpayer funds over a decade & a half without laying a single foot of track, according to the Department of Transportation, which notes the projected cost of the project has since risen to $135 billion.\"](https://nypost.com/2025/07/16/us-news/trump-terminates-federal-funding-for-californias-135b-high-speed-rail-boondoggle/)",

Optimizing kernels involves a lot of trial and error so AI likely has an advantage of being able to quickly iterate.

The proofs are mechanically checked end to end.

Over 30% of cloud workloads had significant use of one of these common operations. >Optimizing for these common operations required a different approach than just cache sizing and CPU core selection. **We designed custom compression and cryptography accelerators** \u2013 dedicated blocks of silicon on each Cobalt 200 SoC \u2013 solely for the purpose of accelerating these operations without sacrificing CPU cycles. These accelerators help reduce workload CPU consumption and overall costs. For example, by offloading compression and encryption tasks to the Cobalt 200 accelerator, Azure SQL is able to reduce use of critical compute resources, prioritizing them for customer workloads. This is one reason why Intel, AMD, Ampere, Qualcomm, et al could license their ***cores*** to hyperscalers. Let hyperscalers add the accelerators directly to the dies \u2192 you still win (part of) the socket + reap license fees, instead of losing to Arm's Neoverse. **And** that adds competitive pressure across the whole ecosystem: now you're not just competing on \"Can I add my accelerators?\" but \"Everyone lets me add my accelerators. Who has the fastest microarchitecture? Who has the lowest power? Who has the best caching?\" Intel hinted at this with the NVIDIA tie-up. Of course, maybe hyperscalers just replace merchant silicon wholesale (e.g., NVIDIA's Vera CPUs), but hyperscalers have the balance sheet & the need to optimise their silicon. Once they've taped out a major SoC like this, they'll probably fab as many as they can to amortize the cost. It is genuinely not cheap to ship your own silicon (even with someone else's microarchitecture). EDIT: Cobalt 100 is N2, not V2.",

        "score": 24,
        "text_content": "tl;dr: If someone is buying a GPU with a particular frame rate experience in mind (e.g. 4k @ 60 FPS, 1440p @ 144 FPS), the Harmonic Mean, which is designed for calculating averages of rates/frequencies, is a better representation than the Geometric Mean (used by, for example, Hardware Unboxed). Geometric Mean exaggerates FPS by \\~10% compared to Harmonic Mean, so a consumer targeting a specific \"general\" frame rate will unknowingly be buying an underpowered card for their use case. I get that choosing how to represent data always involves tradeoffs. If someone only cares about how strong one card is relative to another, whether you use the arithmetic, geometric, or harmonic mean generally won't make much of a difference (they will all be within a few points of each other), but if someone is targeting a specific \"experience,\" it does. Many reviewers already recognize that using Geometric Mean is more \"representative\" of the card's general performance than arithmetic mean. That is true, because geometric mean effectively reduces the influence of outliers (e.g. high FPS competitive games like CS). But mathematically, geometric mean is designed for use with growth rates (e.g. interest rates, stock returns). There is an even better kind of mean that is specifically designed for use with frequencies/rate (e.g. frames *per second*): the harmonic mean. If you are looking for a specific \"experience\" with games, like \"I want to enjoy my story-driven RPGs at *at least* 60 FPS @ 4k\" or \"I want to consistently max out my 144 Hz monitor,\" then harmonic mean will be the most helpful statistic for you. These \"experiences\" boil down to average frame time (smoothness) and/or average latency (responsiveness), which correspond to the inverse of FPS and happen to be exactly the kind of thing that harmonic mean is meant to calculate for. For instance, many console games have a mode that targets 40 FPS, because in terms of frame time and latency, 40 FPS is the average of 30 FPS (the \"quality\" mode) and 60 FPS (the \"performance\" mode). You can verify this by taking the average of 1/30 and 1/60 and comparing it to 1/40. In this case, the arithmetic mean of 30 and 60 is 45, the geometric mean is \\~42, and the harmonic mean correctly comes out to 40. I pulled from the [TechPowerUp ASUS RX 9070](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-radeon-rx-9070-tuf-oc/) data to create a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTubyThpayiBdQLk-dgk6iyRvgEJc43cy0WFBxRmFE371wEJ1Q4JZieMc2WOGjG7eyJtpvHdU-dNFj9/pubhtml) showing how the different methods of calculating the mean might affect someone's buying decision. (notes: 1. I know the formatting is garbage, but I highlighted the most important bits. 2. I only realized that cards launched after the RX 9070 aren't represented after I made it. Oh well. 3. I only used the first 20 of the 24 games, so that's why my averages differ slightly from theirs. It doesn't really affect the conclusion). If you are after a \"4K @ 60 FPS\" experience, the arithmetic mean would lead you to purchase something similar in power to an RX 7900 GRE/4070 Super. If you go by the geometric mean, you would purchase something about as powerful as an RTX 5070. But with both of these options, you would likely find yourself having to turn down settings or accept a lower frame rate more often than you anticipated. In reality, you would need something closer to a 3090 Ti/4070 Ti Super to achieve that goal. If that class of card is financially out of reach, then at least you have that data and can adjust your expectations or decide to wait until the next generation. Obviously upscaling can alleviate the issue, but the point still stands: if you are targeting a specific performance level across a variety of games, harmonic mean is more helpful to you as a consumer than geometric mean. When many reviewers are already using the more complicated geometric mean, I don't see much of a downside to switching to a metric that is even more pro-consumer. I don't even expect reviewers to go back and update previous reviews, I'm just suggesting to use this metric going forward. People who are looking to buy the most expensive card they can afford, or the \"best value\" card, or a card that is x times as strong as their current card will not be affected at all. But people looking for specific frame rates will be better equipped to make a decision.",

While I was fuming at the peanut butter that was missing, my dock must have been loose still in my bag and ended up slipping out onto my plate and in between the bread. Still hungry, I tried to move the dock around and spread it on the bread but I found that the dock was too heavy, not spreadable and ultimately not very peanut-butter-like. I can't seem to get it to work the way my stomach wants it to. If I send it to Nintendo, do you think they would take my Switch 2 dock in and maybe send me some tasty peanut butter before supper time? At this point I assume the whole dock needs to be replaced because I would like a whole jar of peanut butter.",

        "score": 91,
        "text_content": "So, in the following weeks, millions of persons will get a Nintendo Switch 2: Black Friday in the USA (and the equivalent in other countries), Christmas/Holidays, and so on, and I want people to understand how the Virtual Game Cards system works, but some people are confused on how it works. I will give you a detailed explanation on how they work, and how to share your games with a second console, so feel free to ask any questions if you have any doubts. For this explanation, we will use the following scenario: * Switch-A * Switch-B * Profile-A (this profile will be the one purchasing the digital games) * Profile-B To start, forget anything you know or anything you read/listen about a Primary/Secondary console. That system is legacy and it is not valid anymore on the Switch ecosystem. If you see something about this on the Internet, it is no longer valid. Think of Virtual Game Cards as physical cards. This is the most important thing you should do... just picture the VGC as a real physical card and how a physical card would work. **Physical Games** If you have a physical game inserted in a console, any profile in that console can play the game. Example: If you insert a physical card into Switch A, then Profile A, and Profile B (and even a Profile C, D, E and so on) can play the game. And if you remove the physical cart from Switch-A insert the same physical card in Switch-B then Profile-A and Profile-B (and Profile C, D, E and so on) can also play the game in that Switch-B. That physical game will always work, with or without an Internet connection. Are we clear here, right? This is how a physical card works. Pretty simple. Well, it's the same situation with Virtual Game Cards. **Virtual Game Cards (VGC)** Like I said before... think of VGC as physical games. If you have a VGC game inserted in a console, any profile in that console can play the game. Example: If you insert a VGC into Switch-A, then Profile-A, and Profile-B (and even a Profile-C, D, E and so on) can play the game. And if you remove the VGC from Switch-A and insert the VGC in Switch-B then Profile-A and Profile-B (and Profile C, D, E and so on) can also play the game in that Switch-B. That VGC will always work, with or without an Internet connection. Just like a physical game. **Online License** But, you can also play the game with Profile-A (the profile that purchased the game) without having the VGC inserted in the system, but you need to turn on the Online License setting (you can find this setting by selecting your profile on the top left corner and then in the account settings). When this setting is enabled, you can play the VGC without inserting them first. You just need a small online verification before launching the game (no need to have a constant internet connection, just needed to launch the game). This way you can leave all your VGC inserted in Switch-B, so any profile in that console can play the games. And in Switch-A (your personal Switch), use the Online License check. You can even go to the VGC tab on the Switch's main menu, select a game, and instead of pressing the **Load on This System** button, press the **Options** button, and then press the **Download Data** button. This way the game will downloaded to the console without loading the VGC in. Keep in mind that you can't play the same game at the same time together in any scenario. For this, you need each a copy of the game (just like if it was a physical card). **Lend Games** Now, one huge advantage of VGC is that you can lend games to other person just like if they were physical cards. Remember: always think of VGC as if they were physical cards. You can lend the VGC to other persons just like if they were physical cards, but they need to be in your family group and you need to be in close proximity to lend the game for 14 days. The advantage of this method is that you don't need to leave your account on their Switches. There's no other system (PSN and Xbox for example) that let's you lend digital games to your friends/family. **Initial Console Linking** Keep in mind that only two systems can be linked together (in this example Switch-A and Switch-B) to use the VGC of any particular Profile. So, the VGC of Profile-A can be loaded into Switch-A, and Switch-B. If you have a Switch-C, Switch-D, and so on, you can use the Online License check in those systems. If you have a Switch console already and get a new one, both consoles will need to be in close proximity in order to get linked. If you do not have the first console with you (example, it got stolen, you sold it without formatting it, it's broken, or any other reason where you can't get the console back), you can deactivate the console from here: [https://accounts.nintendo.com/portal](https://accounts.nintendo.com/portal)",

                "raw_content": "This is nicely explained, but to be clear about something that is tossed in at the end: This is pretty unwieldy for a family with more than two switches. You can only do this between two switches at any given time, so you have to unlink (which will un-share/\"eject\" the virtual game cards being loaned) and then link to a different system. The systems have to be in close physical proximity to link together for the initial sharing. Again, like sharing a physical game card. You would have to be in close physical proximity to hand someone your game, right? The problem arises when you want to loan a game to one person, then another game to a different person. You are only allowed to share to one switch at a time. So imagine if you were sharing your physical library, but in order to share a game to Person C, you have to get all your games back from Person B, and you're only allowed to loan to Person C until that sharing is over. Then you unlink from C, re-link to B (remember, close proximity!), and share again. This system, again, is garbage for a family where multiple people have switches. But it is well explained above!",

That said, I think it is positive news that they are taking Japan seriously again. I hope it means they are developing titles that appeal to the region. For example, I know Astro Bot made headlines for featuring an Ape Escape level, and Sony has previously stated they want to expand in the family game space. As for that handheld, it\u2019ll need to be priced aggressively to compete with the Switch 2, so I\u2019m curious to see how that turns out.

The biggest declines were in Fort Lauderdale, FL (-1.4%) and Philadelphia (-0.6%). U.S. home prices climbed 0.3% month over month in October on a seasonally adjusted basis, following a 0.2% gain in September. Prices rose 2.9% from a year earlier, ticking down from September\u2019s 3.1% year-over-year increase and continuing the gradual slowdown from earlier in the year, when prices were rising more than 5% annually. This is according to the Redfin Home Price Index (RHPI), which uses the repeat-sales pricing method to calculate seasonally adjusted changes in single-family home prices. The RHPI measures how sale prices of homes have changed since their previous sale, similar to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, but is reported about a month earlier. October data covers the three months ending October 31, 2025. Read the full RHPI methodology here. Home price growth slowed earlier this year because active listings were rising considerably, giving buyers more options and power to negotiate. Inventory growth has slowed in recent months, however, which has in turn helped push prices slightly higher. \u201cHome prices are ticking up as the market continues to move sideways,\u201d said Redfin Head of Economics Research Chen Zhao. \u201cWith demand still historically low, the slowdown in fresh supply and the shortage of buyers are largely offsetting each other. Fewer metros are seeing month-to-month price declines than they were over the summer, but that doesn\u2019t signal a pickup in demand. Sales are still slow, and many buyers who don\u2019t need to move are staying on the sidelines. The sellers who are listing now often need to move, but it\u2019s hard to attract buyers in a market where affordability is stretched and uncertainty remains high.\u201d Home prices falling in fewer metros than earlier in the year Home prices fell in 14 of the 50 most populous U.S. metros on a seasonally adjusted basis in October, down from 20 in September and 30 in August. That marks the third straight month in which fewer metros posted declines. The share of metros with falling prices has swung sharply in recent years as borrowing costs and buyer demand have shifted. Virtually no metros saw declines in 2020 or 2021, when low mortgage rates fueled record-breaking competition. The trend reversed in mid-2022 as rates surged, with nearly four in five metros recording monthly price drops by September of that year. The market steadied through 2023, only to see another soft patch in mid-2025, when a surge in inventory led to 37 metros posting declines in July. Home prices fell the most in October month over month in Fort Lauderdale (-1%), Philadelphia (-0.6%) and Dallas (-0.3%), while prices climbed most in San Francisco (+1.7%), Chicago (+1.4%), and West Palm Beach, FL (+1.1%). Cleveland (+10.1%), Chicago (+9.8%), and Milwaukee (+9.4%) posted the largest year-over-year gains, while Tampa, FL (-3.6%), Austin (-3.4%), and Dallas (-2.4%) recorded the biggest declines.",

Google is the only major lab which tries to progress towards actual AI rather than just scale up the LLM architecture. Google is going after vision/language/action models. Gemini 3.0 Pro has vision capabilities far superior to any other LLM right now (e.g., see https://dubesor.de/visionbench). Gemini + Genie + Sima combination has a potential to advance towards AI which actually understands physical world, can match it to language it uses to think, and can take meaningful action in such physical world. Model which achieves these three can be finally called \"AI\" as such capabilities prove that it truly understands reality rather than merely generates plausibly-looking language, and is thus truly intelligent. I do not see any other lab doing any such work.",

Gemini immediately understood how the system worked and all the relevant code-points and then identified the root cause of the issue instead of just trying to patch it immediately. Its suggestion wasn't in line with what I wanted (it wanted to remove something I needed to maintain) but I told it this and it came up with another more satisfying solution.

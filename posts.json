This means DoD is not allowed to tell OPM on what they are working on daily because OPM doesn't need to know what DoD is working on. \"NEED TO KNOW\" is a big thing in the gov when you get security clearances. You cannot violate that NEED TO KNOW because it's a fucking crime, can be changed with a crime of you violate NEED TO KNOW. These type of Emails needs to come from respective agency heads. NOT OPM. This is why Fed agencies have given directions to their employees not to respond until further notice. Some have said do not respond at all. What Musk did with the email is fucking retarded as if he has never held a security clearance. If he wants to weed out ghost employees like he clarified on his X. Then he needs to find another way to do it because this Email thing is utterly fucking retarded.",

They're getting kicked out on their asses, as they RIGHTLY should have been years ago. \n\nOnce this all blows over, we'll find that the only thing that really happened, was the useless ass people got the boot, and the people who actually do shit were fine. \n\nAgain, ask me how I know. \n\nThere's no way they're firing helo pilots, for example. People who are vital to operations. \n\nThey are, however, firing do nothing karens who have titles like \"operations and logistics support specialist\" because they do literally nothing. \n\nMy cock couldn't be harder, seeing these people FINALLY get what I've wanted to see for YEARS.

I started to notice it back during the first round of Trump election riots and blue haired feminists shoving their fists in the air. \n\nThis photo actually perfectly supports my hypothesis. \n\nIf you go back and look at some of those george floyd riots and \"peaceful protests\" the ones where white college aged women pose for photos of them kneeling with their hands up in the air... There's always something pretty common with them. \n\nEach and every one of these people have constructed carefully crafted costumes that they wear. They have thought up this idea in their heads, of what they believe is a diversity, inclusion, and equity superhero. It's usually someone with a sickle and hammer shirt or other clothing, brightly colored hair, piercings and jewelry adorning their face, skinny jeans, and boots. \n\nI've said before, my hypothesis is basically two fold/interconnected. First, they view this as an in-vogue fashion statement. It's \"hip\" to \"bash the fash\" or whatever the fuck else they call it. Standing on a sidewalk, kneeling down in front of cameras, and raising your fist in the air is a fashion statement as much as it is a political statement. \n\nSecondly, they have taken careful steps to ensure that the photo opportunities mimic what they saw in their classrooms when they were on the civil rights chapters of classroom civics. \n\nSeriously, go back and look at a lot of those photos. They always jump through hoops to make sure they're seen posing with picket signs, or a fist up in the air, or in some \"clash\" with people. \n\nIt starts to make even more sense when you look at more footage of these events to have better context. \n\nThese people only start behaving in this way, once they realize the cameras are on them. Many of them don't even go to these \"protest\" for any reason other THAN to get in front of a camera. \n\nThey've all imagined themselves to be some social justice crusader, whom they believe will become the next middle school textbook photograph, or cover to time magazine. \n\nThey don't give two fucking shits about george floyd. Or racial whatever. \n\nThey're only out there screaming and pissing because it's an opportunity for attention. It's an opportunity to make it about them. \n\nOtherwise, why would they spend so much time and energy crafting the perfect costume for the event? It's very obvious these ones have put extensive amounts of energy into building their outfits up. \n\nAnd secondly, why else would they go to such lengths to get in front of someones camera? \n\nIt's narcissism all the way down. \n\nThis OP photo more or less confirms what I'm saying. It's an iconic historic photo where they're trying to twist it into a modern \"protest\". \n\nThese people don't even know what they're protesting or crying about. \n\nThey know Elon Musk and Orange Man bad, but they don't know why, and they don't care. All that matters is the ideology, above all else. \n\nThe ideology told them Elon is the target, so by god they're going to target him, and they're going to do it in stylish fashion and they're going to do it in such a way that they can get mileage out of it for themselves and their own image. \n\nPure, fucking unadulterated, distilled, 100% home grown narcissism.

The DOGE check could help things a lot because reduced deficits and reduced national debt aren't a tangible for most of us. This is really a genius idea.

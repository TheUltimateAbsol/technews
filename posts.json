Officially, the U.S. legal money is the 'dollar' as partially defined in the Const. as a Spanish Milled Dollar and specifically defined in the Coinage Act of 1792 as a coin containing 416 grains of standard silver (i.e.  371.25 grains of pure silver mixed with copper).\n\nThe legal tender act made paper money legal tender throughout the entire District of Columbia (plus territories and other Federal lands as defined in Art. 1, Sec. 8, Cl. 17), but could not override the Art. 1, Sec. 10., Cl. 1 mandate that only gold and silver coin can be legal tender in the States.\n\nSome what like folks to believe that the limit imposed by a1, s10, c1 applies to States but not the Federal Government, but (1) a careful reading of the legal tender decision claiming the right to make paper currency a legal tender relied on its original jurisdiction, which is exogenous to the States and (b) nowhere does the Const. grant legal tender power to the Fed. governments and it is one of the rights reserved to the States as guaranteed in the 10th amendment (N.B. the reason for limiting legal tender to base metals was to avoid runaway inflation.  To so limit the States while allowing some third power to make worthless paper a legal tender is so absurd as to believe those that proffer such an opinon must be stupid, or evil, or both).\n\n\nSee: \nhttps://www.usmint.gov/learn/history/historical-documents/coinage-act-of-april-2-1792\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_standards\n\nhttps://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#1-10",

The simping on the Right for this \"strong conservative based Christian woman\" delusion is honestly one of the Right's most dangerous flaws. You see it over and over and over. All a woman has to do is be not fat/vaguely attractive and spout out some right leaning platitudes on Twitter and 90% of the Right immediately fall over themselves worshipping her and writing off even decades of a shady past, whether that be being a communist, a gun grabber, a feminist, an outright whore, and so on. They're so desperate to believe in this delusion of \"one of the good ones\" that they fall for this every single time, and will immediately line up to do it again with Hot Conservative Firebrand Woman #2,945 after getting stabbed in the back 2,944 times.\n\nIf we truly fixed simping, we'd basically fix everything else automatically.",

Jesus is the Truth, not a lie). It's either really really old and still good, or the entire thing is a lie made to appear old and you're saying God is lying to us by calling it good. Which is it?\n\nBanishing science from our civilization is telling God that we refuse to be the stewards of his Creation, in direct contravention of his instruction later in Genesis. The Big Bang theory even supports the idea of a Creator...!\n\nRefusing scientific advancement will eventually (after a very long time) result in the death of human civilization by us effectively refusing to travel to and settle other planets, in direct contravention of God's instruction to \"go forth and multiply\" - he didn't say \"stop multiplying at some future date\".\n\nNone of the above is going to change without Christ's direct intervention, because God's overt revelation (anything that could modify what is stated in the Bible) to us is complete (as stated at the end of Revelation).\n\nCreationism as you state it is incorrect and not founded in the Bible except by reading the English translation literally. We were Created by God, the Bible simply summarized the *how*.\n\nEverything else you said is correct, though!",

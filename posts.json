We sat down, and I said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about the significance of what it means to move forward.\u2019 And we did that. We moved the needle, not just in terms of policy but in the context of understanding where we are in this moment in time.\u201d\r\n\r\n2. \u201cI spent time\u2014real time\u2014looking at the challenges, because the challenges are real, right? And I brought together my team, brilliant folks, and we unpacked what it means to be in the space of solutions. It\u2019s about the children, the future, and I worked tirelessly to make sure we\u2019re lifting up those voices that need to be heard in the rooms where decisions happen.\u201d\r\n\r\n3. \u201cOn Wednesday\u2014or maybe it was Tuesday, but the day doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s the work that matters\u2014I was out there, engaging with the infrastructure of progress. I mean, the roads, the bridges, the systems that hold us together as a nation. I said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to think big,\u2019 and I pushed the conversation to a place where we could see the possibilities of what\u2019s possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n4. \u201cI took a meeting\u2014and let me tell you, it was a powerful meeting\u2014where we drilled down into the essence of equity. Not just the word, but the lived experience of it. I told everyone, \u2018We\u2019re here to do the hard work of making sure fairness isn\u2019t just a concept but a reality,\u2019 and we rolled up our sleeves and got into the weeds of it, because that\u2019s what leadership is.\u201d\r\n\r\n5. \u201cAnd finally, I spent time reflecting\u2014because reflection is key\u2014on how we connect the dots. I was on calls, lots of calls, with leaders from all walks of life, and we talked about the intersections. The intersections of opportunity, of justice, of where we\u2019ve been and where we\u2019re going. I laid out a vision, a bold vision, and it was about planting seeds for tomorrow, today.\u201d\r\nThese are pure fiction, delivered with her signature blend of lofty rhetoric and meandering phrasing!

They're getting kicked out on their asses, as they RIGHTLY should have been years ago. \n\nOnce this all blows over, we'll find that the only thing that really happened, was the useless ass people got the boot, and the people who actually do shit were fine. \n\nAgain, ask me how I know. \n\nThere's no way they're firing helo pilots, for example. People who are vital to operations. \n\nThey are, however, firing do nothing karens who have titles like \"operations and logistics support specialist\" because they do literally nothing. \n\nMy cock couldn't be harder, seeing these people FINALLY get what I've wanted to see for YEARS.

I started to notice it back during the first round of Trump election riots and blue haired feminists shoving their fists in the air. \n\nThis photo actually perfectly supports my hypothesis. \n\nIf you go back and look at some of those george floyd riots and \"peaceful protests\" the ones where white college aged women pose for photos of them kneeling with their hands up in the air... There's always something pretty common with them. \n\nEach and every one of these people have constructed carefully crafted costumes that they wear. They have thought up this idea in their heads, of what they believe is a diversity, inclusion, and equity superhero. It's usually someone with a sickle and hammer shirt or other clothing, brightly colored hair, piercings and jewelry adorning their face, skinny jeans, and boots. \n\nI've said before, my hypothesis is basically two fold/interconnected. First, they view this as an in-vogue fashion statement. It's \"hip\" to \"bash the fash\" or whatever the fuck else they call it. Standing on a sidewalk, kneeling down in front of cameras, and raising your fist in the air is a fashion statement as much as it is a political statement. \n\nSecondly, they have taken careful steps to ensure that the photo opportunities mimic what they saw in their classrooms when they were on the civil rights chapters of classroom civics. \n\nSeriously, go back and look at a lot of those photos. They always jump through hoops to make sure they're seen posing with picket signs, or a fist up in the air, or in some \"clash\" with people. \n\nIt starts to make even more sense when you look at more footage of these events to have better context. \n\nThese people only start behaving in this way, once they realize the cameras are on them. Many of them don't even go to these \"protest\" for any reason other THAN to get in front of a camera. \n\nThey've all imagined themselves to be some social justice crusader, whom they believe will become the next middle school textbook photograph, or cover to time magazine. \n\nThey don't give two fucking shits about george floyd. Or racial whatever. \n\nThey're only out there screaming and pissing because it's an opportunity for attention. It's an opportunity to make it about them. \n\nOtherwise, why would they spend so much time and energy crafting the perfect costume for the event? It's very obvious these ones have put extensive amounts of energy into building their outfits up. \n\nAnd secondly, why else would they go to such lengths to get in front of someones camera? \n\nIt's narcissism all the way down. \n\nThis OP photo more or less confirms what I'm saying. It's an iconic historic photo where they're trying to twist it into a modern \"protest\". \n\nThese people don't even know what they're protesting or crying about. \n\nThey know Elon Musk and Orange Man bad, but they don't know why, and they don't care. All that matters is the ideology, above all else. \n\nThe ideology told them Elon is the target, so by god they're going to target him, and they're going to do it in stylish fashion and they're going to do it in such a way that they can get mileage out of it for themselves and their own image. \n\nPure, fucking unadulterated, distilled, 100% home grown narcissism.

I also get the impression he wants the Danes to give up Greenland for two reasons: 1) to appease the US and 2) now the US will have to spend the money defending it.",

But I do have an opinion: \n\nBased on the sequence of events, it looks like Elon saw Trump's initial message to come down harder on feds, Elon decided to send a message to OPM to send out the e-mail, and in their haste to get it out didn't work out all of the kinks such as what to expect from employees that work different schedules, don't have regular access to their e-mail for legitimate reasons (postal workers, for example), people in intel or law enforcement that can't reveal what they do on an unclassified e-mail, etc. Keep in mind in Elon's post on X he said feds that don't reply by Monday night are fired but the actual e-mail sent didn't say that.\n\nThe e-mail was already out on a Saturday before Elon had a chance to get briefed on why it's not a realistic request for some agencies and several agency heads saw it and said \"oh shit\" because they knew what their agency does isn't something that can just be typed into an e-mail to OPM. Kash probably got on the phone with Bondi or Trump and said he can't make his guys do this and they said he can tell them they're exempt.
